    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-16a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017111600044#WRA00600"><p>I met with the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Luxembourg in advance of the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 17 October.  This was our third meeting since my appointment. It was a constructive meeting at which we discussed the progress of negotiations to date.  I welcomed the progress that has been made in the areas of citizens&rsquo; rights and the Irish-specific issues.  However, it was clear that there are still many issues outstanding, not least on the issue of the financial settlement.</p>  <p>  In all of my meetings with Mr Barnier to date, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I have strongly emphasised the need for an imaginative and flexible political solution.  In so doing, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them.  I conveyed this position again on 17 October, recognising that these priorities are reflected in the Commission Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles paper of 7 September on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I thanked Mr Barnier and his team for their hard work and the progress made on the Irish-specific issues, most notably with regard to the Common Travel Area.  We agreed that there is still a lot of work required on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including sustaining North South cooperation and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  We are agreed that the Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Ireland and Northern Ireland should form the basis of the firm political assurances and tangible commitments required from the UK in phase 1 future and the ultimate solutions on the Irish specific issues as part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.</p>  <p>  We also discussed the issue of sufficient progress ahead of the October European Council. Mr Barnier informed me at that time that although progress had been made in the previous rounds of negotiations, he was not in a position to recommend to the European Council that sufficient progress had been made on all of the withdrawal issues to enable the negotiations to move to phase two.  While it had been hoped that the UK&rsquo;s position would be more advanced by October, Mr Barnier&rsquo;s position and the subsequent decision by the European Council not to advance to phase two, was not unexpected.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the sufficient progress required can be made in the negotiations in the coming weeks so that a decision can be taken by the European Council in December that discussions with the UK on future relationship issues, including on transitional arrangements, can begin.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-16a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017111600044#WRA01000"><p>Ireland has consistently been recognized by the OECD Development Assistance Committee for the quality of our aid programme and the emphasis we place on achieving results for the poor, particularly in least developed countries.  The OECD DAC has also commended Ireland for continuing its commitment to ensuring that our aid is untied, a consistent record.</p>  <p>  The most recent analysis from the OECD does indicate that the overall share of aid that is untied dropped to 87.1% in 2014 and 83.5% in 2015 after rising for several years to a high of 89.5% in 2013.</p>  <p>  Ireland is amongst the top performers of EU countries committed to untied aid, along with Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the UK.</p>  <p>  We believe that untied aid contributes to more effective development assistance for people and communities that need it most and that Official Development Assistance (ODA) is most effective when it supports the development objectives that people, communities and governments prioritise.  Untying aid also means that more aid is spent in developing countries themselves. </p>  <p>  Within the OECD DAC, and at the EU, Ireland has continued to advocate for the delivery of aid which is open, transparent and unconditional to support countries own national priorities.  We advocated for and welcome the agreed language in the new European Consensus for Development that commits the EU and its member states to accelerate efforts to untie aid and encourage all providers of development cooperation, including emerging economies, to do the same. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme will continue to focus on ending extreme poverty, hunger and under nutrition by 2030 and our aid will remain untied. </p></reply>

In these meetings, I raised regional peace and security concerns, and discussed the current political situation and Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic and development ties in Kenya.  I oversaw the conclusion of business agreements between Kenyan and Irish companies and discussed the potential for further trade and agri-business links between our two countries. </p>  <p>  I had planned to visit Somalia and was unable to do so because of a deteriorating security situation.  I telephoned the Foreign Minister of Somalia, Yusuf Garaad, to express sympathy and solidarity with the people of Somalia in the aftermath of the recent terrorist attacks, and was briefed on the fragile security situation and the important role of the EU in continued support for AMISOM.  </p>  <p>  I also met key representatives from the African Union (AU) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to discuss regional peace and security issues and the urgent need to find a political solution to the South Sudan conflict. </p>  <p>  The scale of humanitarian needs across the Horn of Africa is now unprecedented, driven by conflict, severe drought, massive population displacements and acute hunger.  During my visit, I announced additional humanitarian assistance to the Horn of Africa totaling &euro;11 million, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance to the region to over &euro;138 million since 2012. </p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU and UN partners, will continue to work to address the drivers of instability and conflict in the region.  We will maintain strong bilateral political and economic ties, and provide sustained humanitarian and development support to vulnerable communities. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-16a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017111600044#WRA01600"><p>On 18 January 2012, the Council adopted a package of measures aimed at addressing the continued brutal repression and violation of human rights by the Government of Syria.</p>  <p>  The measures currently in place against Syria include an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU and export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression or interception of internet or telephone communications.  There are no sanctions on food, medicines or most other civilian goods.</p>  <p>  There are numerous barriers to humanitarian access in Syria as a result of actions by the parties to the conflict, particularly the Assad regime.  I am confident that EU sanctions are not a barrier to the delivery of aid.</p>  <p>  As stated in the EU&rsquo;s Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures, &ldquo;Sanctions should be targeted in a way that has maximum impact on those whose behaviour we want to influence. Targeting should reduce to the maximum extent possible any adverse humanitarian effects or unintended consequences for persons not targeted or neighbouring countries.&rdquo;  In order to minimise the adverse effects of sanctions, exemptions for essential civilian needs and for humanitarian assistance, have been introduced in certain sanctions regimes, such as the Syria sanctions regime. </p>  <p>  On 29 May 2017, the Council extended EU restrictive measures against the Syrian regime until 1 June 2018.  This decision is in line with the EU strategy on Syria, which states that the EU will maintain its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters as long as the repression of civilians continues.</p></reply>

I have also discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with political parties in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I wrote to the US Secretary of Commerce in September to convey the concerns of the Irish Government, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, and had the opportunity to speak with him in person on the issue at a bilateral meeting in Washington D.C. on 4 October.  </p>  <p>  I outlined to Secretary Ross the Government&rsquo;s concerns at the preliminary finding and the implications the case could have for Bombardier&rsquo;s operations in Belfast.  I noted that the Government appreciated fully that the matter is a commercial dispute on which the US authorities must adjudicate.  I asked Secretary Ross to consider fully the significance of the case in terms of the impact on the economy in Northern Ireland, noting the important support which economic prosperity provides to the Peace Process.  I recalled also that the United States has been instrumental in brokering and consolidating peace in Northern Ireland and continues to provide immensely valuable support to the Peace Process.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to proactively raise our concerns on the investigation with the US Administration.  My Department is also maintaining contact with the trade unions representing workers at Bombardier Belfast, to keep them informed on the Government&rsquo;s engagement on the matter, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the findings by the US Department of Commerce are preliminary decisions, in a process that is not expected to conclude until 2018.  Bombardier have stated that they will fully contest the preliminary findings and that the implications for their operations in Belfast are as yet unclear.</p>  <p>  I note also that, further to the announcement of a deal between Airbus and Bombardier last month, indications have been given that the deal will support jobs at Bombardier Belfast.  That would be most welcome news, if confirmed, particularly for the people employed by Bombardier in Belfast who are most directly concerned. </p>  <p>  The potential impact of the preliminary finding by the US Department of Commerce on jobs at Bombardier Belfast remains a key concern for the Government, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  I will continue to do all that I can to assist on this matter and engage further with the US Administration in the period ahead, as and when required.</p></reply>

Any decision on a question as important as independence requires legitimacy both in the broadest possible political terms and in terms of the legal framework.</p><p>The resolution of the current crisis needs to be within Spain's constitutional framework and through Spain's democratic institutions.  It is for all Spaniards &ndash; all Catalans and all Spaniards &ndash; to shape their own constitutional and political arrangements, through their own democratic institutions and laws. </p><p>Ireland supports efforts to resolve this crisis through lawful and peaceful means.  I have made these points to both Foreign Minister Dastis, when I met him at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday and the Spanish Ambassador when I spoke to him recently.</p><p>Elections have been called for 21 December in which all of the parties can participate and which will give all Catalans a voice.</p><p>Measures have been taken to limit regional autonomy.

EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Yemen last April, and called on the parties to start negotiating a peace agreement.  Ireland will continue to support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team in their work towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict. </p>  <p>  The war in Yemen is having increasingly devastating consequences for civilians.  I strongly condemn all attacks targeting civilians, in all circumstances, which are contrary to international humanitarian law.  There have been numerous such attacks in the Yemen conflict, causing great suffering.  I also condemn the recent missile attack on Riyadh on 4 November, which endangered the lives of ordinary people.  Such acts are unacceptable. </p>  <p>  Ireland takes the issue of humanitarian access extremely seriously.  The closure of land, air and sea ports earlier this month, including for the transit of humanitarian aid, was an alarming development.  When my officials last met with officials from the Saudi Embassy in Dublin last week, they stressed Ireland&rsquo;s condemnation of the missile attack on Riyadh, and also made clear the priority Ireland attaches to unfettered humanitarian access.  My officials relayed my request that all parties to the conflict do everything possible to facilitate the delivery of aid.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue. </p>  <p>  I am encouraged by announcements by Saudi Arabia that it intends to allow the reopening of some ports and border crossings, which is an extremely necessary step.  I will continue to monitor this closely, and I take this opportunity to reiterate my call on all parties to the conflict to allow unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need.</p>  <p>  Ireland has close economic ties with Saudi Arabia, and this relationship has considerable benefits for the Irish economy.  However, this partnership does not prevent us from raising our concerns in the appropriate channels.  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians, with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani, in November 2016.  Following this, he also raised these concerns with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, both in the UAE and more recently here in Dublin.  More recently, when senior officials from my Department met with the Saudi Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires last week, they reiterated these concerns, and re-stated Ireland&rsquo;s view that there can be no military solution to the crisis in Yemen. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy is underpinned by a set of values which include the protection of human rights, support for development, and the promotion of disarmament &ndash; values which Ireland champions and promotes in its interactions with all of our international partners irrespective of any trading relationships. </p>  <p>   All EU Member States have signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), the first legally binding instrument to regulate the international trade in conventional weapons.  States which sign up to the Treaty are prohibited from exporting arms to countries if they know those weapons will be used to commit gross violations of human rights.</p>  <p>  I can assure the House that I will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen and improved humanitarian access in the future. </p></reply>

This landmark global agreement, negotiated by Ireland and Kenya, provides the framework for sustainable development globally.  Given their universal nature, Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the SDGs is being undertaken domestically, as well as through the work of my Department in supporting Lesser Developed Countries in their efforts.</p>  <p>  Effective implementation of the SDGs at national level requires a broad and integrated domestic policy response, as well as engagement by a broad range of stakeholders.  To this end, an Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, and an Inter-Departmental Working Group, chaired by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, are now taking forward the work in developing Ireland&rsquo;s National SDG Implementation Plan 2018-20, to be finalised early next year. </p>  <p>  Ireland will be one of 48 countries to voluntarily present a national review of implementation of the SDGs at the July 2018 UN High Level Political Forum.  We have seen from the national reviews last year that progress is evident in the implementation of the SDGs.  National governments are strongly committed to the transformative agenda and to leaving no one behind.  At the same time, many challenges remain and over 760 million people globally continue to live on less than $1.90 a day, compounded by conflict and fragility in different parts of the world. </p>  <p>  We will continue our strong role in addressing these challenges with the urgency they deserve, and in the domestic implementation of the SDGs with other Departments.</p></reply>

A number of key events, at home and abroad, are being developed as part of a programme to highlight this important anniversary and to celebrate the achievement of the Agreement, which continues to be the cornerstone of our commitment to peace and reconciliation.</p>  <p>  My Department, both here on the island of Ireland and through our overseas Embassy network, is supporting, and actively engaging with, a wide range of individuals, groups and institutions, who are considering and planning conferences, seminars, cultural and artistic responses, remembrance acts and other initiatives to mark the 20th anniversary of the achievement of this seminal Agreement.  Initial contacts with the British Government have also taken place to consider how best to appropriately reflect the key role of both Governments as co-guarantors of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s programme to mark the 20th anniversary of the Agreement will include events in Dublin, Washington, London, and Belfast.  These will include a new production of Rising to Reconciliation, which was developed for the 18th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and uses poetry, images and music to reflect on the troubled journey towards peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  All these events will also be an opportunity to reflect on the peace process, past and present; to remember the loss of life during the years of conflict; and to look back at all that has happened on the journey of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  This journey is of course an ongoing one, and the continued imperative to work to realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement will form part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the 20th anniversary. </p></reply>

The Common Travel Area is an important feature of the close relationship Ireland enjoys with the UK, with long-established bilateral benefits which enable activity between Ireland and in the UK in many areas including, for example, in trade and tourism.  It means that Irish and British citizens can live, work, study, and access health, housing, welfare and pensions in each other&rsquo;s countries.  Importantly, it also underpins the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  The CTA is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of both the Irish and UK Governments.  The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on EU membership.</p>  <p>  Work to maintain the Common Travel Area is ongoing.  The EU&rsquo;s Guidelines and Negotiating Directives clearly provide for the continuation of bilateral agreements and arrangements between the UK and Ireland which are compatible with EU law.  I welcome progress in the most recent rounds of negotiations on advancing joint principles on the continuation of the Common Travel Area and the support that has been shown by our EU partners to date in working towards this objective.</p>  <p>  The border issue is complex, but the Government has been clear in its position that there can be no hard border on this island.  I welcome that the UK Government shares this objective but I have been clear that it is up to the UK to propose workable solutions to ensure that this objective is realised.  The continuing operation of the Common Travel Area is just one aspect in addressing this challenge.  The work to date in the EU-UK negotiations on the Common Travel Area has been positive and, with my colleagues across Government, I will continue in my efforts to ensure that the Common Travel Area and its associated rights and privileges are maintained. </p></reply>

His appointment was another important statement of our intent and seriousness on this issue.</p>  <p>  Deputy Deasy has travelled to Washington D.C three times since his appointment in June.  On all three occasions, in July, September, and October, he has met with key interlocutors in Congress system, and the US Administration, to explore avenues for relief of the undocumented.  This relief can only come through legislative proposals, which, in the current US political climate, remain sensitive and uncertain.  Nevertheless, Deputy Deasy, in conjunction with ongoing engagement from our Embassy in Washington, continues to explore the available options, and sensitise the US Administration and Congress to the importance this Government places on the issue.  The Deputy will appreciate the need for confidentiality around the detail of Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s meetings, given the subject matter.</p>  <p>  The Government remains wholly committed to working with the US authorities to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish.  The Government will continue to articulate to the US authorities our keen interest in this area while respecting the right of the United States to set its own immigration policies.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to pursuing these matters on behalf of our affected citizens in the US, and our continued openness to routes and policies that will provide relief for the undocumented.</p></reply>

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s day to day role is limited to adjudicating on prisoners' access to the separated regime which separates paramilitary prisoners from the rest of the prison population and loyalist prisoners from republican prisoners.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will recall, a Stocktake of the 2010 agreement between the NI Prison Service and the prisoners in the separated regime at Maghaberry was published in November 2014.  It made a number of recommendations to be implemented within a period of six months.  At the time, the Government&rsquo;s strong view was that the full implementation of the Stocktake report offered an opportunity to create a conflict-free environment in the prison.  This view was conveyed to the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms. Theresa Villiers MP, and to the then Minister of Justice in the Northern Executive, Mr. David Ford MLA, and to their officials.   </p>  <p>  My officials at the Belfast Secretariat continue to engage on an ongoing basis with a range of interlocutors including the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the members of the Stocktake group, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (ICRC), and others to discuss, explore and encourage progress.  They are also in regular touch with the Criminal Justice Inspectorate for Northern Ireland whose most recent report on conditions in the prison, issued in August 2017, noted that health and educational provision is improving and that levels of disorder and violence were generally low.  The report found that there were still significant challenges around the separated regime.</p>  <p>  In seeking satisfactory outcomes in Maghaberry, the cooperation of both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and the prisoners themselves is required.  I would encourage all with influence to move forward in the right spirit.  The restoration of the Executive at Stormont and the appointment of a new Northern Ireland Minister for Justice would also be of great assistance in addressing prison issues in the round.</p></reply>

Primarily due to drought, millions of people across Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are facing crisis levels of food insecurity.  In South Sudan, conflict continues to exacerbate the already desperate situation, and while the famine declared in parts of the country earlier this year has been alleviated as a result of the international community&rsquo;s response, 6 million people are still severely food insecure.  </p>  <p>  Our Government is strongly committed to responding to the unprecedented humanitarian needs in the Horn of Africa. During his recent visit to the region, Minister Coveney announced additional assistance to the Horn totaling &euro;11 million, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance to the region to over &euro;138 million since 2012.  We continue to monitor the situation through our embassies on the ground and our humanitarian partners, and we will continue to respond.  </p>  <p>  We also are the fifth largest contributor to the Central Emergency Response Fund in 2017.

However, we also recognise that humanitarian aid alone is not the answer.

We welcomed the White Paper and the Reflection Papers as important contributions to the evolving debate on the Future of Europe. </p>  <p>  In September the President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker made his State of the Union address. </p>  <p>  In his speech, President Juncker proposed an ambitious agenda for the EU.  I have not had any discussions with President Juncker on his proposals.  However, the Taoiseach was actively involved in Future of Europe discussions at a summit in Tallinn in September and at the October European Council in Brussels.  President Juncker participated in both of these discussions. </p>  <p>  At last month&rsquo;s European Council President Donald Tusk formally launched his Leaders&rsquo; Agenda.

This marks the start of a process designed to engage the Irish public directly in a debate on the kind of Europe they want to see evolve.  Our aim is to raise awareness of the issues involved; to encourage participation in the debate; and to use this engagement process to help formulate Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the wider European debate. </p>  <p>  In taking forward this debate, our focus will be on delivering a positive EU agenda with concrete outcomes that directly benefit Irish and EU citizens. </p></reply>

Progress needs to be made in a sustainable and manageable way, which continues to strengthen Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in contributing to ending global poverty and hunger and providing humanitarian assistance.   </p>  <p>  During the very difficult economic circumstances of recent years, the Government managed to stabilise and largely protect allocations to ODA.  Since 2011 we have made annual contributions in excess of &euro;600 million and have cumulatively allocated over of &euro;4.5 billion in the period 2011 to 2017. </p>  <p>  For 2018, the Government has allocated just over &euro;707 million for ODA, the third consecutive year ODA has increased.

The latest actions taken by North Korea, particularly the nuclear test on 3 September, are a major challenge to international efforts to advance global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  This has been a longstanding goal of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.</p>  <p>  Our leadership on this critical global issue was given most recent expression when Ireland co-chaired the 31st Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Plenary Meeting in Dublin in October.  In my speech to the MTCR Plenary, I reiterated my grave concern at the deteriorating situation on the Korean Peninsula, and reaffirmed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to its denuclearisation.</p>  <p>  The deeply worrying developments in North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and missile programmes present a real threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, the entire North East Asia region, and indeed beyond.  Such actions represent a flagrant and provocative violation of North Korea&rsquo;s international obligations not to conduct such tests.  I have unreservedly condemned such actions.</p>  <p>  The government&rsquo;s concerns are shared by EU partners.  The Foreign Affairs Council adopted Council Conclusions on North Korea on 17 July this year.  The Council stressed that lasting peace and the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula must be achieved through peaceful means.  It highlighted the importance of the unity of the international community in addressing this challenge. </p>  <p>  On 16 October, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted new EU autonomous restrictive measures against North Korea to further increase pressure on the regime to comply with its obligations.  The measures complement and reinforce UN Security Council sanctions.  The Foreign Affairs Council also agreed to actively lobby for a robust implementation of all relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the part of all UN member states.</p>  <p>  The United Nations General Assembly in New York in September presented an opportunity for the international community to further demonstrate its resolve in this regard, and I conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s grave concern about ongoing developments.  In my address to the United Nations General Assembly, I unreservedly condemned North Korea&rsquo;s programme of missile and nuclear weapon testing.</p>  <p>  Most recently this resolve to implement the sanctions regime was re-affirmed by the European Council on 19 October, and a commitment was made to consider further responses in close consultation with partners. </p>  <p>  Throughout, we have been very clear in stating that North Korea must cease the series of provocative acts that have contributed to growing instability in the region and further afield.  It must re-engage with discussions on the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, immediately and without pre-conditions.  It must abandon its programmes to develop ballistic missiles, nuclear capabilities and weapons of mass destruction.  It must carry out these processes in a manner that is complete, verifiable and irreversible.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the international sanctions regime against North Korea, and emphasises that continued disregard of its international obligations will only lead to increased diplomatic isolation.  We believe greater emphasis should be placed on effective implementation of the sanctions regime, but further sanctions cannot be ruled out.</p>  <p>  The deteriorating situation on the Korean Peninsula can only be resolved by peaceful means, and we have repeatedly underscored the urgent need for dialogue between all stakeholders.  We will continue to be a strong voice for a peaceful outcome, and we will work closely with our international partners to this end.</p></reply>

Not least of these is the fact that Lebanon is host to well over a million Syrian refugees, a huge number for a small country with a population similar to that of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Lebanon&rsquo;s political system is based on ensuring balanced representation for the country&rsquo;s different communities, and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s role in that regard is very important.  I am very concerned about allegations of threats to the life of the PM Hariri, and also by the fact that any gap in the Prime Minister role risks opening the door to renewed instability.  I regret that Prime Minister Hariri has felt it necessary to submit his resignation.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a long-standing commitment to the unity and stability of Lebanon, as evidenced by the long tradition of Irish participation in the UNIFIL peace-keeping mission.  Despite the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, southern Lebanon has remained an area of relative calm since 2006, and the achievements of the UNIFIL operation and the role of our own Defence Forces in this success should not be overlooked.  </p>  <p>  When officials from my Department met with officials from the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Dublin last week, they took the opportunity to stress the need for regional stability, and the need to de-escalate tensions, instancing Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to UNIFIL and UNDOF as a practical demonstration of our commitment in that regard. </p>  <p>  I am continuing to monitor the situation in Lebanon very closely.</p></reply>

Dealing with long-outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland are of the utmost importance to the Government.  The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The 17th of May marked the 43rd anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which saw the biggest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.  My colleague Minister Flanagan, then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, participated on behalf of the Government in the commemoration ceremony that day and in addressing the commemoration ceremony, he reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s determination to continue - and to complete - our efforts to seek the truth of those awful events of 17 May 1974.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  I have spoken directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, about this matter and am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  </p>  <p>  As part of this engagement, the Government underlines that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also advised the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

In this capacity, I am working closely with colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios, including one in which no Withdrawal Agreement is concluded.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s previous contingency planning.  </p>  <p>  Aside from its wider co-ordination responsibilities, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has lead responsibility for planning for, preparing positions on, and following the EU-UK negotiations.  This requires research on and analysis of very many legal, institutional, and political issues.  The eventual outcome of negotiations will of course be decisive in determining the shape and effects of Brexit.  This work is led by the European Union Division in co-operation with the Ireland and United Kingdom and Americas Division, the Legal Division, the Political Division and the Trade Division.  Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and our Embassies in all Member States, send in a constant stream of reports describing and analysing the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our partners.</p>  <p>  These work streams are reflected in the Government&rsquo;s policy positions and public statements, such as the comprehensive document on the Government&lsquo;s approach to the Article 50 negotiations and our response to Brexit which was published on 2 May as well as through in depth analysis such as the series the Department of Finance/ERSI research papers on the implications of Brexit.  The Government will continue to consider how best to reflect the work ongoing across Government, in addition to the channels of public consultations and stakeholder engagement such as the All-Island Civic Dialogue and the Brexit Stakeholder Forum.  However, it would not be helpful or appropriate to publish detailed material which is heavily informed by confidential and ongoing analysis and discussions, including with other Member States and the EU Institutions. </p>  <p>  The Department is also analysing the possible impact of Brexit on policy areas within its remit, notably the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU&rsquo;s policy on international development.</p>  <p>  We have already seen the implications that Brexit has had for our consular and passport services.  There has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  In this regard, the Passport Service in Dublin, Cork and London as well as Consular Division have recruited a number of additional temporary and fulltime officers to meet increased Passport and Foreign Birth Registration demands including increased demand as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the European Commission and European Parliament Offices here in Dublin and with civil society organisations including the Institute for International and European Affairs and European Movement Ireland.  With funding from this Department, the IIEA is undertaking research on the future shape of the EU and the new strategic alliances that Ireland will need to develop within the EU after Brexit.  The analysis will also consider the macro-economic effects of Brexit and the EU institutional implications of Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  This work will build on the extensive analysis being undertaken by a range of organisations, both in Ireland and further afield, and will be presented in a series of public research papers over the coming months and years.</p></reply>

Ireland is pressing for an end to the violence, for restoration of humanitarian aid and media access to Rakhine State, and for full investigation of allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  In order to address the long term drivers of the tensions underlying the current violence, Ireland has also called for the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State to be implemented swiftly and in full by the Government of Myanmar.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined in previous responses in this House, Ireland is engaging in the efforts by the EU and in international fora, including at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, to press for a resolution of these issues.</p>  <p>  The ASEM Foreign Minister&rsquo;s Meeting will take place in Nay Pyi Taw next week and is being chaired by Myanmar&rsquo;s State Counsellor and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, Aung San Suu Kyi.

Phase 1 is focusing on the exit issues of citizen&rsquo;s rights, the financial settlement and the Irish specific issues.  Once the European Council has agreed that sufficient progress has been made on these issues, the negotiations can move into phase 2 and parallel discussions on a framework for a future EU-UK relationship and on a transitional arrangements.  Ireland fully supports this phased approach.  This phased approach was also agreed by the UK in the first round of negotiations on 19 June.</p>  <p>  The Negotiating Directives, based on the European Council Guidelines and as agreed by the EU27 at the General Affairs Council in May 2017, provide a formal mandate for the European Commission negotiating team, led by Michel Barnier, for the Article 50 Negotiations.  The European Council can revise its guidelines when necessary as the negotiations proceed and move into phase two.  Any additional or revised European Council Guidelines may subsequently require a revision, as agreed by the Council, to the more detailed negotiating directives.</p>  <p>  At its meeting on 20 October, the European Council welcomed the progress made in the EU-UK negotiations to date but agreed that further work is needed before it can agree that sufficient progress has been made on all of the exit issues to enable discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship and transitional arrangements to begin.  Decisions on sufficient progress will be made collectively by the Heads of State and Government of EU27.  In that respect, I welcome the call by the European Council for work in the negotiations to continue, and its commitment to reassess progress at its next meeting on 14-15 December.</p>  <p>  Once sufficient progress has been made by the UK on all of the exit issues, additional guidelines will be agreed by the European Council on the framework for a future relationship and possible transitional arrangements.  I welcome the fact that the European Council last month asked Michel Barnier and the Council to start internal preparatory work among the EU27 for Phase 2.  This was a positive acknowledgement of the UK&rsquo;s constructive approach to the Article 50 negotiations as reflected in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s speech in Florence on 22 September and an indication the EU is willing and ready to begin phase 2 once sufficient progress has been achieved.  While the existing Guidelines include elements on these Phase 2 issues, I expect that they will need to be adjusted and expanded as negotiations in that phase begin.</p>  <p>  The Government remains hopeful that, with hard work and political will, progress can be made in negotiations in coming weeks so that decision can be taken by European Council at its meeting in December that parallel phase 2 discussions on future relationship and possible transitional arrangements can begin.</p></reply>

These supports position companies to deal with their key challenges from access to new technologies and skills to being better positioned to adapt to economic and market changes.  This is done either by supporting companies to do RDI within the company, or by collaborating with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) or by sourcing or licensing new technologies from HEIs which can provide a step change in their innovative capabilities.  These supports all help companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies at all stages of growth and sophistication to engage in RDI. </p><p>In general, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s application processes include the following application criteria: </p><p>-  Applicants must show evidence of a commercial market for the proposed product or service.</p><p>-  Applicants must prove that they will develop a business that is built upon on a strong foundation of innovation and/or technology.</p><p>-  Applicant companies must be Irish based manufacturing or internationally traded services company which can show adequate cash resources to implement the proposed project</p><p>I have set out in a separate Appendix provided to the Deputy a menu of the other supports available from Enterprise Ireland to companies.  This is due to the large amount of information involved. This information includes details and eligibility criteria in relation to the following schemes or programmes including: In Company RD&amp;amp;I; Commercialisation Fund; Innovation Vouchers; Innovation Partnerships; Technology Gateways; Technology Centres; Campus Incubators; Horizon 2020; SME Instrument and High Potential Start-Up Support for Companies.

In this context, the information being provided relates to Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and PRTLI through the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  Due to the large number of programmes and criteria involved, I have set out specific details for the Deputy in a separate Appendix which has been provided to him.  </p><p><b>Science Foundation Ireland</b></p><p>Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) has demonstrated that the research groups which it funds leverage almost much funding from non-exchequer sources as they receive annually from SFI.  In 2016, SFI funded researchers leveraged &euro;133 million from non-exchequer sources from a total SFI grants budget of &euro;184 million.  The breakdown of the &euro;133 million is provided as follows.</p><p>Funding Leveraged Non-Irish Exchequer  </p><p>- Charity/Non-Profit Organisation (International): 1,617,986 </p><p>- Charity/Non-Profit Organisation (Irish): 672,125 </p><p>- European Union - variety of programmes: 71,370,495 </p><p>- National Institute of Health USA (NIH): 3,247,667 </p><p>- National Science Foundation US (NSF): 274,421 </p><p>- Other International Interest Organisation: 1,938,169 </p><p>- Other Source:  7,392,319 </p><p>- Private Enterprise: 44,826,760 </p><p>- Wellcome Trust:  2,094,121 </p><p>- Grand Total:  133,434,062. </p><p>SFI has a number of programmes in place to encourage and facilitate leverage of funding from non-State sources.  More detailed information is set out for the Deputy in the Appendix provided to him.  </p><p><b>Enterprise Ireland </b></p><p>In addition, Enterprise Ireland (EI) also provides a number of innovation and development supports aimed at assisting companies with product, process and service development.  These supports position companies to deal with key challenges from access to new technologies and skills to being better positioned to deal with economic and market changes.  While most of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) activities are funded by the State, there are a number of examples of where Enterprise Ireland facilities companies and academics to access non-State supports from other sources of international funding.  More detailed information is set out for the Deputy in the Appendix provided to him.  </p><p><b>Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI)</b></p><p>The Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions has been an important funding programme in developing research capacity within the higher education system in Ireland.  Approximately &euro;1.2BN of public and private funding has been invested through over the five cycles of the Programme, since it&rsquo;s commencement in 1998.  This &euro;1.2BN investment includes &euro;277m of matching funding.  This matching funding was derived from non-State funds, including private donations and own institution funds.</p><p>To date, PRTLI has brought together a significant base of both government and philanthropic funding to build research capacity and embed a research culture across the higher education sector.  A particular feature of Cycles 1 -3 was the provision of philanthropic funding of &euro;178m by Atlantic Philanthropies.</p><p>I am conscious of the impact that Exchequer funding has had in the past in enabling the attraction of other sources of funding for research and development activities in this State.  State funded infrastructure and consortia are a key attractor of matching funds from private (non-State) sources.  I am keen to ensure that future our future research and development activities continue to leverage investment from other sources. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-16a.96.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017111600046#WRC01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</p>  <p>  Without specific examples of the issues involved I can only respond in general terms setting out the processes in place for dealing with grievances arising under employment and equality law and industrial relations.</p>  <p>  Under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) a new two-tier workplace relations structure to replace the previously existing five workplace relations bodies was established.  A new single body of first instance called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was created from 1 October 2015 and a separate appeals body, which is effectively an expanded Labour Court.</p>  <p>  The WRC incorporates the functions of the Labour Relations Commission (including the Rights Commissioner Service), the Equality Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal (first instance jurisdiction only), and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  The Labour Court is now the sole appellate body for disputes under employment rights enactments.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Act sets out in the Schedules to that Act a comprehensive list of the employment and equality legislation that the WRC is statutorily entitled to operate under.  There is a broad suite of employment rights and equality legislation in place and complainants can make a complaint to the WRC under the various enactments for adjudication.  The Act allows that either party may appeal a decision of an Adjudication Officer of the WRC to the Labour Court.  </p>  <p>  Adjudication Officers of the WRC are statutorily independent in exercising their decision making functions under the extensive suite of employment and equality legislation but will of course be subject to the underlying provisions and any limitations imposed by the specific legislation.  For instance, under Unfair Dismissals legislation, an employee must, as a general rule, be employed for a year with the particular employer before a claim can be taken under that legislation.  Should an individual seek a remedy under legislation that falls outside the remit of the WRC, of course this would fall outside the jurisdiction of an adjudication officer of the WRC.</p>  <p>  In terms of industrial relations legislation, a dispute as defined in the Industrial Relations Acts may also be referred to the WRC under Section 13 of the Industrial Relations Act 1969.  This is subject to both parties being agreeable to the case being heard by the WRC.  In such event, the complaint will be investigated by an Adjudication Officer of the WRC and a recommendation will issue to the parties.  However, if the respondent objects to the Adjudication Officer investigating the complaint, s/he cannot investigate the matter and the complaint can then be referred to the Labour Court under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969 for investigation.  An appeal against a recommendation of an Adjudication Officer under the Industrial Relations legislation must be made within six weeks of the making of the recommendation.</p>  <p>  I should point out to the Deputy that the WRC and the Labour Court are independent in the exercise of their quasi-judicial functions.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I am satisfied that the major reforms to the workplace relations structures put in place in 2015 has resulted in a robust and comprehensive system that allows for those with employment related grievances to seek and obtain redress in an expeditious manner.</p></reply>

A consequence of getting such an Order from the Court was that the company concerned retained an exemption from audit. </p>  <p>  Section 343(7) replaced a previous scheme whereby a company could apply to the Registrar of Companies for its late filing fees to be waived.  A consequence of getting such a waiver from the Registrar was the company lost the audit exemption as it was still late filing its annual return. </p>  <p>  Section 343(7) was commenced on 1 June 2015. The number of Orders granted by the District Court in the course of 2016 was more than double the number of waivers granted by the Registrar in 2014 under the previous scheme.  This is a matter for concern as the timely filing of annual returns and financial statements by companies is an important transparency measure and safeguard for third parties such as suppliers, employees and other creditors.  Companies have up to 10 months to prepare and file their financial statements.  Any further delay risks making that information less meaningful to those third parties. </p>  <p>  For this reason, section 9 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 repeals section 343(7) and section 10 of the Bill replaces that repealed subsection with a new section 343A, to be inserted into the Companies Act 2014.  The new section 343A provides that a company may apply to the District Court for an Order waiving the fee required for the late filing of its annual return.  This is similar to the position that obtained before the enactment of the Companies Act 2014, whereby a company could apply to the Registrar. </p>  <p>  Companies that meet the thresholds for either the &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;micro&rdquo; categories will continue to qualify for the audit exemption.  The Companies (Accounting) Act 2017, which was commenced in June of this year, raised the thresholds for the &ldquo;small&rdquo; category to the maximum allowed under EU law, so as many Irish registered companies as possible will be able to claim the audit exemption.</p></reply>

The recurrent, annual cost of membership will be approximately &euro;3m.  The exact costs and scheduling of the payments is subject to negotiation and agreement with ESO.</p>  <p>  There is no joining fee for CERN and the recurrent, annual cost of full membership of CERN would be approximately &euro;15m per annum.  Associate membership is available for 10% of the full cost, or approximately &euro;1.5m per annum.  However, there would be a commensurate reduction in benefits with associate membership. </p>  <p>  In view of the intense demands on the capital programme and the tight fiscal constraints it will not be possible progress membership of both CERN and ESO in 2018.  Nevertheless, membership of CERN will remain on our policy agenda and my department will keep the issue under active review. </p>  <p>  Membership of ESO has been prioritised over membership of CERN because of the large, established community of astronomy researchers in Ireland.  Astronomy is an active area of research in each of our universities and several of our institutes of technology.

This is partly why many businesses do not yet have detailed Brexit contingency plans in place. </p>  <p>  My Department and its enterprise agencies are focused, however, on assisting companies to prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  This includes efforts to build awareness of particular and sector-specific challenges that Brexit is likely to pose.  Much of our broader work so far to help mitigate the impact of Brexit on Irish firms is captured in my Department's recently published response paper to the UK's impending exit from the EU, entitled "Building Stronger Business - Responding to Brexit by Competing, Innovating and Trading".  This paper summarises the policy measures already taken, outlines future initiatives we intend to take forward and details the steps the Department has taken already to ensure that we can work as efficiently as possible to support our companies. </p>  <p>  Our State Agencies have also been very active themselves in taking forward projects aimed at helping businesses in Ireland prepare for the post-Brexit commercial environment.  InterTrade Ireland, for example, has introduced a scheme to help SMEs avail of expert advice on Brexit.  It has also been working hard to raise awareness of the particular challenges Brexit may present for cross-border trade. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland, meanwhile, has launched a "Brexit SME Scorecard" - effectively a new interactive platform which can be used by Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  The Agency has also introduced a "Be Prepared Grant" that helps SME clients meet the costs of implementing a plan to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  Furthermore, the Local Enterprise Office Network are hosting information events around the country aimed at helping companies plan for Brexit.</p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping many different businesses prepare, we know much more work remains to be done.  That is why we will remain absolutely focused on our Brexit-related initiatives and will continue to explore new avenues and means of helping our companies plan for the future.</p></reply>

The Central Bank have clearly outlined the scope of their examination, and it will be up to them to determine, through deliberations with the banks involved, which customers it deems to have been impacted.  Investigations by the Central Bank are statutorily mandated and can lead to significant sanctions.  Therefore, as Minister for Finance, I must be cautious not to jeopardise any potential enforcement actions or prosecutions, and refrain from comment on any particular customer or group of customers whose case is under review as part of the ongoing process.</p>  <p>  I expect this aspect of the examination to be finalised as soon as possible, in order to minimise the uncertainty for such customers, and for redress and compensation for further identified impacted customers to swiftly follow.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that while they provide what is known as &ldquo;outline approval&rdquo; to companies there is no requirement for a company to obtain outline approval prior to issuing shares.  Therefore, the absence of outline approval does not prevent a company raising capital.  The conditions for the relief are objective, set out in legislation and subject to detailed Revenue guidance.  If the company meets those objective criteria, it can raise the financing with confidence that relief will be available.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue has advised me that outline approval is where Revenue is prepared to express the opinion that, based on the information provided, relief under EII is likely to be available for an investment in a company.  It is based on the information provided and as such, does not come with any caveats other than reminding companies that actual entitlement to relief cannot be determined until such time as the shares are issued.</p>  <p>  The company referred to by the Deputy applied for outline approval on 18 August 2017.  I understand that Revenue is currently processing applications received at the start of August.  The circumstances outlined in relation to the company are similar to the circumstances that all companies who are looking to raise funding to which EII funding are in.  As companies that are looking for outline approval generally express urgency, it would be unfair on those other companies to expedite the application by the named company.</p></reply>

As a result, it is difficult to compare like with like and comparing statutory tax rates provides only an initial indication of how taxation of capital gains compares across countries.</p>  <p>  Taking the statutory personal CGT rate applied to long-term gains on shares, which is the rate in respect of which up-to-date information is most readily available, Ireland has the 5th highest rate &ndash; 33% &ndash; of 20 OECD countries that charge such gains to CGT &ndash; the average rate being 28.4%.  It should be noted in this context that Ireland applies a uniform rate of 33% to all chargeable gains, regardless of the duration of ownership, whereas other countries may apply a higher rate to short-term gains or by reference to other factors, which, if taken into account, would result in a different ranking and average rate.</p></reply>

Where tax evasion is uncovered Revenue will seek to have the maximum sanctions applied up to and including criminal prosecutions. </p>  <p>  If instances of aggressive tax avoidance emerge, all such instances will be rigorously investigated and challenged by Revenue.  Where anti-avoidance legislation can be applied to recover tax avoided through the use of unacceptable tax avoidance practices and schemes, Revenue will seek to apply such legislation with a view to recovering any Irish tax avoided together with all associated interest and tax avoidance surcharges.   </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s work in the area of identifying offshore tax evasion has been, and continues to be, a priority.  The international environment has changed significantly in the years since Revenue started to investigate offshore bank accounts and other offshore assets.  Tax authorities worldwide now cooperate on a much wider and more intensive basis in investigating those who hide their profits or gains offshore than they did in the past.  Initiatives such as FATCA (an Inter-Governmental agreement to share financial account information with the United States), DAC (EU Directives on Administrative Cooperation), and CRS (the OECD&rsquo;s Common Reporting Standard) are all now helping to ensure that tax administrations have greater access to information in respect of offshore assets and income of their residents.  Revenue will make full use of information received from other jurisdictions under these new initiatives on offshore assets to identify and pursue those who have attempted to use offshore accounts, structures or assets to evade or avoid their tax obligations.</p>  <p>  In the context of these new information sharing initiatives now becoming available, the Government introduced specific measures in the Finance Act 2016 to ensure that, as and from May 2017, tax defaulters whose default relates to offshore matters are unable to avail of the benefits of the voluntary disclosure regime.  Anyone who did not come forward by 4 May 2017 to regularise his or her tax affairs now faces the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible criminal prosecution.</p>  <p>  Revenue will also work in close cooperation with other tax administrations, in the framework of the OECD&rsquo;s Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Cooperation, in addressing issues raised by the papers, and will, as appropriate share information with these other tax administrations under existing legal frameworks.</p></reply>

In February 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland acquired a range of assets following the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC), including Promissory Notes (non-standard instruments) which were exchanged for a portfolio of eight Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) (standard long-dated government bonds with a floating rate coupon, i.e. a regular interest payment which varies with market rates) amounting to &euro;25.034 billion. </p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s remaining holdings of these bonds (the FRNs) totals &euro;16.034 billion and the average coupon, or interest rate, (weighted by holding) is 6-month Euribor +266 basis points.  For reference, the 6-month Euribor as at 14 November 2017 is -0.275%.</p><p>The 6-month Euribor is reset every 6 months and so is subject to change on those occasions.

The coupons will again fix at 6-month Euribor on 14 December for reset on 18 December.</p><p>As stated previously, the Central Bank is committed to disposing of the assets acquired as part of the IBRC liquidation as soon as possible, provided financial stability conditions permit.</p><p>The Central Bank also indicated a minimum schedule of disposals as follows: </p><p>2014-2018 &euro;0.5 billion per annum; </p><p>2019-2023 &euro;1 billion per annum; and </p><p>from 2024 onwards &euro;2 billion per annum until all bonds are sold.</p><p>As at 15 November 2017, the Bank has so far disposed of &euro;9 billion nominal of the Floating Rate Notes:</p><p>&euro;0.5 billion in 2014; </p><p>&euro;2 billion in 2015; </p><p>&euro;3 billion in 2016; and </p><p>&euro;3.5 billion so far this year. </p><p>The Central Bank met its disposal target in 2014, and has significantly exceeded its disposal targets in 2015, 2016, and already in 2017.</p><p>Due to the volatility associated with the disposal of these assets, Budget 2018 contains prudently-based estimates of Central Bank income out to 2021, which factors in interest earned on the FRNs, however, it is not possible to give an exact figure due to the number of unknown variables.  Table 10 of the Economic and Fiscal Outlook  illustrates the total impact of the estimates distributed into the component which benefits the general government balance and the remainder which counts positively towards the Exchequer only (available at the following link: ).

This limit applies whether the pension is integrated with the State pension or not. </p>  <p>  Where a post-1995 recruit retires before the State Pension age of 66, their occupational pension is calculated to take account of social welfare benefits payable, so that when those benefits are payable, in full or in part, they are no worse off than a comparative pre-1995 recruit.  Where this parity does not arise their occupational pension is modified through a supplementary adjustment, taking account of social welfare benefits payable, so they are no worse off than a comparative pre-1995 recruit.  A public service pensioner may only qualify for a supplementary pension if they are not engaged in paid employment, do not qualify for social insurance benefit or fail to qualify for such benefit at less than the maximum rate, and their failure to qualify is due to causes outside their control.  </p>  <p>  In a further pension reform measure, the Single Public Service Pension Scheme which applies to all new entrants since 1 January, 2013, does not make provision for such supplementary adjustments.</p></reply>

The Bill consolidates the current legislative framework governing the ethical obligations of public officials.  It aims to significantly enhance the existing framework for identifying, disclosing and managing conflicts of interest and minimising corruption risks, to achieve a shift towards a more dynamic and risk-based system of compliance and to ensure that the institutional framework for oversight, investigation and enforcement is robust and effective.  </p>  <p>  The Bill was published on the 23rd of December 2015 and completed Second stage in the D&aacute;&iacute;l on the 20th of January 2016. Committee stage commenced on the 6th of April 2017 and 42 of the 66 sections in the Bill were passed that day.  The Committee requested that, prior to the rescheduling of the Bill for completion of Committee stage, all TD's, Senators and Local Authority representative organisations be written to by the Minister giving information about the Bill.  These letters issued on 10th May. In addition, a briefing session for Oireachtas members was held on 30th May.</p>  <p>  In an effort to further assist in the understanding of the Bill, Minister of State O'Donovan is currently meeting with opposition spokespersons on a one-to-one basis.  It is hoped that following these meetings, Committee Stage will be recommenced and the Bill can progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas without further delay.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be enacted in the first half of 2018.</p></reply>

This provides independent assurance that the appointee is of sufficient calibre and quality to add significant value to the work of the relevant board.</p><p>My predecessor as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform issued Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards in November 2014 setting out clearly how the new appointments process would work in practice. </p><p>In terms of the specific objective of increasing the participation of women on State Boards, the Government agreed to set a target of 40% female membership of such boards and that where a board met the 40% target that the aim should be to increase to 45%. </p><p>A database maintained by my Department on State Board Appointments (available at www.StateBoards.ie) shows that steady progress is being made on increasing female participation.  Some 40% of all board members are now female, although this percentage obviously varies from Board to Board. </p><p>Indications are that 48% of State Boards have reached the target of a minimum of 40% female membership set by the Government and indeed that some 35% of boards have met the higher 45% target.  This compares very favourably with the private sector, with a figure of somewhere around 13% female participation.  The position on individual State Boards is a matter for the relevant Minister.</p><p>Up to the end of September this year, over 500 appointments have been made under the new system.  Some 30% of the applications received for state board appointment came from women, who made up some 45% of the appointments made by Ministers. </p><p>As I mentioned, each Minister is ultimately responsible for appointments to boards under their aegis and must have regard to the Guidelines.  Relevant issues relating to the effective operation of each board, including those such as diversity, gender balance and mix of expertise are for each Minister to consider.  Personally I would encourage all Ministers, through their Departments, to encourage measures to increase awareness of State Boards in their sectors with the particular aim of increasing applications from women.</p></reply>

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size. </p><p>Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of 40 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated 42.05 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016/17. </p><p>There has therefore been no reduction to the allocation of special educational needs teaching support for this school.</p><p>Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>In March of this year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for schools. </p><p>Schools were advised that this appeal would consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017.  An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal on this basis were asked to do so by March 31st 2017.  These appeals have been processed and this appeal process has now concluded. </p><p>A second process has been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p><p>Schools who qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Schools were also advised that it acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>The NCSE has now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>Should a school consider they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, they may request such a review at: </p><p>Finally, with regards to mainstream teaching posts, the criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on my Departments website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the independent Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area. </p>  <p>  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board meets three times per year.  The third and final meeting for the 2017/18 school year took place in October, 2017.  There is no record of Milltown Nagle Rice School having submitted an application to the appeal board.</p>  <p>  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  In April 2015 the school referred to moved into a new school building provided by my Department to cater for a long term projected mainstream staffing compliment of Principal plus 12 mainstream teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, in late 2016, the school referred to submitted an application for additional accommodation due to increases in pupil enrolments.  The application was processed, having regard to the demographic information available for the school planning area within which the school in question is located, and it was determined that there was sufficient capacity within the school planning area to meet the demand for primary school places.  In that regard the application was not approved.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing updated demographic data nationally, including the school planning area within which the school referred to is located.  This review will advise whether any additional demographic demand is required.  In that context the application from the school referred to will be reconsidered and the school authorities will be advised if there is any change in the position.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is a separate independent statutory body whose functions include planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required.  This includes the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p>  <p>  Students enrolling in special lasses must have a report from a relevant professional or team of cprofessionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p>  <p>  -  S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special class in question, and</p>  <p>  -  S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p>  <p>  170 new special classes have been opened for the 2017/18 school year and the NCSE continues to establish additional special classes as required.  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 130% from 548 in 2011 to 1,302 for the 2017/18 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools may apply to the NCSE to open a special class where a need has been identified in their area i.e. a number of students have professional reports indicating they require the support of a special class.</p>  <p>  SENOs may also approach a school directly where they are aware that a special class is or will be required in the near future.  SENOs consult with other education parties (e.g. NEPS and Inspectorate) when planning to set up a special class. </p>  <p>  Before approaching schools to request the establishment of a special class, SENOs take into account both present and future potential needs within the area and must be satisfied that the class is sustainable and appropriately located. </p>  <p>  Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement, including special class placement, should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.  The NCSE&rsquo;s SENO responsibility includes planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, including supporting children and parents in identifying school placement options and resource needs.  Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs.  Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, including those in the area to which the Deputy refers are available on www.ncse.ie  in county order, and with new classes identified.</p>  <p>   As the matter referred to by the Deputy involves a special class placement for an individual child, I have arranged for the NCSE to respond directly to the Deputy on the issue.</p></reply>

Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 will be recruited in 2017-2018.  The figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017 so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced.  All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete.  We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some schools have experienced difficulty in recruiting adequately qualified teachers in particular subjects, including Irish, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing this issue.  My Department has been made aware of the case of the school referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subjects.  These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017.  This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers.</p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short term vacancies.  My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council.  My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at post primary level to a maximum of 300 hours in a school year and at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; which, while focussing on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, outlined the work which will be required to establish a long term model of post-primary teacher supply.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are difficulties in developing a reliable model of teacher supply at second level and this was recognised in the work of the Teaching Council as teaching is competing with many other sectors for graduates in areas like Maths, Science, and Irish.  The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter. </p>  <p>  I am currently reviewing with my Department other potential initiatives on teacher supply.  In that context my Department intends engaging with the various stakeholders, including school management bodies and the HEA, regarding further actions in this area.</p></reply>

Access to a Public Sector Pension Scheme is determined by a number of factors, which includes in the case of part time workers, that there is a whole time pensionable comparator in the sector.   </p>  <p>  It is a matter for each ETB to determine whether a person is eligible to become a member of the relevant superannuation scheme in accordance within the relevant rules and regulations.</p>  <p>  Under Section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act, 2009, as amended, a person is liable to pay the pensions-related deduction if he or she is a public servant on or after the 1 March 2009 and is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under the scheme or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, an individual who is not entitled to a pension benefit from his/her employment may be liable to pay the pension related deduction (PRD) in certain other circumstances, including if he/she receives a payment in lieu of membership of a public service pension scheme.  In that regard, for example, a non-pensionable gratuity is payable to certain staff of educational training boards whose service is not reckonable for superannuation purposes.</p>  <p>  The PRD forms part of a wider set of financial emergency measures affecting public service pay and pensions which were directed at securing a stabilisation in the public finances.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.</p>  <p>  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. </p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718500.</p>  <p>  In relation to school places my Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department&rsquo;s own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of the additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity with a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school(s).</p>  <p>  The nationwide demographic exercises of all school planning areas nationwide at primary and post-primary level, which will determine where additional school accommodation will be needed in the future, is ongoing.

Over 600,000 people, mostly members of the Rohingya community, have now fled from Myanmar and are facing extremely challenging circumstances in Bangladesh.  This Government has consistently expressed our concern about the violence which has taken place in Northern Rakhine State, and the ensuing humanitarian crisis which has developed in neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>  <p>  Ireland has stressed the need for a full restoration of humanitarian aid and media access to Rakhine State, and an investigation into the allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  Ireland has also called upon the Government of Myanmar to implement the recommendations of the Annan-led Advisory Commission on Rakhine State in full.</p>  <p>  We are fully engaged in the EU&rsquo;s efforts to engage Myanmar on this issue, and our position is reflected in Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 October.  I raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in my own statement on this issue on 15 September, and in my statement to the UN General Assembly on 23 September.  My officials are also engaged in deliberations in UN fora on this issue, most recently by co-sponsoring a resolution on the situation in Myanmar [which is expected to be adopted on 16 November by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly]. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to contributing to international efforts to alleviate the immediate needs of the refugees that have entered Bangladesh, which now number over 600,000.  To this end, at the Pledging Conference for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis in Geneva on 23 October we pledged &euro;2m in direct support.  &euro;1m has already disbursed to civil society partners and international organisations that are providing services to vulnerable refugees in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar and two experts have been deployed via the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps.  The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, to which Ireland contributes funding, have also scaled up their operations in Bangladesh and in Myanmar.  My Department will continue to closely monitor the humanitarian situation as it unfolds.</p>  <p>  While the level of violence has decreased in recent weeks, the situation on the ground has not significantly improved.  The ASEM Foreign Minister&rsquo;s Meeting will take place in Nay Pyi Taw next week and will present an important opportunity for Ireland and the EU to engage with the Government of Myanmar on this issue.</p></reply>

This priority is fully reflected in the European Commission Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles paper on Ireland/Northern Ireland of 7 September.  It makes clear that it is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to propose workable solutions and take the policy decisions required to deliver on the shared objective of avoiding the border.  The Government fully supports this paper.</p>  <p>  I welcome the UK&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining the Common Travel area and avoiding &ldquo;any physical infrastructure at the border&rdquo;.  While I acknowledge the sincerity of this commitment, the EU has made it clear that it needs to be backed up with workable solutions that consider fully the complexities presented by the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union.</p>  <p>  In committing to concrete plans to avoid a hard border, the UK must also take account of and comprehensively address the risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Internal Market and Customs Union. </p>  <p>  The Government remains of the view that any solution to the border issue will, first and foremost, need to be political.  Flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border which not only address the economic challenges but also take account of the societal challenges and how important the current invisible border is for sustaining the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  This is about ensuring that people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods are protected and that communities and businesses in the border region are given every opportunity to develop and prosper.</p>  <p>  Planning is ongoing across Government to prepare for all possible scenarios, including in the event of no deal being reached, but we are not at the cliff edge yet.  The focus remains on working with our EU partners and the UK in seeking an orderly withdrawal, that protects the peace process, avoids a hard border, maintains the Common Travel Area and secures a transitional arrangement that leads to the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK.  This will be a long and complex process and an outcome is far from determined.  The Government remains hopeful that the sufficient progress required can be made in the coming weeks before the next meeting of the European Council on 14-15 December that could enable it to decide to move onto phase 2 and the parallel discussions on a framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK and on transitional arrangements.  This will require hard work, and political will. </p></reply>

It was clear well in advance that it would not be possible for the EU&rsquo;s Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to recommend that sufficient progress has been made.</p>  <p>  I welcome the call by the European Council for work in the negotiations to continue, and its commitment to reassess progress at its next meeting in December.  The EU has been clear on what is expected from the UK in phase 1 and now is the time for the UK to make the necessary commitments across all three exit issues. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the European Council also agreed to begin internal preparatory discussions on priorities for the future framework for the EU-UK future relationship, and for transitional arrangements.  The aim of such discussions, which began at official level last week, is to ensure that the EU is ready to begin phase 2 negotiations with the UK as soon has sufficient progress has been recorded.  This should be seen not just as prudent preparation but as a signal of goodwill.</p>  <p>  There was some progress on citizens&rsquo; rights during the negotiating round of 9/10 November.  More work needs to be done but we note the Task Force&rsquo;s view that the UK has provided useful clarifications that are a good basis for further work.  There is however significantly more work to be done on the issue of the financial settlement, where more detail is needed from the UK as to how it will honour its commitments, as promised by the Prime Minister in her Florence speech in September.</p>  <p>  On the Irish specific issues, the support of our EU partners for finding solutions to the unique challenges facing the island of Ireland has been strong and consistent throughout this process.  The basis of the EU&rsquo;s position remains as set out in the European Council Guidelines of 29 April and the Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles paper of 7 September.  The EU&rsquo;s approach to this week&rsquo;s round of negotiations has not departed from this, but has built upon it. </p>  <p>  Overall, more needs to be done before the December European Council.  We do not underestimate the challenges ahead but the Government remains hopeful that, with hard work and political will, sufficient progress can be made in the intervening period.  I believe that this is the shared view of all EU-27 Member States and I also believe, based on my own discussions and on reports from our Missions, that the British Government is increasingly aware of the steps it needs to take. </p></reply>

The other parties represented in the Assembly - which have shown considerable patience - also have a critical role to play.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that, after several phases of negotiations in different formats, we still do not have an agreement to form an Executive.  The issues under discussion &ndash; particularly those on language and culture &ndash; go to the heart of the divisions in society in Northern Ireland and agreement on them was always going to be challenging.  </p>  <p>  I have always believed that it remains possible to reach an honourable compromise which ensures implementation of previous agreements and reflects the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement and power-sharing itself - partnership, equality and mutual respect.  It remains my conviction that this is achievable.</p>  <p>  I maintain regular engagement on behalf of the Government with civic society across all communities and regions in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach and other Government Ministers also visits Northern Ireland on a regular basis.  There is in addition extensive engagement, North and South, through the Government&rsquo;s ongoing All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit. </p>  <p>  All of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with civic society in Northern Ireland, confirms our view that there is an urgent need and demand for the effective operation of the power-sharing Executive and Assembly, to deliver representative and accountable devolved Government, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement and as mandated by the public in the last Assembly election.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a Budget Bill for Northern Ireland at Westminster this week is a significant development for the political process in Northern Ireland, founded on the Good Friday Agreement.  A budget for Northern Ireland is a matter that should be considered and decided on by the power-sharing Executive and Assembly. </p>  <p>  As there is no Executive in place at present, the necessary budgetary decisions cannot be made by the devolved institutions.  In the meantime, a statutory basis for the continued funding of public services in Northern Ireland is required. </p>  <p>  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has confirmed that the Budget Bill reflects the advice of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and has not been subject to political decision-making outside of Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I would acknowledge that this step has been taken by the British Government with reluctance and at the latest possible stage in order to seek to preserve the role of the devolved institutions to decide on budgetary and other matters within their responsibility when they are operating again.</p>  <p>  It is important to clearly affirm that the Good Friday Agreement remains the indispensable framework for relationships within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland and between the UK and Ireland.  The Government has confirmed that this week, as has the British Government.</p>  <p>  In the event that the devolved institutions cannot function, it is the responsibility of the British and Irish Governments to ensure that the North/South and East-West institutions of the Agreement can continue to operate effectively and in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently affirmed our unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and determination, as a co-guarantor of the Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  The Taoiseach and I continue to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to give full effect to that commitment.</p></reply>

The conflict has entered its third year, the political process has stalled and the fighting is having devastating consequences for civilians.  This conflict has been characterised by allegations of violations of human rights, massive starvation and disease, and infringements of international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  Seven million Yemenis are on the brink of famine, including approximately two million severely malnourished children.  In addition, Yemen has experienced a surge in cholera cases since April, with almost one million suspected cases and over two thousand associated deaths according to the World Health Organization.</p>  <p>  The only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Ireland is working, including though the EU and UN, to support efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict, to investigate and prosecute alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and to support the humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.  I welcome the Special Envoy&rsquo;s announcement following his meeting with senior Yemeni and Saudi officials last month, of the steps that are currently being explored.  These include: reinstating the cessation of hostilities, confidence building measures on the humanitarian side, and the return to the negotiating table.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers last discussed the situation in Yemen at the Foreign Affairs Council in April.  The Council called on the parties to start negotiating a peace agreement, and committed to increasing its engagement with Yemen once a political solution to the conflict is agreed.  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has also contributed over &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance from our Aid Programme since 2015.  This includes our commitment made in April to provide &euro;4 million to the UN Humanitarian Fund for Yemen, which provides rapid and flexible funding to NGOs and UN agencies for health, water and sanitation, and nutrition. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also providing &euro;20 million annually for 2016-2018 to the UN World Food Programme which is active in providing food assistance in Yemen.  In addition, Ireland is the 8th largest contributor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $84.8 million to Yemen since 2015. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also working through the UN system to address the human rights situation in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen.  This Resolution established a group of international experts to examine allegations of human rights violations of human rights during the conflict, and to report back to the UN Human Rights Council next year.  This investigation is an important step towards accountability in Yemen, and will help establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law and improved humanitarian access going forward. </p></reply>

Over 145 million people in 39 countries around the world are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.  The UN estimates that a record $24.1 billion is needed this year to respond effectively to these needs. </p>  <p>  The UN has identified the emergencies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as particularly complex crises in conflict situations which have resulted in significant displacement, food insecurity, rising malnutrition levels and serious concerns for the protection of civilians.  Coordinated responses from the international community are required in order to deal effectively with complex crises such as these.</p>  <p>  Despite a huge gap between the total requirements of the UN-coordinated appeals and the funding received, the international community&rsquo;s coordinated response can and is working.  For example, the international community provided more than $2.4 billion in humanitarian support this year to address the four famines then threatening more than 20 million people across South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen.  While a severe threat remains, the relief efforts coordinated by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) saved lives and alleviated imminent famine.  Ireland provided &euro;2.9 million in core funding this year to OCHA. Such funding not only supports OCHA&rsquo;s core function of coordination of humanitarian response, but enables it to manage a number of UN humanitarian pooled fund mechanisms including the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).  Ireland is a strong supporter of this mechanism, which enables the quick provision of funding to humanitarian responders whenever and wherever crises hit.  Ireland is the sixth largest donor to the CERF in 2017.</p>  <p>  To respond effectively and in a timely manner to the unprecedented level of demands facing the international community, Ireland provided more than &euro;194 million for humanitarian assistance in 2016.  Our assistance is focused on where needs are greatest, providing support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations.  We remain committed to responding in a timely and effective manner to the most severe humanitarian crises and emergencies, in particular to protracted and forgotten crises.  However, we recognise that the provision of humanitarian aid alone is not the answer.  Humanitarian need will continue to rise unless durable solutions are found to the conflicts driving the great majority of humanitarian crises.  Ireland will focus our efforts on supporting the international system to find peaceful political solutions to war and violence.  At the same time, we will continue to work to ensure faster and more effective delivery of humanitarian aid.</p></reply>

Conflict and violence, together with the impact of climate change, lead to loss of livelihoods and acute hunger, and drive massive population displacements and humanitarian needs across the region.  Ethnic violence, grave human rights abuses and the recruitment of child soldiers are a feature of many of the conflicts in the region.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU and UN partners, will continue to support conflict resolution in South Sudan.  This conflict has now taken on an increasingly ethnic dimension and widespread human rights abuses are carried out by all parties.  We fully support the efforts underway, led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, to revitalise the peace process and the implementation of the 2015 peace agreement.</p>  <p>  The overall security situation is Somalia remains extremely fragile, and Al-Shabaab&rsquo;s insurgency continues to threaten the stability of the country.  The EU is providing considerable support for AMISOM, the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, and is supporting highly effective capacity building operations focused on maritime security and military training, as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance to the Horn of Africa region, which amounts to &euro;138 million over the 2012-2017 period, is having a positive impact.  We are working through a range of UN, NGO and Red Cross partners providing shelter and protection to displaced populations, providing emergency food assistance and livelihoods support, treating acute malnutrition, and providing emergency services in water and sanitation, education and healthcare to vulnerable communities.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant amounts of longer-term development assistance in the Horn of Africa.  For example, this year Irish Aid&rsquo;s development assistance programme in Ethiopia is providing &euro;29 million to support the poorest people in the country through social protection, agriculture, health, nutrition and programmes.  Irish Aid also supports the development work of missionary and civil society organisations across the region.</p>  <p>  Together with our EU and UN partners, and through our Embassies on the ground, we will continue to closely monitor crises across the Horn of Africa, support political efforts to resolve conflicts, end ethnic violence and human rights abuses, and target our overseas assistance to communities most in need.  </p></reply>

At the United Nations General Assembly Ireland consistently condemns all forms of persecution, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief.  We also raise our concerns at the Universal Periodic Review, (UPR) a unique peer mechanism of the Human Rights Council under which the human rights records of all UN Member States are reviewed.  The current round of UPR is taking place from 6 to 17 November.</p>  <p>  In September at the 36th session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland strongly condemned all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.</p>  <p>  Ireland consistently supports the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the UN, most recently at the current UN General Assembly in November 2017 and during the 34th session of the Human Rights Council in March 2017.  The EU is a strong supporter of the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, an independent expert appointed by the UN Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  During the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development and adoption of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief.  The Guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy and reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s determination to promote freedom of religion or belief as a right to be exercised by everyone everywhere.  </p>  <p>  In 2015 Ireland secured the inclusion of a reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.  In May 2016, on the basis of a European Parliament resolution, the EU established the role of Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion and belief outside the EU.  The mandate aims to address the growing restrictions on religious freedom internationally.  In May 2017, the Commission extended the mandate of the special envoy for an additional year. </p>  <p>  The human rights situation in Myanmar has received increased attention in multilateral for a in recent months following the most recent outbreak of violence in Rakhine State, which has led to credible allegations of human rights abuses by the Myanmar security forces. </p>  <p>  The EU has led an annual resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar at Human Rights Council, most recently in March 2017, which provides a basis for the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar, Ms. Yanghee Lee, who regularly reports to the Council.  This year&rsquo;s resolution led to the establishment of a UN Fact Finding Mission to carry out an investigation into alleged human rights violations by the security forces in Rakhine State. </p>  <p>  The current situation in Rakhine State was also the subject of a Presidential Statement by the UN Security Council on 6 November, while the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the situation in Myanmar [on 14 November] which was co-sponsored by Ireland and which raised concerns about the recent allegations of human rights abuses.</p>  <p>  In addition to engaging in multilateral fora, the EU, including Ireland, is active in raising our concerns about the human rights situation in Myanmar in bilateral contacts with Myanmar.  The upcoming ASEM Foreign Ministers Meeting on 20-21 November in Nay Pyi Taw presents a further opportunity in this context. </p>  <p>  An EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue also takes place on a regular basis, and is expected to next take place in early 2018.</p></reply>

The government has only partial control of the Libyan territory, and, in the vacuum of state authority, armed groups have been responsible for systematic human rights violations.  Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans will require restoration of political stability and an end to lawlessness, through the formation of a functioning government and a return to order throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I welcome the appointment of Ghassan Salam&eacute; as UN Special Representative and Head of the UN Support Mission in Libya, and I support his efforts to bring new momentum to the UN-led dialogue.  UNSR Salam&eacute; briefed EU Foreign Ministers on his efforts when we met in New York In September.</p>  <p>  The EU has repeatedly called for all parties to end the conflict and give their support to the UN-led negotiations process, and encourages inclusive and constructive dialogue among the parties.  The EU has also addressed the serious humanitarian consequences of the conflict and its appalling impact on the Libyan people.</p>  <p>  The Gaddafi era has left Libya a legacy of weak state institutions, and the years since then have seen a political and security vacuum.  Building stable and inclusive political institutions in Libya will therefore be a slow and difficult process, and will require a sustained effort by all Libyans.  The international community stands ready to support this. </p>  <p>  I reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s full support for an inclusive, Libyan-led political solution.  I believe that such a political agreement achieved through dialogue is the best hope for restoring effective governance, and law and order to Libya.

My Department provides direct assistance in many cases, through consular visits and practical advice and assistance to individual detainees, and also works indirectly to support Irish prisoners through our partnership with the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas (ICPO), which receives funding from our Emigrant Support programme, and which provides a range of supports for Irish men and women imprisoned around the world.</p>  <p>  Support and assistance in all such cases is provided in a non-judgemental way, irrespective of the offence for which the citizen has been accused or convicted.  </p>  <p>  At any one time there are approximately 1,200 Irish Citizens in prisons overseas, including both those on remand and those who have been through a trial process and are serving sentences.  </p>  <p>  There are cases where Irish citizens choose not to exercise their right to be in contact with their local Embassy or Consulate.  There are also cases, unfortunately, where some authorities in third countries fail to notify our consular officials of the detention of our citizens.  Consequently, we are not able to say definitively the number of Irish persons imprisoned in any country or region at any precise moment.  </p>  <p>  The Department and/or the ICPO are currently aware of two Irish Citizens who are in prisons in countries in the Middle East region.</p>  <p>  I would also note in this context that there are severe limitations under international law to what the Irish Government can do in the case of dual nationals imprisoned abroad, particularly if they are detained in the country of their other citizenship.  In these circumstances my Department cannot demand consular access.</p>  <p>  If the deputy is concerned about any specific case, I would be happy to look into it if he wishes to pass on the details to my office.</p></reply>

These are: protecting the peace process, no hard border, maintaining the Common Travel Area, securing an effective transitional arrangement leading to the closest possible trading relationship with the UK, and working for the future of the European Union itself.</p>  <p>  The border is a complex issue, and therefore flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border which not only address the economic challenges but also take account of the societal challenges and how important the current invisible border is for sustaining the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  This is about ensuing that people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods are protected and that communities and businesses in the border region are given every opportunity to develop and prosper.  Any solution must respect the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them and must not anticipate the outcome of the wider discussions on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  It is therefore the Government&rsquo;s view that the UK staying in the Customs Union and Single Market, or the closest possible arrangement to that, would be the best solution to avoid a hard border on the island.  Failing that, Northern Ireland should continue to enjoy the benefits of the Customs Union and the Single Market, of course with all the rights and obligations that would come with that.  If the UK continues to rule out this option, the solutions that it offers must be concrete and workable and must achieve the shared objective of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  Now is the time for the UK to provide strong political assurances and tangible commitments, which must also take account of and comprehensively address the risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Internal Market and Customs Union. </p>  <p>  My officials and I will continue to work very closely with Michel Barnier and his team to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s positions continue to be fully reflected in the negotiations.  This is a long process and the outcome is far from determined but I remain hopeful that, with hard work and political will, progress can be made in the coming weeks before the next meeting of the European Council on 14-15 December.  </p></reply>

In this capacity, I am working closely with colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  Aside from its wider co-ordination responsibilities, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has lead responsibility for planning for, preparing positions on, and following the EU-UK negotiations.  This requires research on and analysis of very many legal, institutional, and political issues.  Within my Department, this work is led by the European Union Division in co-operation with the Ireland and United Kingdom and Americas Division, the Legal Division, the Political Division and the Trade Division.  Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and our Embassies in all Member States, send in a constant stream of reports describing and analysing the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our partners.</p>  <p>  My Department is also analysing the possible impact of Brexit on policy areas within its remit, notably the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU&rsquo;s policy on international development.</p>  <p>  We have already seen the implications that Brexit has had for our consular and passport services.  There has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  In this regard, the Passport Service in Dublin, Cork and London as well as Consular Division have recruited a number of additional temporary and fulltime officers to meet increased Passport and Foreign Birth Registration demands including increased demand as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the European Commission and European Parliament Offices here in Dublin and with civil society organisations including the Institute for International and European Affairs and European Movement Ireland.  With funding from this Department, the IIEA is undertaking research on the future shape of the EU and the new strategic alliances that Ireland will need to develop within the EU after Brexit.  The analysis will also consider the macro-economic effects of Brexit and the EU institutional implications of Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  This work will build on the extensive analysis being undertaken by a range of organisations, both in Ireland and further afield, and will be presented in a series of public research papers over the coming months and years.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding all this ongoing analysis, preparation and contingency planning, the Government is already actively responding to the implications of Brexit and putting measures in place to mitigate the adverse effects for Ireland.  Significant measures were announced in Budget 2018 including increased funding for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which will, among other things, support the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025 to help our exporters find new markets and diversity their exports. </p>  <p>  We are not under any illusions about the complexity of Brexit and the EU-UK negotiations but the Government remains hopeful that progress can be made in the negotiations in the coming weeks so that a decision can be taken by European Council at its meeting in December to allow for parallel phase 2 discussions on future relationship and possible transitional arrangements to begin.  Ireland will continue to work closely with the Commission Task Force to advance these issues in the negotiations with the UK. </p></reply>

Both countries are active participants in the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership Initiative which provides a framework for cooperation with the six countries of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region.  Both Georgia and Ukraine worked with the EU to develop concrete proposals for the period up to 2020, captured in the document &ldquo;Eastern Partnership - 20 Deliverables for 2020" which will be adopted at the Eastern Partnership Summit on 24 November.  The EU has also ratified Association Agreements with Georgia and Ukraine which aim to promote political association and economic integration with the Union based on shared values.</p>  <p>  The EU remains fully committed to assisting Ukraine in delivering its political and economic reform programme and has provided unprecedented levels of support to underpin the Government&rsquo;s efforts.  This support includes loans, budget support, humanitarian aid, technical assistance and trade preferences.  In addition, the EU is playing a key role in helping to reform the civilian security sector through its Advisory Mission to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  1 September 2017 marked an important milestone in relations with Ukraine when the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement legally entered into force.  The fully ratified Agreement will allow the EU to further strengthen political and economic ties with Ukraine.  The provisional application of the trade part of the Agreement since last year has already seen a welcome increase of 25% in two way trade and this is expected to continue in the coming years. </p>  <p>  The most recent EU-Ukraine Summit took place in Kyiv on 13 July and provided an opportunity to assess progress on the reforms, in particular the fight against corruption.   </p>  <p>  As regards the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the EU continues to fully support ongoing efforts to secure implementation of the Minsk peace agreements within the framework of the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group (OSCE, Russia and Ukraine) and the Normandy Format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine).  The Minsk accords offer the only basis for a political resolution to the conflict and the European Union will continue to push for their full implementation.   </p>  <p>  As with Ukraine, the EU remains committed to its political association and economic integration with Georgia and the successful implementation of the Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area.  The EU has praised Georgia's reform efforts as well as underlining the need to ensure sustainability of the reforms.  The recently revised EU-Georgia Association Agenda provides a practical framework and guidance for the implementation of priorities for joint work until 2020, based on the Association Agreement.  Justice sector reform is one of the key priorities.  The EU also fully supports Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.  The appointment of a new EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia, as well as the EU Monitoring Mission are visible and substantial signs of the EU's commitment to helping Georgia address its security challenges. </p></reply>

Section 9 lays down the fundamental principle on which the Bill is founded, that information in electronic form cannot be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability merely on the basis that it is in electronic form.  A number of areas of our laws to which it is proposed the Bill will not initially apply are outlined in section 10.  Laws governing the registration of immovable property, wills, trusts and enduring powers of attorney are excluded because it is felt the technology and systems are not yet at a stage where they could cope with the execution of such transactions electronically.  These areas are excluded only for the time being.  Once it is appropriate to extend the legislation to these areas, the Minister of the day has the power to make regulations to extend the application of the legislation to them.&quot;</p><p>It is clear, therefore, that exclusions from the scope of the Act are not intended to be permanent.  However, any extension of the Act to excluded areas or subjects must have regard to the need for safeguards against fraud and impersonation.  This applies in particular to situations in which the signature of witnesses is currently required. </p><p>In light of the foregoing, it is clear that any future extension of the scope of the Electronic Commerce Act will necessitate a comprehensive consultation process involving all relevant stakeholders.  Responsibility for launching such a process lies, in the first instance, with the relevant Minister and Department, i.e. the Minister and Department of Communications, Climate Act and Environment as the holders of responsibility for the relevant area of the former Minister and Department for Public Enterprise.  I can, of course, confirm that my Department is willing to engage in any such consultations.  I would also encourage and expect that other important statutory and non-statutory stakeholders, including the Courts Service and the legal and business communities, to contribute to such a consultation process.</p></reply>

It is important to have the views of a broad range of interests represented on the panel.  At the same time, it is necessary to strike a balance and not allow this panel to expand to the point where the numbers hamper progress being made.  The membership of this panel is made up of the following organisations:</p><p>- Sports Coalition </p><p>- National Association of Regional Game Councils </p><p>- Target Shooting Ireland</p><p>- National Rifle Association of Ireland</p><p>- Irish Sports Council</p><p>- National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service </p><p>- Wild Deer Association</p><p>- Irish Deer Society</p><p>- Irish Clay Pigeon Shooting Association</p><p>- Countryside Alliance</p><p>- Irish Farmers' Association</p><p>- National Association of Sporting Rifle and Pistol Clubs</p><p>- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</p><p>Officials from my Department met with the organisation in question in July of this year to discuss matters of concern to them, including matters relevant to firearms dealers.  The Department advised that membership of the FCP was at maximum capacity and that there was little benefit to be gained from duplicating representatives of firearms dealers on the group.  In addition, other sectors might well respond by also seeking increased representation, making the whole process unmanageable. In this regard it should be noted there are currently 4 firearms dealers on the group.</p></reply>

It is now the main regulation governing the labelling of foods.  It introduced a requirement to provide nutrition labelling on pre-packaged foods - that is a declaration of the energy value, and the amounts of fat, saturates, carbohydrate, sugars, protein and salt contained in such products.</p>  <p>  The regulation also provides that EU Member States can recommend the use within their own territory of a voluntary scheme which provides for additional forms of expression or presentation of nutrition information for specified nutrients, once the proposed scheme meets certain criteria.  </p>  <p>  The French Nutri-Score system is one such voluntary national scheme.  Given that it is a voluntary scheme, there is no obligation that products from Ireland which are sent to France should conform to this scheme.  Moreover, it is a requirement of the FIC Regulation that the application of such a scheme must not create obstacles to the free movement of goods within the EU.  The UK has introduced a similar voluntary scheme - the Colour Codes Guideline Daily Amount (GGDA).  Any demand for products made in Ireland to be labelled in accordance with such schemes can only arise from business specifications which form an integral part of commerce.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) that it has been reported in the media that voluntary schemes have not met with universal acceptance by the food industry within the individual Member States where they were introduced.</p>  <p>  This Government's National Obesity Policy Action Plan, A Healthy Weight for Ireland 2016-2025 contains policy action 2.3, "Review EU consumer information labelling of food products and with a view to its application in the Irish market".  The Department&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Unit is leading on this action plan and will consider this in due course.</p>  <p>  The application of the FIC rules is usually discussed within an expert working group convened by the European Commission.  I have been advised by the FSAI that any complaints about the details or operation of any voluntary scheme are normally dealt with on a bilateral basis by the European Commission and the relevant Member State.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government and Sl&aacute;intecare commit to shifting the model of Irish healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible service that can deliver better patient care closer to home in communities across the country, including in rural and disadvantaged urban areas.  As part of this process, Budget 2018 allocated a further &euro;25 million to the funding for primary care services.</p>  <p>  In the context of the publication by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of the Public Service Pay and Pension Bill 2017, I announced my intention to undertake a process of engagement with the representative bodies of contracted health professionals in 2018.  This process will aim to establish a new multi-annual approach to fees, in return for service improvement and contractual reform in line with Government priorities for the health service.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring the continued sustainability of general practice in rural communities.  An enhanced supports package for rural General Practitioners was introduced in May 2016.  The new Rural Practice Support Framework includes improved qualifying criteria for rural support and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216 to &euro;20,000 per annum.  Over 300 General Practitioners now benefit from rural practice supports under this Framework, a significant increase on the 167 General Practitioners who received the Rural Practice Allowance prior to the introduction of the new measures.</p>  <p>  General Practitioners play an important role in the primary care system.  The next phase of negotiations on a new GMS contract with the representatives of General Practitioners is currently underway.  There is a clear need to modernise the GMS contract and ensure that General Practice is a viable and rewarding career for medical graduates.  I am confident that with the continued constructive engagement of the parties involved, progress on this important issue can be made in the period ahead. </p></reply>

He is empowered to enter a sea-fishing boat in the Register or remove it from the Register </p><p>Capacity is not an asset owned by the Department or by the Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats.  It is a privately owned tradable asset that, with certain exceptions, may be sold, traded or realised as a financial asset on the tonnage market. </p><p>Under EU law and National policy, the entry of new capacity into the fleet must be compensated by the previous withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity whereby licence applicants provide replacement capacity at a ratio of 1:1 under fleet segmentation rules.</p><p>In order for capacity to be traded or transferred to a replacement vessel, it must be off-register from a de-registered vessel.  Off-register capacity is traded by individuals and companies by way of private contract and the Licensing Authority/Registrar General only has an approval role in this regard.  Vessels which are out of commission short-term due to essential maintenance and repairs or due to illness of persons are not required to be de-registered and the capacity of such vessels does not automatically become off-register and is not tradable or transferrable.  For the capacity of such vessels to become tradable or transferrable, the only criterion that applies is that vessels must be de-registered and their capacity becomes off-register.  Consequently the Registrar General does not maintain or hold information or statistical data on the length of time and reason why boats are out of commission.  </p><p>The following table contains statistical information on the fleet capacity levels for the years 2007 to 2014. <table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Fleet Capacity (i.e. On-Register) 31 December</div></th><th><div>No. Vessels (Excluding Aquaculture Vessels)</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>66,620 GT<br /><br />196,888 kW</div></td><td><div>1,903</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>65,076 GT181,030 KW</div></td><td><div>1,951</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>63,858 GT181,088 KW</div></td><td><div>2,016</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>64,581 GT185,392 KW</div></td><td><div>2,046</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>59,566 GT182,325 KW</div></td><td><div>2,071</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>60,342 GT186,544 KW</div></td><td><div>2,113</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>59,515 GT181,641 KW</div></td><td><div>2,050</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>58,908 GT179,659 KW</div></td><td><div>2,014</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

However in exceptional circumstances, landscape features may be removed only if a replacement hedge, line of trees, drain is planted/dug in advance of the removal and is of similar length to the feature removed.  You can only replace like with like, for example if a hedge is removed a hedge must be replanted at another location on the holding and the species used must be traditional to the area and the replacement landscape feature cannot be for amenity purposes, e.g. around farmyard or driveway.</p>  <p>  Failure to adhere to this requirement may result in a cross compliance sanction being applied under Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) 7.

This has been prompted by the protracted inclement weather conditions and also market difficulties caused by currency fluctuations.

There will also be an increase permitted to the advance for Pillar II Rural Development schemes.   </p>  <p>  These payments and the payments under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, have injected over &euro;800 million into the Irish rural economy.  These payments are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance fodder purchase where necessary. </p>  <p>  Taking account of this, there are no plans at this time to establish a task force.  My Department will continue to closely monitor the situation.</p></reply>

No. 125 of 2016) establishes a point system, which will apply to the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy is detected.  It is intended that the new Statutory instrument which I intend to sign shortly will replace S.I. No. 125 of 2016 to change the make-up of the Determination Panel set up under the 2016 S.I. to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement.  This will involve the appointment of three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General, thereby completely separating the enforcement and the determination functions.  The new SI will, to the extent possible, take on board the issues of concern in relation to procedures and processes highlighted in High Court judgments on this matter.  It will also address certain minor technical and drafting issues arising in S.I. No. 125 of 2016 .</p>  <p>  Regarding the determination of a serious infringements, the S.I. (Regulation 3 of SI No. 125 of 2016) defines &ldquo;serious infringement&rdquo; as "...an infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy mentioned in Annex XXX to the Commission Regulation that is determined by the Determination Panel, on the balance of probabilities, to be serious having regard to the criteria and guidance notes referred to in Regulation 6(3)."</p>  <p>  Regulation 3 also provides that &ldquo;Commission Regulation&rdquo; means Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1962 of 28 October 2015.</p>  <p>  Regulation 6(3) referred to above provides that "The SFPA may issue guidance notes, which shall be published on its website on the internet, for the purpose of providing practical guidance in identifying the criteria, for the purpose of these Regulations, the Control Regulation and the Commission Regulation, employed in determining whether an infringement is a serious infringement."</p>  <p>  It is intended that the new SI will feature the same definitions.  As stated above, it is envisaged that it will be for the new Determination Panel established under the new SI to determine if on the balance of probabilities an infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement.  </p>  <p>  Having an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of points for all fishing vessels, Irish and non Irish, operating in our 200 mile zone is beneficial to maintaining the sustainability of fish stocks on which our seafood sector is dependant.  This system will ensure that the vast majority of our law abiding fishermen are able to compete effectively and look forward to a sustainable future in the industry. </p></reply>

This achievement has been delivered as a result of continued research, advances in animal genetics, health and nutrition, and through optimising the use of fertilisers. </p>  <p>  A range of actions are being undertaken to make Irish farming even more environmentally sustainable including through the Rural Development Programme (RDP), worth almost &euro;4 billion over seven years. Measures such as:</p>  <p>  The Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) incentivises agricultural production methods to address issues of climate change, water quality and biodiversity loss.  The scheme also supports low carbon agriculture through a range of cross-cutting measures, and promotes the delivery of targeted environmental advice and best practice at farm level.  50,000 farmers have prepared nutrient management plans and soil sampled their farms as an entry requirement to the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is directly targeted at the climate emissions of 30,000 beef farmers.  It will assist farmers in selecting robust and resource efficient suckler cow replacements thus lowering the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national herd.</p>  <p>  The knowledge transfer programmes bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. </p>  <p>  Farmers are also being assisted in the purchase of Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS) equipment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) scheme.  The use of this type of equipment is supported under the GLAS scheme.</p>  <p>  Nitrogen is now more efficiently used through improved manure management and soil fertility.  The Nitrates Action Programme helps in this regard and contains measures to protect surface waters and ground water from agricultural sources. </p>  <p>  The above are just some of the measures being undertaken, however, policy interventions must be optimised by well-informed scientific research.  In this regard my Department has invested heavily in climate change actions through our own Research Funding Programmes which of course complement Teagasc activities in this area.  It is through this continued investment in and engagement with research initiatives that the sector will continue to make progress in reducing GHGs that are associated with agricultural production. </p></reply>

We continue to monitor the situation closely and respond as appropriate to developments in order to defend the interests of Irish farmers, working in close co-operation with my Government colleagues, particularly the T&aacute;inaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Taoiseach.  Indeed, the Taoiseach raised the matter in the course of recent meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>  <p>  At political level, I have continuously raised the issue with my Member State colleagues and with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstr&ouml;m, both within the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in written form.  These efforts have been reinforced at official level through similar contacts with Member States and the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee. </p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 27 October, and I raised the matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg in October and again in Brussels on 6 November.  I have also worked very closely with a number of other Member States, most notably France, including in the production of a joint paper that was submitted to the European Commission on 26 September outlining our shared concerns.  And I wrote to Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m in early October, reiterating my concerns in relation to the tabling of the beef TRQ offer.   </p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  In this regard I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.  Against this background I will continue to build alliances with other Member states and to defend the interests of the Irish and EU beef sectors. </p></reply>

I invited contributions from members of the forum on developing these initiatives and how they could best be delivered.  I will be inviting stakeholders to a future meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee of Food Wise 2025 to present on the more important of these initiatives.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 is of course the blueprint for the development of the agri-food sector as a whole, including the tillage sector.  This document contains a number of priority actions to support the development of the tillage sector.  My own Department implements a number of these actions.</p>  <p>  For example, in order to increase the availability of native grown protein crops for inclusion in animal feeds, a protein aid scheme was introduced in 2015, as part of the implementation of the reformed CAP package in Ireland.  &euro;3 million was set aside annually for this scheme and the rate of payment in 2016 was &euro;246/ha. </p>  <p>  In July of this year in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced the Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops.  </p>  <p>  I introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme in January of this year and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  All the finance available under this scheme has been committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  There has been a very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, including tillage farmers. </p>  <p>  In addition to this support I secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan scheme for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018.  Further details will be announced in due course.  </p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II earlier this year.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  There is a significant level of interest in investments under this measure with a total number of 687 applications received. </p>  <p>  I secured an increase from 50% to 70% advance payment on 16 October last of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and Greening payments from the European Commission.  This approach was prompted by the market difficulties being experienced in several sectors including tillage arising from ongoing currency fluctuations and protracted poor weather conditions. </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the level of production, quality and viability of the Irish cereal sector.  These services include seed certification, seed testing, crop variety testing and the publication of recommended lists of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; competitive research programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for tillage producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the range of current supports, I will continue to closely engage with the tillage sector on its needs, particularly through the Tillage Stakeholders Group.</p></reply>

In this regard and as permitted under the terms of the Concession Agreement, BT has a contractual arrangement with Conduit Global Ltd. to assist in the delivery of the service.  Under the terms of the Concession contract, BT Ireland and its sub-contractor, Conduit Global, are required to comply with all employment legislation. </p>  <p>  My officials were in close contact with BT throughout the 2016 industrial relations dispute to ensure service to the public was not affected in any way.  However, operational issues, including working conditions and pay are a matter for Conduit Global and one in which I have no function.  In this regard, I understand that the company has engaged with the Workplace Relations Commission Advisory Service and the Labour Court in relation to industrial relations issues raised by staff and union representatives and that the case is currently on-going before the Labour Court.</p></reply>

While the premises referenced by the Deputy falls within an AMBER area and will be covered through the State led Intervention under the NBP, I understand that there are at least two operators (including mobile and Fixed wireless) that are capable of providing an interim solution.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team.  The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature. </p><p>As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and rollout.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

For example, the 2018 Finance Bill confirms that the existing accelerated capital allowances (ACA) scheme for energy efficient products is being extended for a further three years until 31 December 2020.  Under this provision organisations who invest in the most energy efficient equipment can deduct the full cost of the equipment from their profits in the year of purchase.  This reduces the taxable profit in year one by the full cost of the equipment and contributes to emissions reductions.  The resulting energy savings by companies in their productive activities contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emisssions.</p><p>Another initiative of benefit to businesses is EXEED (excellence in energy efficient design) which can provide advice and  support leading to certification for businesses to establish a systematic approach to design, construction, and commissioning processes for new investments and upgrades to existing assets.  This scheme has delivered impressive efficiency improvements in recent years.  Interest in the scheme is growing, including among small and medium-sized enterprises  and I am providing additional funding to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to allow EXEED to be expanded in 2018. </p><p>More information on both of these schemes is available on the SEAI website at .</p></reply>

In addition, a grant of up to &euro;5,000 is available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland towards the purchase of a new electric vehicle, as well as Vehicle Registration Tax relief up to a maximum &euro;5,000.  At present, public charging facilities are also provided free of charge to the user. </p>  <p>  The Government is very supportive of the transition of the car fleet to zero emissions technology, especially EVs.  The Deputy may be aware that my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, have jointly convened an interdepartmental Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) Task Force to consider a full suite of potential measures to expedite the deployment of low carbon technologies under a commitment outlined in the "Programme for a Partnership Government". </p>  <p>  Initial recommendations from the Task Force were submitted for consideration in advance of the budgetary process and I was delighted to announce a package of measures in Budget 2018 to promote a low-carbon electric vehicle future.  The measures include: continuing the VRT reduction for EVs and SEAI purchase grants; introducing a new grant to support home charger installations; a new toll incentive regime; a new grant to stimulate EV take-up in the Taxi /Hackney/Limousine (SPSV) sector; a Public Awareness Programme including driver experience opportunities; EV fleet trials in the public and commercial sectors; a new public procurement framework to allow public bodies to purchase EVs with reduced administrative burden; and a new Benefit in Kind (BIK) 0% rate to encourage the use of electric vehicles in industry.</p>  <p>  Minister Naughten and I have committed to working together to ensure that all new passenger cars sold in Ireland from 2030 onwards will be zero emission vehicles; demonstrating Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to decarbonise the transport sector and our economy as a whole.</p></reply>

This approach was agreed, last year, between myself and the Minister for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland at that time, Chris Hazzard.  </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to developing the necessary legislative changes, which will require Government approval in due course.  However, any changes to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 can only be progressed and ultimately enacted, in parallel with reciprocal legislative changes being introduced by the Northern Executive.</p></reply>

No definition for "ridesharing" is provided for in this Act. </p>  <p>  The current licensing regime was put in place to protect the consumer and to help ensure personal safety.  While cognisant of the need to safeguard these objectives, I am conscious that there is also a need to evolve and be open to new technologies and innovation.  </p>  <p>  In this context, I am committed to giving further consideration to this issue.  Along with my officials, I regularly engage with key stakeholders in the transport industry.  This helps to provide insights into the performance of our legislative frameworks and their impacts on the delivery of all modes of transport including SPSVs.  My Department continues to consider the issue of ride sharing, taking into account the likely impacts and risks to the travelling public associated with any change to current provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  This work is ongoing and I am more than happy to consider new proposals and workable options.</p></reply>

The Harbours Act 2015 provides the necessary primary legislative basis to facilitate the transfers of these ports to relevant local authority control.</p>  <p>  To date, two of the five Ports of Regional Significance have successfully transferred to the control of the relevant local authorities. On 30 August 2016, Wicklow Port Company transferred to the control of Wicklow County Council. On that date, the company was dissolved and all of its assets, liabilities and staff transferred to the Council. Subsequently on 2 October 2017, Drogheda Port Company was transferred under a transfer of shareholding model to Louth County Council. On that date ownership of all shares in the share capital of the company vested in Louth County Council.</p>  <p>  Work on the transfers of the three remaining port companies (D&uacute;n Laoghaire, New Ross, and Galway) is also progressing and I expect these to transfer in the coming months.</p></reply>

At all times, Tusla&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims of sexual and domestic violence are being met in the best way possible.</p>  <p>  In 2017, my Department provided Tusla with &euro;22.1 million in funding to support the provision of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services, an increase of &euro;1.5 million over 2016 funding. Additional funding has been targeted at improving access to services including measures to address waiting times and enhancing outreach services to increase equity in access to services across the country. Funding of just under &euro;4.27m has been allocated to organisations specifically providing services to sexual violence victims this year.</p>  <p>  Rape crisis centres offer counselling  and therapy to victims of sexual violence. Counselling services can experience increase in demand from time to time, creating longer waiting lists. </p>  <p>  I am aware, in this regard, that particular pressures were being experienced in the Dublin are. In order to alleviate pressures, Tusla provided additional funding of &euro;44,000 in 2017 to put Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's core services on a more sustainable footing and to resource additional counselling hours to reduce waiting lists and waiting times for services. Tusla was informed that the waiting list situation had improved as a result of the additional counselling resources provided. </p>  <p>  Arising from Budget 2018, I will shortly be issuing Tusla with its Performance Statement for 2018 in line with the provisions of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. Tusla will, in response to the Performance Statement, prepare a Business Plan for 2018 which will be submitted to me for consideration.</p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be allocated to Rape Crisis Centres will be considered by Tusla, in preparing its Business Plan, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2018, which will exceed &euro;753m.</p></reply>

The process for registering and using a verified MyGovID account proves in the online environment that the person has had their identity verified to the SAFE 2 standard. As part of the application of the SAFE 2 standard in the online environment, my Department seeks to ensure that a person&rsquo;s MyGovID account is not used by another person. This is vital to ensure that a personal data is only made available to the correct person and that data protection requirements are satisfied. This is done by employing two-factor authentication each time the person uses the account. Two-factor authentication is an industry standard mechanism for authenticating users of high-value online services. This means that, in addition to requesting a username and password (things they know), a one-time verification code is sent to the person&rsquo;s verified mobile phone (something they have) which they must also provide when logging in. As they are constantly changed, dynamically generated verification codes like this are safer to use than fixed (static) log-in information.

The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  Consequently any decisions made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation.  Scheme trustees must always act in the best interests of scheme members.</p><p>Usually the options available to members for taking benefits will be set out in the trust rules.

It sets out the order in which the liabilities must be discharged and also how they may be discharged for members.</p><p>When a scheme winds up, section 48(3)(b) provides that, notwithstanding the rules of the scheme, the trustees may discharge the liability for benefits payable for any member by one of the following &ndash;</p><p>1.  Transfer the benefits of each member into a new pension scheme;</p><p>2.  Purchase of an approved assurance policy with a company or insurance agency that sells life insurance;</p><p>3.  Transfer the benefits into another arrangement for the provision of retirement benefits (e.g. PRSA).</p><p>The Taxes Consolidation Act sets out the circumstances in which retirement benefit schemes are to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.  Section 772 sets out conditions for approval of schemes and allows for flexible options on retirement &ndash; the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) option.  I understand that the ARF option does not generally apply to Defined Benefit schemes, subject to certain exceptions .

Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice.  To be eligible for HAP, a household must have been assessed for social housing support by their relevant local authority and have been placed on that local authorities record of qualified households. Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the range of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.  </p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports has commenced. I would expect the results of this review to be available for publication in 2018.</p></reply>

In addition, the extensive central heating upgrade programme in social housing over the years 2004 to 2009, saw the installation of central heating and associated energy efficiency measures, in 27,750 such dwellings, at a cost to the exchequer of &euro;140 million.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware, my Department is currently supporting an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with some &euro;107 million in funding being provided from 2013 to end-2016. While this programme is being implemented in a number of phases, heating upgrades will be considered in future phases of the Programme.    </p>  <p>  In the meanwhile, if a local authority identifies a tenanted dwelling which requires a specific and urgent energy efficiency upgrade, especially in those dwellings which accommodate elderly people and people with disabilities, then a special case should be made to my Department to have these works funded.</p></reply>

This is an increase of 46% over the funding of &euro;1.3 billion available in 2017.</p>  <p>  There is no precise amount of capital funding notified to individual local authorities for the delivery of housing in a particular year. Authorities can avail of the funding provided through my Department's social housing capital investment programme to deliver new social housing through both new constructions projects and the acquisition of new and previously owned houses/apartments. </p>  <p>  Proposals for new social housing schemes are developed and bought forward by the local authorities and the drawdown of funding is directly linked to the advancement of delivery. </p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland (the Government's plan to tackle housing and homelessness) aims to provide 50,000 additional social housing homes in the period 2016-2021 and, overall, funding of &euro;6 billion is available to support this. Targets for delivery will be notified to individual authorities shortly and my Department will then engage with each authority in relation to the mix of delivery mechanisms to be used to ensure that targets are reached.</p></reply>
