The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years.  A key focus is the care planing review process which identifies children as they approach 16 years and a process of assessment by the child's social worker commences at that point, in conjunction with the wishes and views of the young person and their foster carer or residential key worker.  Each child's strengths and need for support is assessed across a number of areas, including whether they will continue to live with their foster carers for a number of years after reaching age 18.  The assessment also looks at life skills and capacity to live independently in the short and longer term; relationships with family, carers and significant others; emotional and behavioural development; health and overall well-being; identity and, very importantly, educational/training requirements. </p><p>  As I have previously informed the House, data on the number of young people who left care on reaching their 18th birthday had not previously been collected.  I considered this unacceptable and at my request the HSE began to collect this data in 2012 . Similar data is therefore not available for previous years. </p><p>  The HSE has indicated that in the reporting year 2012, 412 children in care turned 18.  Attention to the needs of all of these young people was paid and 300 young people were assessed as needing one or a combination of these specific aftercare services: remaining with foster carers, remaining in supported lodgings, moving to supported residential accommodation, assistance in finding private accommodation, financial help with education and training opportunities and the allocation of an aftercare key worker.  Only six young people of the 300 who were offered an aftercare service or services said they did not wish to avail of aftercare. </p><p>  The HSE advise that of the remaining 112, some young people returned to their birth families and wished to break off contact with the HSE while some young people remain living with their foster carers and they and their foster carers may decide they no longer wish to be provided with financial or other supports. </p><p>  However I have asked the HSE to provide me with greater information on this group of 112 young people.</p><p>  As I have previously informed the House, I am currently examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen the legislative provisions for young people leaving care to ensure that it meets the differing needs of individual young people in care on reaching their 18th birthday.  I recently met with experts and representatives of organisations working with young people in care or aftercare to discuss proposals in this regard.</p></reply>

In Ireland over 200<font color="#FF0000"> </font>young people participated in consultations in Cork, Dublin and Sligo as part of the process.</p><p>  The Conference was organised by my Department in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI).  It was a major opportunity to showcase the talent and innovation of Ireland&#8217;s young people and the youth sector.  Almost 100 young people were involved in supporting the Conference.  They acted as volunteers and took on roles as guest MCs and speakers, and provided inputs through Arts and Drama presentations.  Over the three days some 25 information stands showcased the work under way in youth programmes in communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The feedback about the young people's contribution has been very positive and the success of the Conference is attributable to their enthusiasm and engagement with the event.  I wish to pay tribute to them and thank them for their involvement. </p><p>  The Irish EU Youth Conference was the first conference within the Trio Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece, highlighting the theme of the social inclusion of young people.  Seven thematic areas drawn from the results of national consultations provided by 27 Member States and 10 International Non-Governmental Organisations were explored at the Conference via joint workshop sessions.  The seven thematic areas identified were:</p><p>- Employment &#8211; employment leads to inclusion</p><p>- Education &#8211; inclusive education for all young people</p><p>- Participation &#8211; equal rights and equal opportunities to participate in civic life</p><p>- Welfare &#8211; access to welfare</p><p>- Support &#8211; social and youth services for young people</p><p>- Youth organisations &#8211; youth organisations and social inclusion</p><p>- Quality &#8211; assuring quality in youth work to ensure social inclusion</p><p>  Young people and Ministry officials from the 27 Member States have jointly defined the 21 conclusions arising from the Conference.  The conclusions from this Conference will be brought forward in the current trio cycle and will inform the Structured Dialogue components of the Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies, which will ultimately inform the development of a Council Resolution on Structured Dialogue at the end of this current Presidency Trio.  This is a clear and compelling example of young people&#8217;s voices and vision directly informing youth policy.</p><p>  Further important activities under Ireland's EU Youth Presidency Programme includes the Council of the EU Youth Ministers which I will chair in Brussels on 16th May and the Round Table Meeting on the contribution of youth work to young people's development and preparedness for employment which I will convene in Ireland on the 20th and 21st June.</p></reply>

It will build on <i>Our Children - Their Lives, </i>Ireland&#8217;s first children&#8217;s strategy which was published in 2000 and it will cover the 5-year period from 2013 to 2018.  </p><p>  In keeping with my Department&#8217;s responsibilities for children and young people, the new Children and Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way which will comprehend the continuum of the life-course from infancy through to early and middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.  It will be the overarching Framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.  </p><p>  The Framework will use a model in which the lives of children and young people will be supported by three age-cohort strategies:</p><p>National Early Year&#8217;s Strategy &#8211; focusing on the under sixes</p><p>National Children&#8217;s Strategy &#8211; focusing on all up to 18 year olds</p><p>National Youth Strategy &#8211; focuses on the age range 10/12 years up to 25 years </p><p>  Each of the three strategies under the Framework will share a common set of principles, common set of themes and a common implementation structure.  </p><p>  My Department undertook a public consultation in 2012 and received 1,000 submissions.  An interim analysis of these submissions has been completed and a final report is expected by the end of this month.  A Children and Young People's consultation has also been carried out and attracted 67,000 replies.  The output from this consultation with children and young people was published last year.  There have been ongoing consultations with organisations represented on the National Children's Advisory Committee (NCAC).</p><p>  Consultations with other Government Departments are ongoing and they are expected to be completed in the coming month.  Discussions with other Departments have sought to identify concrete responses to priorities identified by children and young people and the general public in areas such as:</p><p>- health and well being</p><p>- education</p><p>-  economic security and poverty</p><p>- parenting and family support</p><p>- environment</p><p>- safety</p><p>- sports and recreation and</p><p>- media, arts and culture</p><p>    All of these consultations are feeding into the development of the Framework by my Department and will allow the Framework to be completed in the coming months.</p><p>  I anticipate that the final draft of the Framework will be presented to Government for approval later this year.</p></reply>

The UNCRC is the most widely ratified human rights treaty, enjoying almost universal ratification by nearly all Member States of the United Nations.  Ireland ratified the UNCRC in 1992. </p><p>   I have previously stated that it was my intention to sign the Third Optional Protocol on behalf of Ireland as soon as possible.  My Department is currently finalising the State's combined 3rd and 4th Reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  When the report is finalised and submitted to the UN Committee, I will consult with other  Government Departments and seek the approval of the Government to the signing of the third Optional Protocol on behalf of Ireland.  Ratification would generally take place some time after that, once the State is satisfied that the necessary legislative and administrative procedures are in place to enable full compliance.  This matter will be assessed by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and other Government Departments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600052#WRA01600"><p>I very much welcome the publication of the UNICEF's Report Card 11 titled "Child well-being in rich countries".  Indeed I was delighted to accept the invitation from UNICEF to launch this report last Wednesday.  This was an important event and it was appropriate that it took place in Dublin during Ireland's EU Presidency.  The league table represents the latest available overview of child well-being in 29 of the world's most advanced countries.</p><p>  In providing international comparisons this report further contributes to the wealth of data now emerging on children's lives and experiences.  </p><p>  Five dimensions of children's lives have been considered: material well-being; health and safety; education; behaviours and risks; and housing and environment.  The league table of child well-being is designed to measure and compare progress for children across the developed world.  Its purpose is to record the standards achieved by most advanced nations and to contribute to debate in all countries about how such standards can be achieved. </p><p>  I am happy to report that according to the &lsquo;Report Card&rsquo; Ireland is now recognised as one of the top 10 best places in the world to be a child.</p><p>  I note, in particular, the findings relating to Ireland having the highest rate of children exercising daily in the industrialised world, significant decline in children smoking and more modest declines in drinking and teenage pregnancies.  These international findings on smoking, drink and teenage pregnancies reinforce the trends highlighted in recent Irish findings published in the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; Report which was I launched last month.</p><p>  However, in launching the &lsquo;Report Card&rsquo; I did express concern over that Ireland had one of the highest proportions of 15-19 year olds not in education, employment or training &ndash; the so-called NEET&rsquo;s cohort.  These findings justify the approach I am taking as current President of the EU Council of Youth Ministers in prioritising the contribution of youth work to achieving the goals of Europe 2020 and supporting youth employment initiatives aimed at the NEET&rsquo;s cohort.</p><p>  I also welcome the report&rsquo;s focus on the importance of early intervention to child well-being.  This is a key objective of my Department and features in our work in developing Ireland first ever Early Year Strategy, our investment in area-based approaches to early intervention and child poverty, and the ongoing development of the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p><p>  I look forward to continuing to achieve further improvement in outcomes for children in Ireland and I would like to commend UNICEF on the publication of this report card.</p></reply>

In the first three months of 2013, a key development was a major consultation with relevant organisations and professions (Mental Health, Public Health, Education and the Gardai) which is informing the development of Standard Operating Procedures, including policies and procedures for working with partner agencies. </p><p>- a national inter-agency project is continuing to consider the scope for reorganising existing provision to ensure services meet the need of children and young people in the most effective way possible. </p><p>- A significant capital development project is under way which will provide additional capacity.  </p><p>  The HSE has advised me that the number of children placed in Coovagh House is capped at 3 to allow for appropriate testing of recent enhanced building security works.  Following completion of an ongoing review into capacity and demand for national services, the HSE advise that occupancy levels may increase to 4.</p></reply>

These programmes have been maintained and expanded despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure.  I believe this is an investment in our country&rsquo;s future prosperity.  It is recognised that intensive and targeted early childhood services have the potential to significantly enhance the life chances of many children.  Investment in early childhood care and education benefits not only the individual child but also the wider economy.  I believe there is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years.  Childcare services also make an important economic contribution through direct employment of staff in service delivery and through support for labour participation on the part of working parents. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which is currently being developed by my Department, will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education, including literacy and numeracy.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the 'Growing up in Ireland' study.  It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Interventions Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations.  The Government has committed an additional &euro;4.5 million to a new Area Based Response to Child Poverty which will build upon and extend the learning from the Prevention and Early Intervention initiative.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector.  This initiative, which represents a full year investment of &euro;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.   </p><p>  As shown by these developments the government is prioritising childcare and other early years services through the continuation and further increase in the resources devoted to such evidence based responses.</p></reply>

Funding of some &#8364;53.173m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  Notwithstanding the tremendous contribution of youth services, like all publicly funded services at this time, there is a challenge to find ways of maintaining and promoting outcomes at a time of reduced availability of exchequer funding.</p><p>  The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &#8364;5.393m.  Having regard to these savings requirements my Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in the determination process for the allocations, and to have particular regard to the protection of front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people. </p><p>  In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads in order to maintain services for young people.  I have met with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings.</p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and this report is expected later this year.  It is anticipated that this report will inform the provision of funding for youth programmes and services into the future.  In addition my Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.  The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, <i>inter alia</i>, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p><p>  I have requested the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department to forward details of the funding allocations for each of the past five years for each funded youth project in Dublin City and throughout the country as requested  by the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is the first plan of its kind and aims to address the serious impact of bullying on our children and young people. The publication of this plan is an important step in the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensuring a safer childhood.  To successfully tackle the underlying causes of bullying behaviour we must ensure all relevant policies and services are fully engaged with this agenda; it cannot be regarded as a standalone issue.</p><p>  Although schools have a lead role in tackling bullying the plan recognises the need to have a broader approach recognising that bullying is no longer limited to classrooms.  This means making sure that wherever young people are, they are protected by safety guidelines.  It means making sure that wherever young people are, they are supported by an anti-bullying ethos and an Anti Bullying Framework. </p><p>  In line with the Action Plan, the development of the Anti Bullying Framework is being prioritised in the context the new whole-of-government Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework.  This work is being led by my Department with a view to publication later this year.</p><p>   The Action Plan itself provides for a number of awareness raising measures including the development of an anti-bullying website to provide a single point of access to practical advice and support in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours.  I am advised that preliminary scoping work is under way in the Department of Education and Skills towards this development.  </p><p>  My Department is also working to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing.  Within this process we will explore any additional clarifications that may be required to assist schools in their response to bullying. </p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools in tackling bullying and their need for support and guidance, the National Education Welfare Board, which now comes under my Department&rsquo;s remit, has issued guidelines requiring each school to have policies to prevent or address bullying and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  </p><p>Compliance by schools with this requirement is inspected by Department of Education Inspectorate during Whole School Evaluations.</p><p>  In conclusion, my Department is committed to the fight against bullying and we will work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

These reports are published on the HSE website. The latest published report shows that there were 6,353 children in the care of the HSE in January 2013. 87.3% (5,549) of these children had a written care plan and 12.7% (804) did not, while 91.6% (5,810) of children had an allocated social worker and 8.4% (543) did not.</p><p>  The HSE has stated that it is their policy to ensure that all children in care have a Care Plan and that the Care Plan is reviewed as required by the Child Care Regulations.  The HSE has advised me that day to day exigencies of service provision, such as staff absence due to annual, maternity and sick leave, can impact on services.  The HSE further advised that there may be circumstances in which local decisions are made in regard to work planning within the context of service priorities, such as child protection workloads within an area or staff availability.  In these circumstances, it may be determined that a &lsquo;child in care review&rsquo; can be deferred for a short period.  Such a decision will be made on the basis of risk assessment and would apply to particularly stable care placements.  Special Care, High Support, Residential care and short term foster care are all prioritised for an allocated social worker.  Ongoing provision of social work to children and foster families is ensured in these circumstances.</p><p>  The HSE has also advised that where there are immediate operational difficulties in assigning one social worker to a child, social workers are assigned based on a needs assessment and prioritisation.  Some of these cases can relate to children in very stable fostering placements, provided, perhaps, by a relative.  Where a social worker is not assigned for a period, practice has been to support foster placements through the regular social work duty system where the child can contact the social worker on duty.  It is also important to note that cases are subject to ongoing review and, where appropriate, the level and nature of the support being provided to foster carers and children in care will change depending on the needs of the child.</p><p>  In relation to the recruitment of social workers, the HSE has advised me that as of 15th April, there are currently 123 vacant posts being filled.  Of this number, 27 posts are completed and candidates have commenced in post while 8 candidates are due to start in April/May 2013.  A further 39 candidates have accepted posts and are currently agreeing start dates.  In addition, 49 posts are at an early stage of the process overseen by the National Recruitment Service.</p></reply>

The Government has made a very significant commitment in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the current budgetary situation.  The universal nature of this programme is critical for childhood development by providing every child with early learning and preparation for school. </p><p>  The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  Services participating in the programme are required to promote age-appropriate activities and programmes.  The payment made to a service is for the provision of services, including preparatory and supportive work such as engagement with parents, training and organisation.</p><p>  Issues relating to workforce development, curricular support and capitation will be considered as part of Ireland's first-ever Early Years strategy, work on which is at an advanced stage.</p><p>  When the ECCE programme was introduced in January 2010, a number of transitional measures were included to make it more acceptable to the childcare sector.  One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38 week or a 50 week model.</p><p>  I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38 week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective.  The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50 week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.</p><p>  My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, services participating in the ECCE programme are now required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks.  It is not mandatory that children attend every day but, where they do not, the capitation fee is reduced accordingly.   </p><p>  The change to the 38 week model only was introduced in September 2012 and all participating services have successfully made the transition to the new arrangement.  There are no proposals to re-introduce the 50 week model.</p><p>  The ECCE programme includes a number of additional provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.</p><p>  My Department is currently having discussions with the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills with a view to providing a more integrated approach to the delivery of pre-school care and education services to children with disabilities.</p></reply>

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. </p><p>  This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The School Age Childcare programme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  In 2013, my Department expects to spend over &euro;70 million on the CCS and CETS programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.</p><p>  Eligibility for the new School Age Childcare programme is a matter for the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  Officials from the DSP and my Department are continuing to liaise and are currently considering the operational details of the programme.  As is the case with the CETS scheme, the new programme is expected to be open to both community and commercial childcare providers across the State.  Preparations are under way for the introduction of a pilot project which is expected to be launched shortly and which will assist both Departments in determining the procedures necessary for the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013.  Further information will be made available as the work progresses. </p></reply>

The Policy Framework is expected to be published in mid 2013 and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland&#8217;s first Children&#8217;s Strategy which was published in 2000.  This is relevant to the National Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is already under development and is expected to be completed and published later this year.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education, including literacy and numeracy.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the 'Growing up in Ireland' study.  It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Interventions Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources.  The major programme of institutional change which is currently under way, including the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, will also be taken into account.</p><p>  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy.   A further, focused consultation with key stakeholders in relation to the Early Years Strategy, is also proposed.</p><p>  My Department continues to provide significant  support to parents to assist them with the cost of childcare.  This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low incomes. </p><p>  The CETS<b></b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.    </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative.  This initiative, which represents an annual full year investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  </p><p>  In 2013, the total expenditure by my Department on these support programmes is expected to be in the region of  &#8364;260 million.  These programmes have been maintained and expanded despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.    </p></reply>

The visit, which was in conjunction with representing the Irish Government at official functions in India for St Patrick's Day, afforded me the opportunity to assess the position in relation to inter country adoption in India. </p><p>  During the visit myself and members of the delegation, accompanied by the Irish Ambassador to India,  spoke with senior Ministers from the Indian Government with responsibility for child welfare, including adoption, and with  Government officials and agencies involved in areas related to child welfare.  These included a very constructive meeting Dr Pati, head of the Indian state adoption agency, CARA.  I visited the Palna Orphanage from which a number of Indian children have been adopted by Irish families. </p><p>  These meetings afforded me the opportunity to clarify issues in relation to inter country adoption between Ireland and India and the requirements of the Indian authorities in that regard.  I was advised that, while India has placed a moritorium on standard inter country adoption, registration is now open with CARA for special needs cases; this includes children with intellectual or physical disabilities, siblings including twins, and over 5s.  The issue of the Indian authorities acceptance of an Irish accredited agency was also discussed and the Indian authorities were positively disposed in this matter.  It was explained that Indian currently operates inter country adoption with other Hague countries without the need for any specific administrative agreements of the type envisaged in Article 72 of the Adoption Act 2010. </p><p>  My engagement with the officials in India gave me an insight into the changing patterns in inter country adoption especially in relation to the rise in domestic adoption and the efforts being made by the Indian authorities to develop and maintain adoption procedures in the Indian sub-continent. </p><p>  I intend to meet with the Indian Adoption Group shortly to update them on my visit. </p></reply>

The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years.  The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel.  The Emergency Place of Safety Service, operates outside the greater Dublin area, whereby Gardai can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours.  This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  As part of this service Gardai have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.</p><p>  The latest available information from the HSE indicates that 494 referrals were made to the CIS and EPSS up to the end of Quarter 3 2012.

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.</p><p>  As part of the Joint Committees consultation process a number of submissions were received.  Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. </p><p>   Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues, including those pertaining to childminders, as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives.  In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I recently met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen.  I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area. These discussions will inform the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.  </p><p>  The framework is now focused on the safety and protection of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; co-operation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and finally mandating key individuals to report child abuse known to them.  The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities. </p><p>  A further reason for reviewing the policy is to ensure that the related and relevant legislation will be compatible with and will complement the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Act. </p><p>  It is my intention to submit further proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining this universal programme.  It is expected that the programme this year will cost up to &euro;175 million when all of the costs are taken into account.</p><p>  No specific cost analysis has been commissioned in relation to the provision of a second free pre-school year.  However, it is estimated that the additional costs of providing a second year would be similar to the costs incurred in providing the one year free pre-school provision.  In the region of 65,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children who are eligible, have availed of the free pre-school provision each full year since the introduction of the programme.  It is not anticipated that the participation rate in a second pre-school year would be as high as that currently experienced and on this basis it is estimated that the cost of the second year would be in the region of  &euro;150m to &euro;175m.</p><p>  While I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector the requirement for considerable additional funding in a time of financial constraints means that it is not possible to expand the programme at this time.  I am very conscious that work is continuing on improvement of quality within the pre-school year.  All of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the provision is key to good outcomes for children.  In particular, I would like to see further progress in workforce development within the sector given the demands which expansion would place on the current pool of trained staff.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered in the context of the National Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to six  years, which is being developed by my Department and expected to be completed later this year.</p></reply>

I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their  counterparts in Northern Ireland to  discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated that I would ideally like to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.</p><p>  The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years and a  National Implementation Group has been established   to oversee the progress and challenges in improving services and outcomes for young people leaving care.  The Group is comprised of representatives of funded services providers such as Focus Ireland and other advocacy organisations, as well as representatives of foster carers and other groups.  They have found  an  increasingly systematic approach across the country  to young people around age sixteen being identified through the care planning review process and a   standardised aftercare planning template. This   approach is helping the early identification of young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, and has led to good examples of inter-agency working.   There have also been some improvements in the data available although more work is required in this area and in rolling out   fully standardised financial allowances.  </p><p>  The HSE's annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million. There are currently 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE additionally  the HSE commissions aftercare services, residential and support in the community,  from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care across the country.  The HSE have advised me  that  approximately 500 young people reach the age of 18 in care every year, with 412 young people in care reaching their 18th birthday in 2012.</p><p>  At the end of December 2012 639 young people over the age of 18 years were supported financially to remain living with their foster carers. These young people  did not have to face the transition of leaving their foster carers at age 18 and for many, in addition to having access to an after care worker,  they received their key support from their foster carers.  110 young people were living in supported living arrangements and had an aftercare key worker. There were 384 young people over 21 receiving some aspect of aftercare support the remaining 1073 were between 18 and 21.  599 of the total number  were in full time education and a further  656  were in some form of education and training.</p><p>  Given the particular difficulties of some young people in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.  the Aftercare  Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care and the Department of the Environment regarding housing  to support this approach A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. </p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of an aftercare service but more work remains to be done.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people and the information provided will inform the policy development being undertaken to underpin aftercare in legislation.</p></reply>

RIA is charged with providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers, that is, adults and their children, under the Direct Provision system while their applications for asylum are processed.  I am advised that Direct Provision centres are monitored three times a year, twice by Department of Justice staff and once by an external company.  </p><p>  The revised Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children was published in July, 2011. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child welfare and safety concerns.  It sets out a number of key messages relating to the duty to protect children and support their welfare.  The scope of Children First extends beyond the reporting of suspected neglect,  abuse and welfare concerns.  It emphasises the importance of multi disciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of such concerns.  Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure better outcomes. </p><p>  The HSE has advised me that concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a children in Direct Provision are reported to the HSE Children and Family Services, in line with Children First. Referrals include welfare concerns such as a parent being hospitalised, parental illness, a child being left unsupervised by an adult or mental health concerns regarding the parent, while a smaller number would relate to child protection concerns.  </p><p>  There is a specific unit within RIA -the Child and Family Services Unit - whose role is to manage, deliver, co-ordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system. This unit also links, where necessary, directly with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I have had ongoing contact with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and that senior officials within my Department have been engaging with the HSE, all to ensure that children who residing in Direct Provision are afforded the same levels of welfare and protection that their counterparts in the wider community are afforded.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.173m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding. </p><p>  My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings.</p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and this report is expected later this year.  It is anticipated that this report will inform the provision of funding for youth programmes/services going into the future. </p><p>  In addition my Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people. </p><p>Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth services which provide youth work and non formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development.  These programmes offer young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience,  motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21<sup>st</sup>   century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&#8217;s world.  </p><p>  There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the significance of youth work in promoting young people&#8217;s development, health and well-being, enhancing their participation in education, training and employment and the potential youth work has, as part of wider strategies to respond to the challenges that arise.</p><p>  The role of research and consultations with youth sector interests and the young people themselves are central elements in my Department&#8217;s approach to the formulation of the youth policy services that are responsive to young peoples needs.   My Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth work to advance our understanding of the impact of youth services in the lives of children and young people. The study will inform a new Youth Policy Framework which is planned by my Department for later this year. The findings of the Growing Up In Ireland Study of my Department and other studies including EU studies have been significant in relation to providing information about children and young peoples experience of bullying and its impact on them. </p><p>  The Action Plan on Bullying - produced by cross-sectoral working group on which my Department and the youth services were represented,  contains a range of evidence based actions to support parents, young people, schools and community interests, in tackling this issue which can have a serious impact on young people. My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Action Plan in supporting  initiatives to raise awareness about the problem and implementing identified actions to tackle prejudice and promote a safer environment for our young people.  The Youth Clubs funded by my Department are an important outlet for children and young people in this context.  Their activities can help to build self esteem, increase confidence and strengthen friendships so that young people are better equipped to counter bullying behaviour.</p><p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department also provides funding towards the administration of the <i>National Youth Health Programme</i>  .  This programme is a partnership between my Department, the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) and the Health Service Executive.  Funding of some &#8364;88,000 was provided to support the programme in 2012 by my Department.</p><p>The aim of the programme is to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings. The programme has sought to develop the capacity of the sector and organisations to advocate on issues that affect young people and develop evidenced based resources and training to support that work.  The advantage of this training is evident in the fact that Youth Work often acts as the first point of contact and referral in the interface with other youth-related services spanning the realms of care, health and welfare.  In addition to mental health promotion in general, the programme delivers other training courses to Youth Workers on Mindfulness, Defusing Anger, Responding to Challenging Behaviours, Recognising and Managing Psychosis and Anti Bullying.  The Programme has published a manual on best practice in Youth Mental Health Promotion; <i>Good Habits of Mind </i>and another manual on Bullying:   <i>Lets Beat Bullying.</i></p><p>  My Department also provides funding to support the organisation Belong To under the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  BeLonG To Youth Service is a national organisation for Lesbian Gay Bisexual &amp; Transgender (LGBT) young people (age 14-23) in Ireland. They provide direct youth work services to LGBT young people across Ireland by providing spaces where LGBT young people can meet each other, get involved in activities and see that their identities and selves are valuable and important. To help change negative societal attitudes to LGBT training is given to teachers, youth-workers and other professionals who work with young people. They also run awareness campaigns in schools and youth services, and work with government departments, politicians and HGO&#8217;s to ensure that LGBT young people are heard, so that positive social change occurs.</p><p>  BeLonG To has a well developed advocacy programme that promotes positive recognition of LGBT young people, with a strong emphasis on ending homophobic bullying.  It has also supported and commissioned research projects in partnership with the Children&#8217;s Research Centre, the Anti-Bullying Centre, the National Drugs Strategy Team and the National Office for Suicide Prevention. In 2010 Guidelines on tackling homophobic bullying in youth services were developed by BeLong To. Youth Affairs Unit gave a one-off grant of &#8364;15,000 to fund this.</p></reply>

The Final Report of the Joint Committee recommended, in relation to adoption, that legislation should be introduced to provide for the adoption of any child, whether from a marital or non marital family, where the parents of that child have failed in their responsibility to that child for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law, and where adoption is considered to be in the best interests of the child. The Report also recommended that provision be made by law for the voluntary placement for adoption and the adoption of any child.</p><p>  The Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 proposes to make important changes to adoption law to provide the option of adoption for a child who has been placed in long term foster care because his or her parents are unable to provide, or resume, care for that child. The provisions of the proposed Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 will amend the Adoption Act 2010 to provide for the non-voluntary adoption of a child where his or her parents have failed in their duty towards that child.  The draft Bill will change the criteria, applicable under section 54 of the 2010 Act, under which the High Court may authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent, in the case of a child who is in the care of prospective adopters and where that child&rsquo;s parents have failed in their parental duty to the child. The proposed legislation is not intended to provide that a child, who has contact with and a strong beneficial relationship with his or her birth parents and wider family, may be adopted unless that child's parents have voluntarily placed the child for adoption and have consented to the adoption order being made in respect of the child. </p><p>  The draft Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents. In the case of a child of married parents, both parents must place the child for adoption and before doing so, will be counselled and given information in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of the Adoption Act 2010. </p><p>  It is my intention to bring the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible. In addition to the provisions included in the draft Bill, my Department is separately examining further possible changes to the Adoption Act 2010.</p></reply>

The Department was established in June 2011 with a mandate to put in place a unified framework of policy, legislation and provision across Government in respect of children and young people.</p><p>  The responsibilities of my Department encompass a wide range of policy and service activity, both direct and indirect, for children and young people in Ireland. It has a complex mandate, comprised of a number of separate, but interrelated strands including: the direct provision of a range of universal and targeted services; ensuring high-quality arrangements are in place for focused interventions dealing with child welfare and protection, family support, adoption, school attendance and reducing youth crime; the harmonisation of policy and provision across Government and with a wide range of stakeholders to improve outcomes for children, young people and families.</p><p>  As outlined in my Department's Statement of Strategy, in order to achieve its goals, my Department works in close partnership with other Government departments, statutory agencies and non-governmental organisations on a range of cross-cutting issues in relation to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people. The scope of this collaboration includes, but is not limited to, the following Department of Education and Skills (e.g. early childhood education, numeracy/literacy and skills development); Department of Justice and Equality (e.g. crime prevention, community sanctions, detention, diversion and equality);  Department of Health (e.g. disability; health promotion, including nutrition and drugs policy); Health Service Executive (e.g. child welfare and protection, care and social services); Department of Social Protection (e.g. social inclusion, income support and the activation agenda); Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (e.g. employment creation and youth entrepreneurship);  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (e.g. UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and Council of Europe measures); Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (e.g. initiatives involving sustainable development and communities).</p><p>  Funding requirements and how resources should be prioritised and allocated across each area of Government spending are generally considered as part of the annual estimates cycle and budgetary process. It would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time on any future decisions that may be taken by Government on the expenditure allocations for programmes and services falling within the Vote of my Department.  However, my objective will be to realise funding allocations that reflect expenditure policy priorities and that sufficient resources are directed towards those areas of greatest impact on children and young people.</p><p>  The commitment to establish a new Child and Family Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services. The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency. It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &euro;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team. </p><p>  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multidisciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p><p>  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function. </p><p>  The new Child and Family Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

I have met with individuals who have found themselves in these circumstance and I acknowledge and empathise with the dilemma that these individuals are addressing. </p><p>  Efforts have been made by the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the HSE, within their legal remit,  to facilitate the investigations that these individuals are undertaking in endeavouring to establish medical and/or identifying information about themselves.  Further efforts are required to move beyond that and endeavour to trace birth parents, children and or siblings who are affected by this issue. </p><p>In consultation with the AAI and the HSE, my Department is examining legislative and administrative options in relation to accessing records which may exist. I am also examining provisions in this regard in the forthcoming Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.   I have recently received further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in regard to complex legal and constitutional issues which have arisen during the course of drafting the Heads of Bill. These issues are currently under consideration in my Department. </p><p>  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register  in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact with another party sometime in the future. Fundamental to the success of the NCPR is that any persons with information in this regard contact the Information and Tracing Unit of the AAI.  The Adoption Act 1952 provided a legal basis for adoption in Ireland and for the establishment of the Adoption Board thereby bringing order to what had been the ad hoc arrangements which had previously existed in lieu of formal adoption procedures. That Act was replaced by the Adoption Act 2010. All adoptions in Ireland since 1952 have been carried out in line with this legislation.</p></reply>

The HSE is involved in a two-phase audit exercise. The report of phase 1, covering safeguarding arrangements in twenty-four Catholic dioceses, was published in October, 2012. The second phase involves a review of safeguarding practice in respect of approximately 140 Religious Congregations/Orders. This element, which ran parallel with the diocesan audit, is taking longer to complete due to the high number of Congregations involved. </p><p>  Separately the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church (NBSCCC) is also working through a review process involving the dioceses and Religious Congregations. To date  reports on ten dioceses and three Congregations have been published.</p><p>  The publication of the HSE diocesan audit report represented the culmination of a long process of engagement between the HSE and the diocesan authorities, to establish the position with regard to the Catholic Church in terms of the safeguarding of children and on responding to allegations of child sexual abuse against members of the clergy.  I welcomed the audit's finding that there has been a marked improvement in Church child protection practices in recent years, in particular since the Church&#8217;s new &#8216;Safeguarding Children&#8217; standards were introduced in 2009. It is also encouraging that the HSE found that the practice of responding to immediate risk to children was found to be generally good and is given priority within the dioceses. The audit found that prompt action has been taken by Bishops to remove priests from ministry where allegations have been made.</p><p>  While the audit highlighted recent improvements, it is clear that the focus must remain on addressing the need for ongoing improvements; in particular in those Dioceses identified by the audit as requiring further work. The report identified particular difficulties in categorising retrospective allegations with accuracy in terms of the time taken to report the allegations to the civil authorities. There were significant delays in reporting allegations to the civil authorities in the case of some of the dioceses. Also, in some instances dioceses had stated in their audit returns that they had reported all allegations promptly, but the HSE found that this was not the case.</p><p>The HSE audit recommended that the State &#8220;apply its resources to intervene and work with all dioceses in a systemic way to address the shortcomings outlined&#8221; and &#8220;to achieve closer monitoring by the State of dioceses&#8221;. In this context I had previously requested that the HSE's Children and Family Services engage on an ongoing basis with the NBSCCC on this issue. The purpose of this engagement is to ensure that the Church has in place all necessary structures and practices to safeguard children in line with the <i>Children First</i> National Guidance and the Church&#8217;s own guidelines. This engagement will continue to be prioritised within the new Child and Family Support Agency, with a particular focus on dioceses where shortfalls have been identified. Ensuring compliance with <i>Children First</i>   will be a key priority for the new Agency.</p><p>  The continuation by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church of its own review process into remaining dioceses and Religious Congregations, together with the HSE&#8217;s review of the Congregations, will provide further transparency in relation to current safeguarding arrangements within the Catholic Church. While there have been very notable improvements compared to historic practices that were entirely unacceptable, there is no room for complacency, as evidenced by the concerns I expressed about the outcome of the NBSCCC review of three Religious Congregations, published in September, 2012. For further details on its published reports and review plans I would direct the Deputy to the NBSCCC website - www.safeguarding.ie.</p><p>  I have stressed to both the HSE and the NBSCCC the importance of bringing both review processes to conclusion as speedily as possible, so as to provide a complete picture of child protection practices and compliance by the Catholic Church.</p></reply>

The purpose of foster care inspections is to review compliance with regulations and standards to support safe quality care for children placed in foster care. HIQA's inspection methodology includes interviewing HSE managers and social workers, a sample of children, carers and birth parents and review a range of files, including complaints.</p><p>  Foster care services in HSE Dublin North West Area have been inspected by HIQA on three occasions since September 2009, the most recent of which took place in October 2012.  Some progress was noted particularly in the area of foster carer assessment, approval and training with all general foster carers approved and significant improvements in the area of relative foster carers.  Some 96 % of children in foster care had been visited by a social worker within the preceding six months. </p><p>  An important finding in this inspection report is that many foster carers were providing high quality care and children's needs were being met.  Foster carers were committed and child centred in their approach.  They saw themselves as advocates on behalf of the child and availed of every opportunity to promote the child's best interests to achieve better outcomes.</p><p>  Notwithstanding progress that has been achieved, I was concerned to note that inspectors found that some deficits identified previously had not been rectified.  Inspectors found that there were inadequacies in systems to assess risk and to investigate and take timely action in response to concerns.  File keeping, data collection and analysis were also found to be lacking.</p><p>  The inspection also found that sufficient foster carers have not been recruited within the area and this has provided difficulties in making local placements and matching children with particular needs with the most suitable carers.  Recruitment of foster carers is of concern more generally and it is intended to conduct a national recruitment campaign in the coming months.    </p><p>  An Action Plan to address the weaknesses identified was prepared by HIQA.  In order to ensure that the Action Plan is fully implemented, I have requested that the HSE set up a high level oversight process to be lead by the Head of Quality Assurance to ensure implementation of all the HIQA recommendations. This group is now established and included Dr Valarie O&rsquo;Brien of UCD who has researched extensively in the area foster care.  The group will report to me on progress on a monthly basis.    Recently, I met with Mr Gordon Jeyes Chief Executive Designated of the Child and Family Support Agency to review the actions underway to address the critical issues identified.</p></reply>

Child and Adolescent Mental health issues are delivered on the basis of locally identified need.  Child and Adult Mental health issues are complex and can be present in a variety of ways and therefore there are a variety of programmes that address the following issues: Attention disorders; Depression; Anxiety disorders; Oppositional defiant behaviour, aggression, anti social behaviour; Eating disorders; Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, manic depressive disorder, or drug-induced psychosis; Deliberate self harm; Substance misuse; Autism spectrum disorders; Developmental disorders delay in acquiring certain skills such as speech, and social development.</p><p>  All social workers receive preparation in mental health issues during their third level training.  There are a variety of modules that deal with different aspects of mental health in the various pre-qualification courses including attachment theory, child and adolescent development, counselling skills, and addiction.  Social workers also access mental health training from other parts of the HSE such as the National Suicide Prevention Office e.g. Assist Training in mental health and suicide prevention.</p><p>  Additionally, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) employ social workers as part of mental health team's service provided to children and adolescents at risk.</p><p>  In preparation for the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency; a comprehensive Continuous Development Strategy is being prepared.  The strategy is based on carrying out systematic Training Needs Analysis and ensuring that priority training needs for the CFSA staff are addressed in a consistent manner.  Mental health training is a high priority for this group and the implementation of the CPD strategy will ensure that there is training available to all social workers in this area.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, 2005 provides for the establishment of a Social Workers Registration Board (CORU) which was appointed in 2010.  One of the functions of the SWRB is to set and enforce standards of education and training for the purposes of registration.  These standards were developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders including employers, professional bodies, education and public representatives.</p><p>  The Act makes provision for the approval of education and training programmes and the monitoring of continuing suitability of education and training programmes</p><p>  The system of statutory regulation is designed to ensure professional conduct and the maintenance of high standards of professional education and training among social workers, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self employed.</p><p>  The object of the Social Work Registration Board is to protect the public by fostering high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among social work registrants.</p><p>  The registration requirements will include a Continual Professional Development element and my officials will regularly liaise with CORU regarding emerging needs and priorities in this regard.</p></reply>

This plan identifies persons with key responsibility for actions, timelines for those actions and a review of the current position. The plan will be reviewed at intervals until all the actions are completed. With regard to progress on implementation there have been a number of key developments including substantive improvements in social work case allocation and case planning.</p><p>  The necessary actions are being implemented in the context of the Government&#8217;s reform programme for children&#8217;s services, the most radical reform of child welfare and protection services ever undertaken in the State. The integrated delivery of these reforms will ensure that responses to many of the ICDRG recommendations will be mainstreamed into the work programme of the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p><p>  At a broader policy and legislative level, detailed work is also underway to implement the ICDRG recommendations as follows:</p><p><b>Legislative Reform -</b> In order to support the rights of children generally, and particularly those who require the intervention of child welfare and protection services, the Constitutional referendum on children was held in November 2012.  Issues related to the in camera rule and child care court proceedings have also been subject to legislation.  The Child Care Act 1991 (Section 29(7) Regulations were made in November 2012 facilitating the public reporting of child care court proceedings by researchers.  These regulations have facilitated an independent project under Dr Carol Coulter which is carrying out research, for publication, on child care hearings in the courts.  The Government has recently published the Court Bill 2013 to directly address issues related to the in camera rule.  The draft Heads of the Children First Bill were considered by the Oireachtas Committee on Health &amp; Children and the report of the Committee is being considered by my Department in the development of these legislative proposals.  Consideration is also being given to strengthening legislation regarding the provision of aftercare.  I recently met with experts and representatives of organisations working with young people in care to discuss the approach. </p><p><b>Organisational Reform</b> - The Child and Family Agency will be an essential vehicle for ensuring the ethos of quality and accountability called for by the ICDRG is strongly reflected in children&#8217;s services.  </p><p><b>Operational Reform </b>- A central feature of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework which will prioritise serious child protection referrals while providing for development of new &#8216;Local Area Pathways&#8217; which will involve a greater use of community-based services to address child and family welfare concerns in a timely &amp; effective manner.  Significant work has taken place in relation to this service redesign.    A group has been established in the HSE to work with the Irish Youth Justice Service on the needs of the most vulnerable youths, in line with the needs highlighted in the Child Deaths Report.  Work is progressing on development of a National Child Care Information System to comprehensively address issues of record keeping and data management.  The procurement process is now at contract stage.  Two out-of-hours pilot projects in Donegal and Cork were commenced and independently evaluated.  The HSE has reviewed the Evaluation Report and prepared a business case for a National Out of Hours Social Work Service.  The HSE is in discussion with relevant staff representative associations.</p><p><b>Workforce Development - </b>this Government completed the recruitment of 260 additional social workers proposed in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan.  Over 1,400 social workers are employed in Children and Family Support Services and the introduction of 260 additional social workers represents a significant strengthening of the workforce.  Arrangements for the induction, training and supervision of these staff have been put in place.  Support for all staff includes the introduction of national guidance, such as Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook, and supervision of the implementation of this guidance.</p><p><b>Oversight -</b> Last July, I launched the first-ever HIQA &#8216;National Standards on Protection and Welfare of Children&#8217;. HIQA recently announced the commencement of inspections of child protection services, in line with new standards.  10 cases identified in the ICDRG report have been referred for independent review under Dr. Helen Buckley.  One of these reviews has already been completed.  Specific work is proceeding in relation to the Review Group&#8217;s recommendations regarding mechanisms for the independent review of child deaths.  It is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements are developed in a manner that is fully consistent with the major organisational reforms currently in train including the transfer of child protection services from the HSE to the CFSA and the recent expansion of HIQA&#8217;s inspection regime to cover all child protection services.  My Department has also consulted with colleagues in the North in order to share learning from the respective approaches to child death review.  I trust these details illustrate the seriousness with which the ICDRG report is being advanced.  Finally, my Department has also used the detailed research undertaken in the report to highlight more general policy issues across Government, including for example discussions on the preparation of a National Substance Misuse Strategy, which is expected to be considered by Government shortly.</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;53.173m has been provided to my Department for the provision of youth services in 2013.</p><p>  Funding is provided by my Department to a number of programmes which involve cross-border exchanges for young people.  One such programme is Causeway which is a Youth Exchange Programme established in 1998, following the Good Friday Agreement, between Ireland and UK for the East/West and North/South exchange of young people between the ages of 13 and 25, with particular regard given to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. All exchanges must include one Irish partner and at least one other partner either from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales.  L&eacute;argas-the Exchange Bureau is the administering agency for Causeway in Ireland. </p><p>  The Causeway programme aims to strengthen and improve relationships between young people, and those that who work with them, on the islands of Britain and Ireland. Causeway projects provide a valuable avenue for young people to explore their perceptions of identity and to deal with issues of tolerance and diversity. </p><p>  The Management Committee of Causeway includes representatives from my Department, the Department of Education Northern Ireland, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Youth Council of Northern Ireland together with L&eacute;argas, the administering body.</p><p>  Funding is also provided by my Department to Co-operation Ireland which was founded in 1979.  Its objective was to promote peace in a new and practical way. Originally called Co-operation North, its aim is to promote cross-border relations.   Co-operation Ireland develops programmes which enable people from communities North and South to participate in cross-border and cross community programmes. The funding provided by my Department has supported cross-border exchange projects for young people </p><p>  In addition my Department provides funding for The President's Award - Gaisce which is the National Challenge Award from the President of Ireland to the young people of Ireland (15 to 25 years of age). Gaisce is a member of the International Award Association which comprises 121 countries world wide.  The purpose of the Award is to encourage young people to set and achieve a demanding challenge for themselves in a non-competitive environment. The Award is conducted through schools, youth clubs and youth organisations and with the assistance and support of many other state and non-state sector bodies.</p><p>  Members of youth groups in Belfast who wish to avail of Gaisce the President&rsquo;s Award may register with the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award in Northern Ireland for the Joint Award Programme.  On completion of the programme they can choose to have the Gaisce Award presented. In 2011 231 Awards were presented in Northern Ireland</p><p>  My Department is also a member of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for Youth Work (NSETS) which  was launched in January 2006 by the then Minister for Education for Northern  Ireland and the Minister of State for Youth Affairs in the Republic.</p><p>  The decision to establish NSETS was to create a framework for the endorsement of Youth Work education and training that would ensure and support best practice and facilitate professional mobility and exchange both on a north/south and east/west basis.</p><p>  The role of NSETS committee to date has been to assess all aspects of the quality of training for professional youth and community work offered by Higher Education Institutions in Ireland and professionally endorse the programmes submitted to it.</p><p>  My Department provides funding towards the secretariat of NSETS which is currently carried out by Youth Council of Northern Ireland.

The North South Ministerial Council meets in Sectorial Format to oversee co-operation in agreed areas/sectors. At these Sectorial meetings the Irish Government is represented by the Minister or the Minister of State responsible for that Sector, and the Northern Ireland Executive is represented by two Ministers nominated by the First Minister and deputy First Minister on a cross-community basis.</p><p>  Following a North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting in February 2008, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety [DHSSPS] and the then Office of the Minister for Children (now DCYA) established a Cross Border Group on Child Protection, comprising officials from relevant departments to intensify cooperation on Child Protection including early progress on an all-island Child Protection awareness campaign; the identification of other medium/long term measures to improve Child Protection, including an examination of an all-island approach to child protection, focusing in particular on vetting and exchange of information; any areas for co-operation on children&rsquo;s services emerging from the North South Feasibility Study on health and social services.</p><p>  The cross border group is co-chaired by DCYA and DHSSPS.  In June, 2008, it was agreed to take forward 5 initiatives   through a sub-group structure, in areas where co-operation, shared learning and best practice could be of benefit to both jurisdictions, and to meet every six months to review progress. The first five sub-groups were</p><p>(i) Vetting and Barring Protocol</p><p>Terms of Reference: to work together to ensure that the land border between the north and south of Ireland cannot be exploited by individuals considered unsuitable to work with vulnerable groups by: Considering existing or planned vetting and barring arrangements in each jurisdiction; establishing if and how these arrangements could be strengthened by or benefit from the mutual exchange of relevant information; exploring the potential for the alignment of legislation around vetting and barring requirements between the two jurisdictions.</p><p>(ii) Research and Knowledge Transfer in Child Protection</p><p>Terms of Reference: to seek to ensure that key Government policy documents, publications of inquiries and inspections as well as executive summaries of case management and serious case reviews in the field of child protection should be readily available to practitioners; to explore the potential for a dedicated North-South child protection database resource for practitioners as well as the optimum structures for enabling knowledge and learning to be transferred into practice;</p><p>(iii) Internet Safety</p><p>Terms of Reference: To share best practice in the area of internet safety, i.e. the protection of children and young people from illegal and harmful internet content; To consider the scope for cross-border co-operation in this field, particularly in the area of public awareness raising of internet safety issues; To explore the strategic alignment of the approach to addressing internet safety issues and related technologies in both jurisdictions.</p><p>(iv) All-Ireland Media Awareness </p><p>Terms of Reference: To examine how best all-island public awareness campaigns can be developed in relation to child welfare and protection and be carried out to complement any such information dissemination on either side of the border and to exchange learning on these issues for mutual benefits and coordination.</p><p>(v) Inter-Jurisdictional Protocol for the Transfer of Child Care cases between Northern Ireland and Ireland</p><p>Terms of Reference: To review existing arrangements, structures and legislative framework in the different jurisdictions regarding the movement of vulnerable children and their families across Irish and UK borders; To develop a common protocol (taking account of existing arrangements, structures and legislative framework) for the movement of vulnerable children and their families across Irish and UK borders.  This protocol will give guidance on agreed thresholds and definitions which will trigger exchange of information.</p><p>  The Steering Group agreed that since the work of the first five sub-groups has largely been completed these can be stood down and a new work programme developed. The group, in July 2012, explored a number of areas of potential co-operation and recommended that a future programme of work be taken forward through five specific work streams focussing on:</p><p>Work Stream 1</p><p>Knowledge Exchange Forum - This work stream will promote continued learning through use of research and evidence based practice.  The first &lsquo;product&rsquo; of this work stream will be an &lsquo;All-Island Conference&rsquo;, to ne held on the 1   of May 2013. This conference aims to share practice knowledge, research and learning amongst policy makers, practitioners and managers in relation to safeguarding and child protection practices.</p><p>Work Stream 2</p><p>Quality and Effectiveness - This work stream will progress initiatives to build workforce capacity and improve the quality and effectiveness of social work and social care work interventions and practice.  It is anticipated that &lsquo;learning pathways&rsquo; and resources in relation to agreed key practice areas (eg; Child Development) will be developed to inform professional education and training curricula and planning and to support joint or shared training initiatives.</p><p>  Work Stream 3</p><p>Deaths of Children in Care - This work stream will contribute to learning in relation to deaths of children in care by developing an overview and analysis of the features of deaths of children in care in both jurisdictions.</p><p>Work Stream 4</p><p>Cultural Competence in Safeguarding - This work stream will assist to develop common guidance for practitioners working with other cultures and develop a publication of Good Practice Notes for work with new communities.  It will focus upon promoting safeguarding practice in the context of legislative and procedural compliance whilst respecting equality and diversity.  </p><p>  Work Stream 5</p><p>Specialist Services - This work stream will explore opportunities to develop specialist services on a cross-border basis to assist in meeting the needs of those children and families where there is a requirement for a high volume of expertise combined with a low volume turnover of clientele.  </p><p>  In addition, the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department is involved in a North-South Process which is led by the Department of Justice and Equality under the auspices of the St. Andrews Agreement.   The Youth Justice Project Advisory Group is one of six strands in this process. It aims to guide and support co-operation in the youth justice area on both sides of the border; to provide a forum for the active exchange of information, ideas and expertise between participating bodies on matters including restorative justice and tackling re offending; and the examination and identification of the areas where joint working could take place.  The North-South Youth Justice Project Advisory Group meets twice a year and reports to the North-South High Level Senior Officials Group.</p></reply>

One of the core functions of a youth caf&eacute; is that it offers support to young people, ranging from practical support to advice through their participation in activities that are of interest to them and that are varied and on offer at times that suit their normal activities. In awarding funding, my Department will endeavour to ensure that there is a geographical spread of youth caf&eacute;s from the funding commensurate to existing provision in the area.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Applications are only eligible from community and voluntary organisations with a minimum of three years experience of working with young people and the delivery of youth services.

It is estimated by my Department that 75-100 youth caf&eacute; facilities now operate across the State.  These facilities are proving hugely beneficial to local communities in terms of broader engagement with young people.  In addition, my Department supports a range of youth services and volunteer-led youth groups which offer similar resources and spaces for young people locally.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Under the 2012 Irish Research Council Research Development Initiative, co-funded by my Department and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, a research project is underway in the National University of Ireland, Galway to examine the impact of the youth caf&eacute; initiative.  It is expected that this research will be completed by the end of 2013 and the results of this will be taken into consideration in the deliberations by my Department concerning the future direction of youth caf&eacute; development.</font></p></reply>

The amount allocated will rise to &euro;4.75 in 2015. It is envisaged that this Initiative will be co-funded by a philanthropic partner and discussions are ongoing to this end.  A Project Team, which is chaired by my Department and includes officials from a number of key Government departments and agencies, was established in February of this year to progress the Initiative.</p><p>  The new Initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP).   The PEIP involved a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour. These programmes are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.  The three PEIP sites are expected to participate in the new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative later this year along with at least 3 further sites.</p><p>  The new Initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people where these are currently significantly poorer than they are for children and young people living elsewhere in the State.  </p><p>  The Initiative will consist of the following components: continuation of interventions, where appropriate, in the 3 existing PEIP sites, subject to those programmes being supported by positive evaluations and evidence; selection of at least 6 sites (including as appropriate existing PEIP sites), where multifaceted approaches to addressing Child Outcomes via evidence based programmes will be  implemented.  The impact of these interventions will be monitored in a cost-effective manner, to ensure they have the intended outcomes on child well-being.  In time, the mainstreaming of proven, cost-effective evidence-based programmes into service delivery in a wider context than the areas specifically participating in the Area-Based initiative.  </p><p>I understand that comprehensive details and guidance in relation to the application process will e available from my Department from the end of this week.  In addition, my Department will hold an Information Seminar on 25 April next to provide further guidance and information to applicants.

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries. The proposed legislation is intended to provide for a structured and regulated approach for applicants seeking access to adoption information and is also intended to facilitate contact between parties affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected. </p><p>  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information to identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the<b></b>  Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. </p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis. The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter  his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  </p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines to be set out in regulations. It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.</p><p>  It is also intended that, prior to the release of adoption information, counselling will be offered by the Adoption Authority, the HSE or by an accredited body to an adopted person, a birth parent or to an adoptive parent.  </p><p>  Complex legal and Constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill  including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy. I have recently received further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in this regard and that advice is currently being examined in my Department.  I am anxious to bring these matters to resolution in order to advance the Heads of Bill to Government. However, there are undoubtedly challenges remaining in developing a workable framework which respects the Constitutional rights of all parties. I remain committed to achieving my policy objectives notwithstanding these challenges.</p></reply>

Given the huge number of applications the programme was very competitive and all applications were considered in their own right against the programme criteria.    In prioritising applications with similar merits the criteria gave consideration to levels of deprivation in the immediate locality of the service and, to a lesser degree, to whether the applicant received previous capital grant funding that represented a stake meriting protection.</p><p>  I have been successful in securing &euro;2.75m in capital funding in Budget 2013 to support the ongoing improvement of the childcare sector.  Community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers/childminders that are currently providing services under one or more of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs funding programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme - are eligible to apply.  This includes those services registered with the Irish Montessori Education Board that meet the new programme criteria.</p><p>The 2013 funding programme covers four strands: Strand 1 - small grants to purchase equipment or carry out small maintenance work; Strand 2 - grants to improve accessibility of services for children with disabilities; Strand 3 - grants to provide natural outdoor spaces that promote active outdoor play; and Strand 4 - grants towards critical works to ensure that buildings are fit for purpose under the childcare regulations (open to community/not-for-profit services only).  It should be noted that in the case of applications for funding under Strand 3, the HSE will be consulted in relation to the proposed works.  Applicants who are not required to be notified to the HSE will receive an on-site visit from Pobal or the local City/County Childcare Committee to verify the application and validate the need for the proposed works.</p><p>  The 2013 Childcare Capital Programme will also be administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department.  Full details of the Programme, including instructions on how to apply for a grant, are available on the Pobal website at www.pobal.ie.  Applications must be made on-line, and the closing date for applications is Tuesday, 30 April 2013.</p></reply>

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea a coastal state has exclusive rights within its EEZ over fishing (although all EU member states have transferred their competence for conservation and management of sea fisheries to the EU), the production of energy from water and wind, the protection of the marine environment and the conduct of marine scientific research.  A coastal state also enjoys exclusive sovereign rights to the recovery of oil and gas from the seabed beneath the EEZ, although this is governed by the separate legal regime of the continental shelf.     Since the UK became a party to the UN Convention in 1997 the declared zones of the two countries have overlapped at the edges.   Since the UK became a party to the UN Convention in 1997 the declared zones of the two countries have overlapped at the edges.  Over the past few years negotiations between Ireland and the UK have been undertaken with the objective of establishing EEZ boundaries between the two countries and I&rsquo;m glad to say that these have now been successfully concluded.  As the Deputy is aware the British Ambassador and I signed t  he Agreement establishing a single maritime boundary between the Exclusive Economic Zones and continental shelves of Ireland and the UK in Dublin on 28 March last.  This Agreement removes the overlaps between the EEZs of the two countries and now both the EEZs and the continental shelf beneath them will follow the same boundaries.  This involved some small technical adjustments to the existing continental shelf boundaries in order to ensure that for any part of the boundary areas the same state exercises jurisdiction over the seabed and the water directly above it.  </p><p>  The Agreement brings legal certainty to boundary issues.  This in turn will improve the protection of fisheries.  While EU member states have transferred competence to the EU for the conservation and management of sea fisheries they remain responsible for enforcement of EU fisheries law within their own jurisdictions.  Under the new Agreement therefore it will now be clear which state is responsible for law enforcement in EEZ areas that previously overlapped.  Likewise there will now be clarity about which state is responsible for licensing renewable energy projects within EEZ boundary areas and for protecting the marine environment in those areas.  </p><p>Before the Agreement can be brought into force the Government must make an Order under the 2006 Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act to prescribe the new EEZ boundaries and an Order under the 1968 Continental Shelf Act to amend the existing continental shelf boundaries.  The Orders will then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in   accordance with the relevant provisions of the two Acts.  Once the Agreement has been brought into force it will be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with Article 29 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  </p></reply>

The closure of the resident embassy to the Holy See has yielded substantial savings, not least as it enabled the significantly larger embassy to Italy and the residence of the ambassador to Italy to be relocated to the State-owned Villa Spada, formerly occupied by the embassy to the Holy See, thereby saving &euro;445,000 per annum in rent on two properties.

Section 16 of the Act makes particular provision for the issue of diplomatic passport to persons who hold a diplomatic rank or to persons whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs considers it appropriate to issue such a passport in order to carry out their duties.  The broad provisions of this are as follows.  Passports are issued to officers of diplomatic grade who are assigned abroad to serve in Irish diplomatic and consular missions, their spouses and accompanying children in full-time education. It should be noted that some officers serving in non-diplomatic grades may be issued diplomatic passports as a result of requirements of the host country.  The validity of a diplomatic passport covers the duration of the foreign posting which usually is for three or four years.  Officials and family members are required to surrender their diplomatic passports for cancellation on their return to Headquarters at the end of their postings.  Diplomatic passports are renewed in the event that an officer&rsquo;s foreign posting at a particular mission is extended or if that officer is transferred to another mission.  These passports are issued to HQ-based officers who are required to travel abroad on official Departmental business.  Officials of my Department who are assigned to international organisations such as European Union or the United Nations and who are required to travel on behalf of these institutions are eligible for diplomatic passports.</p><p>It is important to clarify that possession of a diplomatic passport does not, as a matter of international law, entitle the holder to any privileges or immunities, except in certain cases specifically provided for in international law or in the domestic law of the host country.  However, most countries do extend some form of courtesy and consideration to persons in possession of diplomatic passports, including in some cases a fast-track immigration channel.  The nature of such courtesies depends on the law and practice of each state, and, accordingly varies from state to state.</p><p>Additionally, possession of a diplomatic passport does not exempt the holder from immigration or visa requirements.  Indeed, the holder of a diplomatic passport may be required by certain host countries, e.g. the United States, to obtain a visa in cases where the holder of an ordinary passport would not.  Visas attached to diplomatic and official passports are normally issued free of charge.</p><p>Since 1999 a total of 224 officials of the Department have retired.  A breakdown of their grades is provided in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Secretary General</td><td>   2</td></tr><tr><td>Second Secretary</td><td>   2</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy Secretary</td><td>   6</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Secretary</td><td>  28</td></tr><tr><td>Counsellor/Principal Officer</td><td>  29</td></tr><tr><td>First Secretary/Assistant Principal Officers</td><td>  25</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officers and Executive Officers</td><td>  20</td></tr><tr><td>Staff and Clerical Officers</td><td>  81</td></tr><tr><td>Technical staff (Legal advisers, Aid specialists etc)</td><td>   8</td></tr><tr><td>Support staff ( Services Officer, Cleaners)</td><td>  23</td></tr></table></p><p>Officers who retire and/or who no longer qualify to hold a diplomatic passport are required to surrender their diplomatic passport for cancellation.  A very small number of persons who were formerly employed by my Department currently hold diplomatic passports on the basis of their current status.  These are officials serving in other Government Departments, the EU or the UN, or accompanying diplomatic spouses.  I am informed that no retired officer outside these categories currently holds a valid diplomatic passport.</p><p>Diplomatic officers in my Department travelling for non-official purposes (other than in the case of those posted abroad who are travelling to or from their country of accreditation) are expected to travel on a standard non-diplomatic passport for which they must apply and pay for on the same basis as any other citizen.   Retired officers wishing to travel abroad must do so using a standard non-diplomatic passport.</p></reply>

It is something I take very seriously.  Our Embassy in Tanzania, working with other EU Member States and UN agencies, is closely monitoring the situation and continues to raise the need for all parties, including the Government and the local community, to deal with the issue through open dialogue and constructive engagement.  Ireland has made a significant contribution to development and the fight against poverty in Tanzania.  In the past decade, Tanzania has recorded improvements in human development, as measured by the UN Human Development Index.  This progress, which has been made with Irish support and support from other donors, is a strong example of the success of international development assistance when delivered in partnership with a developing country Government.  However, positive development results and respect for human rights must go hand in hand.  Ireland remains strongly committed to helping build good governance and the rights of the most vulnerable in Tanzania and elsewhere, and this will remain a clear priority of our development assistance programme.</p></reply>

The issue of a passport is, therefore, the culmination of an important and legally binding process.  The checks and balances within the passport process embrace the standard principles that are provided for in the Act and help to ensure that the identity of the applicant is known and that the person in question is an Irish citizen.  This serves to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which, in turn, ensures the safe travel and well-being of Irish citizens as they travel abroad.  Moreover, it helps to combat passport and identity fraud.  These documents confirm the details of a person&rsquo;s birth name, date of birth and place of birth, all of which are critical components of a person&rsquo;s identity.  These can also help to demonstrate a person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship and in the case of children, who their legal guardians are.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.236.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600056#WRE02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198, 213, 234, 320, 359 and 360 together.</p><p>Section 119 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that the Local Property Tax (LPT) for 2013 is not payable until 1 July 2013.  The legislation also provides that property owners may choose to pay the tax for the current year in equal instalments over the period from 1 July 2013 to the end of December 2013.  The three phased payment options are deduction at source, direct debit, and payment by cash, credit or debit card through one of the approved payment service providers. The Revenue Commissioners advise that where a phased payment option is chosen, there is no additional administration or interest charge imposed by Revenue.  However, a transaction fee may be charged by financial institutions and by the service providers.</p><p>Instalment payments can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The frequency of LPT deductions will depend on the frequency of salary or other payments made to the property owner by their employer, pension provider or Government Department.  There are no fees or charges associated with the deduction at source option.  Monthly phased payments can also be made by way of direct debit from the property owner's current account in a bank and other financial institution including a credit union.  In these cases, the direct debit deductions will commence on 15 July 2013 and will be deducted on the 15th day of each month thereafter up to 15 December 2013.  Normal direct debit fees charged by financial institutions apply to these payments.  Phased payments can also be made either in cash or by debit or credit card through one of the three approved payment service providers, which are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  The appointed service providers have extensive nationwide outlets.  Payment of LPT can be made in full through these service providers or by phased payments on a weekly or monthly basis.  Charges are imposed by payment service providers on a per transaction basis.  I am advised that An Post levies a charge of &euro;1 per transaction, while Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.  I understand that Payzone will be introducing the following charges this week: 75 cent per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100.</p><p>Concerns have been raised about customers who opt to pay LPT on a weekly basis through a cash payment in the post office being faced with transaction charges of &euro;52 per annum as a result of the &euro;1 service charge per transaction imposed by An Post.  While the Revenue Commissioners require any payment service provider to satisfy certain terms and conditions in order to be approved to provide the service, it is solely a matter for each provider, including An Post, to determine the rate of any transactional charge that may apply in the provision of this service.  As I have indicated earlier, an alternative method of paying LPT on a phased basis, cost-free, is for the property owner to opt to have the tax deducted at source from employment, occupational pension income or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The amount of each instalment payment that has to be made by the property owner will depend on the amount of LPT due that is associated with the particular valuation band that the owner's property falls within.  It is also dependent on when the option is exercised.  In this regard, to ensure the payment is spread over the full six months from July, paper returns should be filed on or before 7 May and online by 28 May.  Otherwise, the amount collected in each instalment may be higher.  The table that follows this reply sets out the weekly and monthly payments for 2013 for each valuation band, where a property is valued at less than &euro;1 million and the returns are filed on time.  The amounts shown are exclusive of any fees imposed by payment service providers and financial institutions.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the payment method selected for 2013 will automatically apply for 2014 and subsequent years unless the property owner advises Revenue that he or she wished to select an alternative method.  I am satisfied that the range of payment options provides a great amount of flexibility in paying the tax and will allow liable persons to choose the option that suits their own particular circumstances.</p><p><b>Details of the amount of LPT that will be deducted according to each valuation band</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Valuation Band Number</th><th>Valuation Band <br /><br /><br /><br />&#8364;</th><th>Mid-point of <br />Valuation Band <br /><br />&#8364;</th><th>LPT in 2013 <br />(half-year charge)<br /><br />&#8364;</th><th>Monthly Payment<br /><br /><br />&#8364;</th><th>Weekly Payment<br /><br /><br />&#8364;</th></tr><tr><td>01</td><td>0 to 100,000</td><td>50,000</td><td>45</td><td>7.50</td><td>1.73</td></tr><tr><td>02</td><td>100,001 to 150,000</td><td>125,000</td><td>112</td><td>18.66</td><td>4.30</td></tr><tr><td>03</td><td>150,001 to 200,000</td><td>175,000</td><td>157</td><td>26.16</td><td>6.03</td></tr><tr><td>04</td><td>200,001 to 250,000</td><td>225,000</td><td>202</td><td>33.66</td><td>7.76</td></tr><tr><td>05</td><td>250,001 to 300,000</td><td>275,000</td><td>247</td><td>41.16</td><td>9.50</td></tr><tr><td>06</td><td>300,001 to 350,000</td><td>325,000</td><td>292</td><td>48.66</td><td>11.23</td></tr><tr><td>07</td><td>350,001 to 400,000</td><td>375,000</td><td>337</td><td>56.16</td><td>12.96</td></tr><tr><td>08</td><td>400,001 to 450,000</td><td>425,000</td><td>382</td><td>63.66</td><td>14.69</td></tr><tr><td>09</td><td>450,001 to 500,000</td><td>475,000</td><td>427</td><td>71.16</td><td>16.42</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>500,001 to 550,000</td><td>525,000</td><td>472</td><td>78.66</td><td>18.15</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>550,001 to 600,000</td><td>575,000</td><td>517</td><td>86.16</td><td>19.88</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>600,001 to 650,000</td><td>625,000</td><td>562</td><td>93.66</td><td>21.61</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>650,001 to 700,000</td><td>675,000</td><td>607</td><td>101.16</td><td>23.34</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>700,001 to 750,000</td><td>725,000</td><td>652</td><td>108.66</td><td>25.07</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>750,001 to 800,000</td><td>775,000</td><td>697</td><td>116.16</td><td>26.80</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>800,001 to 850,000</td><td>825,000</td><td>742</td><td>123.66</td><td>28.53</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>850,001 to 900,000</td><td>875,000</td><td>787</td><td>131.16</td><td>30.26</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>900,001 to 950,000</td><td>925,000</td><td>832</td><td>138.66</td><td>32.00</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>950,001 to 1,000,000</td><td>975,000</td><td>877</td><td>146.16</td><td>33.73</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The conditionality in these documents is subject to continuing assessment by the Irish Authorities and the EU, IMF, ECB (the Troika) to ensure the board programme objectives are met.  Such assessment is undertaken at the quarterly reviews.  These review missions include discussions where programme commitments are updated and agreed after every mission.  The introduction of a property tax has been a condition of the Programme since it was first negotiated in November 2010 and has remained a condition following subsequent reviews.  All of the programme documents are available on my Department&#8217;s website.  The original Memorandum of Understanding contained certain provisions regarding the safeguarding of the public finances.  However, it did not make specific reference to the amount to be collected by way of property tax or to the number of houses expected to be covered.  The Safeguarding Public Finances section of the document, which is available at <i>www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/reports/2011/euimfrevised.pdf</i>, stated:<blockquote>  21. To continue with the programme of fiscal consolidation, a comprehensive National Recovery Plan 2011-14 was approved by the Government and published on 24 November 2010.  This Plan forms the basis for the 2011 budget consistent with fiscal consolidation measures amounting to &#8364;15 billion, a 9 percent of GDP budgetary correction over the period 2011&#8211;14.  Having stabilised the deficit, albeit at a high level, the steps announced in the Plan will place the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path.  While the debt-to-GDP ratio will remain at high levels for the next few years, it is projected to decline thereafter, underpinning debt sustainability.  We also propose to keep under review progress towards meeting the Stability and Growth Pact targets.<br /><br /><br />  22. Budget 2011 which will include adjustment measures of &#8364;6 billion, will be submitted to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for passage on 7 December (prior action).  As set out in the National Recovery Plan, most of this adjustment will come from the expenditure side.  The capital budget will be reduced, partly through greater value for money in our infrastructure procurements.  On current expenditures, we are pursuing public service numbers reductions through natural attrition and voluntary schemes, adjustments in public service pensions, and further savings on social transfers (from reductions in working age payments, reductions in universal child benefit payments and other reforms).  Protecting the socially vulnerable at a time of difficult economic adjustment remains a central policy goal.  Current savings will also be realised from streamlining government programmes and through administrative efficiencies.  Should these savings or the expected numbers reductions not materialise, we reserve the option to take further measures.<br /><br /><br />  23. An income tax-led revenue package&#8212;sized at over &#8364;2 billion in a full year&#8212;will supplement the above expenditure measures in 2011.  Over the past decade, the proportion of citizens exempt from income tax has risen to 45 percent and tax credits have doubled, resulting in a comparatively low burden of tax on ordinary incomes.  This is no longer sustainable.  Accordingly, we are widening the tax base, by lowering income tax bands and credits by 10 percent, and by reducing various pension-related tax reliefs.  We are also taking action on other tax expenditures, and distortions arising from the existence of multiple levies.<br /><br /><br />  24. To secure our fiscal targets, a number of fiscal measures have been identified for 2012&#8211;14.  We will continue to rely on expenditure savings (&#8364;6.1 billion), led by current spending (&#8364;4.9 billion), as outlined in the National Recovery Plan.  We are targeting further reductions in public sector numbers, social benefits and programme spending, and have anchored the prospective savings by publishing multi-year expenditure ceilings by Vote Group through 2014.  We are also planning to move towards full cost-recovery in the provision of water services and ensuring a greater student contribution towards tertiary education, while ensuring that lower-income groups remain supported.  In addition, we will accelerate the process of placing the pension systems on a path consistent with long-term sustainability of public finances.  On the tax side, we will build on the base-broadening measures outlined above and establish a sound basis for sub-national finances through a new residential-property based site value tax.  The Finance Bill 2012 will contain necessary provisions to bring into effect the already signalled VAT increases in 2013 and 2014.<br /><br /><br />  25. We are preparing institutional reform of the budget system taking into account anticipated reforms of economic governance at the EU level.  A reformed Budget Formation Process will be put in place.  Furthermore, we will introduce a Fiscal Responsibility Law which will include provision for a medium-term expenditure framework with binding multiannual ceilings on expenditure in each area by end-July 2011 (structural benchmark).  A Budget Advisory Council, to provide an independent assessment of the Government&#8217;s budgetary position and forecasts will also be introduced by end-June 2011 (structural benchmark).  These important reforms will enhance fiscal credibility and anchor long-term debt sustainability.</blockquote></p></reply>

Part 1 of the P45 is given to Revenue to notify that the employment has ceased.  Parts 2, 3 and 4 are given to the employee to avoid paying emergency tax in a new employment, to claim a refund of tax during unemployment, and/or to claim Social Welfare benefits.  If an employee does not get a P45 when leaving, he or she should ask the employer for one and repeat the request if necessary.  If the employer still fails to give the P45, the employee should notify his or her local Revenue office that he or she has failed, after several attempts, to get a P45 and Revenue will quickly take up the matter with the employer.  The taxpayer in question contacted Revenue on 8 April 2013 regarding his failure to obtain a P45.  The PAYE Compliance Unit, Cork North West District, Revenue House, Blackpool, Cork is now dealing with this matter.  I understand that most such cases are resolved quickly following intervention by Revenue.  Where the problem persists, an employer who fails to issue a P45 may be subject to civil penalties under section 987 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for breach of the PAYE regulations, or may be charged with a Revenue offence under section 1078 of the same Act for failing, without reasonable excuse, to issue a required certificate or notification.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that residential properties purchased under the various local authority shared ownership schemes will also be subject to LPT and that the liable person in these instances will be the purchaser.  This is on the basis that, under these schemes, the purchaser acquires a leasehold interest in the property for a period that exceeds 20 years.  Such a purchaser is in the same position as a property owner who purchases a residential property with a mortgage from a financial institution.  Accordingly, there is no reason such an individual should not be liable for payment of the LPT on the property.  As in the case of any other liable person, the LPT is based on the &quot;chargeable value&quot; of the property, which is the price the unencumbered fee simple of the property might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market were that property to be sold on the valuation date in such manner and subject to such conditions as might reasonably be calculated to obtain for the vendor the best price for the property.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as LPT is a self-assessed tax, in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  I would like to clarify that the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved, as a matter of routine, in valuing individual properties.  As part of the general issue of Returns that commenced on 11 March 2013 and which is now almost complete, property owners received an information booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner&rsquo;s individual property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT they should pay.  Once the property owner meets his or her obligations by determining the valuation band for their property, submitting the Return and advising Revenue of his or her payment method within the relevant time limits, the Revenue Estimate of LPT notified to the owner is no longer relevant.  However, if the property owner considers that the amount shown on the Notice of Estimate accurately reflects his or her self-assessment, he or she should complete the Return on that basis, select a payment option and submit the Return.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the valuation guidance developed by the Commissioners and which is now available on their website, is designed to help property owners in self-assessing the market value of their property by giving them average, indicative values for their area.  This guidance should not be used in isolation but together with other sources of information and the property owner&rsquo;s knowledge of their neighbourhood and their own property.  Other useful sources include the publicly available property price register produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, the property section of local newspapers, information from local estate agents and property websites.  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.  Finally, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as the issues raised are specific to the members of the particular Residents Association, Revenue will correspond directly with the Association to address these issues.  The Commissioners also advise that they will send you a copy of any reply that they issue to the Association.</p></reply>

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  The Credit Reviewer, Mr John Trethowan, said in his most recent quarterly report that &quot;both banks have achieved their &#8364;3.5bn SME loan sanction targets&quot; and that &quot;over &#8364;8bn was sanctioned in 2012; of which approx. &#8364;2.5bn (27%) is new lending drawn down&quot;.  According to the Credit Review Office, the balance of the sanctioned lending represented restructured or refinanced credit to SMEs. The Credit Review Office in the past has noted that this is important in terms of sustaining the businesses and the associated jobs.</p><p>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks, the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  The banks have submitted their lending plans for 2013 to my Department.  My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, has analysed the plans and has met the banks to discuss them. The banks also meet the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.  My officials and I will engage robustly with the banks to ensure they meet their 2013 targets.  It is important to note that the targets for 2013 represent an increase of 33% over the 2011 targets.  My Department&#8217;s review of 2012 is available at <i>www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=7609&amp;CatID=45&amp;StartDate=01+January+2013</i>.  It contains details of some of the actions taken in 2012 including demand surveys, ongoing consultation with the SME sector, initiatives with the banks, the Credit Review Office review and increase of its resources and NPRF funds for the SME sector.  Another demand survey is currently being conducted by Red C on behalf of the Department. </p><p>  Access to Finance for SMEs is a key aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. It is the Government&#8217;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  The SME State Bodies Group was established in 2012 to both develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation. It will continue in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee. My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance.</p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions, particularly where SMEs have been refused credit, to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs.  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks.  This can arise because the SME's lack of collateral or the banks' lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology.  The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme.  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &#8364;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  One of the most powerful ways of ensuring the pillar banks provide credit to viable SMEs is through access to the Credit Review process.  I would strongly advise anyone who has been refused credit to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p></reply>

Bank of Ireland has submitted the following information on credit applications: some 55,741 applications were received in 2012, some 47,531 applications were approved in 2012, and some 8,210 applications were declined in 2012.  The bank has also informed me that less than 1% of applications were pending decision at year end and these are included in the declined number.  Allied Irish Bank has submitted the following information on credit applications: some 34,254 applications were received in 2012, some 31,527 applications were approved in 2012, and some 2,727 applications were declined in 2012.  The AIB figures only refer to completed applications and do not include pending applications, the numbers of which would vary from time to time.  In addition, the Department of Finance credit demand survey conducted by Red C provides information in the outcome of credit applications by the firms surveyed.  The survey covers the period from April to September 2012 and showed that 56% of applications were approved in full, 4% partially approved, 21% were still pending and 19% were refused.  When the pending applications are excluded, this gives 76% approved in full or partially and 24% refused.  Red C is currently conducting another survey on behalf of my Department which will cover the period from October 2012 to March 2013.</p></reply>

For individuals on low incomes or those whose only income source is from the Department of Social Protection, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain cases.  A system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers is available where there is an inability to pay the tax and certain specified conditions are met.  A person who qualifies for full deferral can opt to defer 100% of the LPT liability.  A person who qualifies for partial deferral can opt to defer 50% of the liability and must pay the balance of LPT.  The deferral arrangements available under the legislation are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>Condition Number</th><th>Condition </th></tr><tr><td>Full Deferral</td><td>1</td><td>Gross income for the year is unlikely to exceed &#8364;15,000 (single or widow/er) and &#8364;25,000 (couple)</td></tr><tr><td>Full Deferral </td><td>2</td><td>Gross income for the year is unlikely to exceed the adjusted income limit. This adjusted income limit is calculated by increasing the thresholds of &#8364;15,000 (single or widow/er) and &#8364;25,000 (couple) by 80% of the expected mortgage interest payments for the year 2013. This applies until 31 December 2017.</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Deferral </td><td>3</td><td>Gross income for the year is unlikely to exceed &#8364;25,000 (single or widow/er) and &#8364;35,000 (couple).</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Deferral </td><td>4</td><td>Gross income for the year is unlikely to exceed the adjusted income limit. This adjusted income limit is calculated by increasing the thresholds of &#8364;25,000 (single or widow/er) and &#8364;35,000 (couple) by 80% of the expected mortgage interest payments for the year 2013. This applies until 31 December 2017.</td></tr></table></p><p>In all cases, interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum.  The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for those who do not qualify for deferral of the tax, there is a wide range of payment options available to liable persons, which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or to pay the tax for 2013 in equal instalments over the period 1 July 2013 to end December 2013.  As regards exemption for disabilities, an exemption from the charge to LPT will apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the chargeable value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence.  Provision is also made in the legislation for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.  The reduction is limited to the lesser of the market value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  Furthermore, the impact of specific adaptations on a property can be to decrease the value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that details of the existing exemptions are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, where the Commissioners have recently published a useful Guide to Local Property Tax.  I have no plans to extend the exemptions and reliefs from Local Property Tax currently provided in the legislation.</p></reply>

The Local Property Tax (LPT) is a market value based self-assessed charge.  It is based on bands of &euro;50,000 in width for properties valued between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1,000,000.  The amount payable is determined by the mid-point of the relevant band.  For properties valued at &euro;100,000 and under, the amount payable will be determined by the mid point of that band, that is, &euro;50,000.  The tax will be 0.18% of the mid point figure in each band up to &euro;1,000.000.  Properties valued under &euro;50,000 will be liable to LPT at the rate of 0.18% of &euro;50,000, which will be represented by a charge of &euro;90 in a full year, and &euro;45 for the half year to be charged in 2013.  Both Commissions on Taxation (2009 and 1982) recommended the grouping of values into broad bands, as did the Inter-Departmental Expert Group on the Design of a property tax, known as the Thornhill group.  The Government accepted the recommendation of the Thornhill group for a market value based system of self-assessment involving bands of &euro;50,000 in width for properties valued between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1,000,000, and a basic charge determined by applying the tax rate to the midpoint value of &euro;50,000 for properties valued at less than &euro;100,000. </p><p>  In assessing the appropriate market value bands, the Thornhill Group drew on the work undertaken for it by the ESRI and that carried out in the Department of Finance.  The ESRI's work suggests that some 90% of properties are currently valued at &euro;300,000 or less.  In making its decision, the Thornhill Group also had reference to work carried out by the Department of Finance, showing that the majority of properties (60%) fell within a valuation range of &euro;100,000 to &euro;200,000.  The use of bands allows property owners to place their properties in an appropriate valuation band with reasonable confidence, without potentially being exposed to disproportionate risks if they incorrectly self-assess the value of their property, and makes the valuation process as effective and unproblematic as possible for owners.  Grouping all except the most expensive properties into valuation bands will ease valuation challenges for liable persons.  The Government decided that a universal liability to the LPT should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  There are no plans to exempt properties valued at under &euro;50,000 from the LPT.  A person with limited means may be in a position, depending on circumstances, to defer payment of the tax.  The deferral provisions contained in the legislation are targeted at cases of needs and better address need than a blanket exemption for all properties valued at &euro;50,000 or under.</p></reply>

While there is no specific exemption available for a property that has been declared to be non-compliant with building regulations, it will be a matter for the property owner to decide whether non-compliance with building regulations has a material impact on the value of the property, and if so, to what extent.  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, together with a liable person&rsquo;s own knowledge of their property, will assist them in choosing the correct valuation band for their property.  One of the advantages of the banding system of values provided for in the legislation is to remove the need for precision in relation to the market value, except for properties worth over &euro;1 million.  As I have stated before in the House, where Revenue&rsquo;s guidance is used honestly the property valuation will not be challenged by Revenue, in accordance with their normal Customer Service Charter.</p></reply>

Accordingly, whilst those whose homes were damaged during the works may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific exemption in this instance.  I have no plans to introduce such an exemption.   The Government decided that a universal liability to the Local Property Tax (LPT) should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.</p></reply>

The Commissioners&rsquo; &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo;, which is published on the Revenue website (<i>www.revenue.ie</i>), includes a wide range of measures designed to target those engaged in the supply and sale of illicit tobacco products and very significant resources are being devoted to this issue in 2013.  This multi-faceted strategy includes:</p><p>- the ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem</p><p>- developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis</p><p>- the ongoing review of operational policies by a high-level group within Revenue that is chaired by one of the Commissioners</p><p>- the development of analytics and detection technologies and</p><p>- the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.</p><p>As regards Dublin, Revenue actively monitors the illegal tobacco trade and has identified certain areas as particular black spots for the sale of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue is currently engaged in an ongoing range of measures targeting those involved. Officers routinely conduct high visibility patrols aimed at disrupting the sale and supply of tobacco products in areas in question.<i> </i>  In November 2012, Revenue increased the number of patrols in the areas concerned.  Revenue&rsquo;s presence in these areas has also been bolstered by the deployment of both the tobacco dog unit and marked vehicles during certain targeted operations.  In 2012, 5 cases were referred for prosecution in relation to illegal trading in tobacco products in the city centre.  Revenue expects a number of further prosecutions for such cases to come before the courts in 2013.</p><p>Moreover, in tandem with ongoing high visibility patrols of the area, Revenue personnel are actively engaged in covert surveillance and test purchasing for the purpose of   gathering intelligence with a view to identifying and prosecuting the suppliers of illicit tobacco products in the areas concerned. A recent example of such a successful intelligence-driven operation involved officers from Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service at Dublin Port seizing some 713,000 cigarettes, with an estimated retail value of &euro;314,575 and a potential loss to the Exchequer of &euro;253,257, from a lock up garage in the Dublin North City area.</p><p>In the particular context of the Dublin Fingal area, I am advised by the Commissioners that their officers will be conducting a number of operations in the coming months specifically targeted at market selling. Revenue has built close links with business interest groups representing retailers with a view to identifying specific locations (including locations within Fingal) where there has been an appreciable fall off in the sale of tobacco and cigarettes and then targeting operations to identify the illegal sale of tobacco and cigarettes in those areas.</p><p>At a national level, interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The relevant agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organized crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.</p><p>Considerable success has been achieved by Revenue in combating the illegal trade. Details of the quantities of cigarettes seized each year since 2005 are set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Quantity of<br />Cigarettes sized<br />(millions)</th></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>51.3</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>52.3</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>74.5</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>135.2</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>218.5</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>178.4</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>109.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>95.6</td></tr></table></p><p>The quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures. For example, the quantity of cigarettes seized in 2009 includes one exceptional   seizure of some 120 million cigarettes that were uncovered on a vessel at Greenore, Co. Louth.</p><p>Moreover, the Revenue Commissioners have had considerable success in detecting and prosecuting persons involved in the illicit trade. For example, in 2012, there were 57 convictions for tobacco smuggling, resulting in 26 custodial sentences being handed down by the Courts (of which 7 were suspended) as well as fines totalling &euro;93,550. In addition, there were a further 75 convictions connected with the sale or keeping for sale of unstamped tobacco products, resulting in 21 custodial sentences (14 of which were suspended) as well as fines of &euro;153,050.</p><p>Revenue is committed to ensuring that the highest possible levels of seizures of illicit products are achieved on an ongoing basis, and that those responsible for the smuggling, supply or selling of illicit products are prosecuted, and will ensure that this work continues to have the high priority that has been accorded to it to date.</p></reply>

The Government has assigned responsibility to the Revenue Commissioners for all aspects of the administration of LPT including where necessary collection enforcement against individuals who choose not to pay.  It is important to note that LPT has been designed as a tax that is easy to pay but difficult to avoid and a range of payment options has been made available for liable owners.  Also, certain properties are exempt from LPT and a system of deferral arrangements is available where there is inability to pay and certain specified conditions are met.  All of these details are set out in Revenue&rsquo;s information booklet &lsquo;Your Guide to Local Property Tax&rsquo;.</p><p>  Where there is non-engagement by liable owners, Revenue will take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the law.  Revenue has a range of options available in this regard and will, in line with standard collection enforcement procedure take the appropriate measures that are considered necessary to pursue full compliance as effectively as possible. In this regard, Revenue will deduct LPT at source from non-compliers where possible. This will prevent arrears building up.</p><p>  Referral of unpaid LPT liabilities to the Sheriff is one such option that is available to Revenue.  Such referrals will only be made where the liable person has not paid the tax by the due date and has not positively engaged with Revenue in regard to the outstanding debt.  The execution of certificates issued by Revenue to Sheriffs in respect of unpaid tax debts (including LPT) is governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debt of all kinds.  Sheriffs operate independently of Revenue and are Officers of the Court, who hold office under section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945. A Sheriff&rsquo;s debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926 as amended, which allows that where necessary the Sheriff may enter any dwelling house or other building for the purpose of seizing goods, that are not exempt under the Act, in execution of a warrant. However, it should be noted that the Sheriff will only commence seizure proceedings as a last resort where there is no positive engagement by the liable person. In circumstances where there is positive engagement by the liable person the Sheriff will work to agree an alternative arrangement.</p></reply>

The targets should provide a better measure of progress on a more consistent basis and promote a movement away from &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; forbearance measures which are not sustainable in the long term. In addition the banks will also be set specific, non-public, targets, principally in relation to handling of early arrears cases. The Central Bank is working with individual institutions to incorporate these measures which will be set in line with each institution&rsquo;s capacity, processes and systems. These targets will be adjusted quarterly to ensure they are ambitious. </p><p>  The banks will be required to publish their performance against the targets and make quarterly reports to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank will consider each bank&rsquo;s performance against the targets, including assessing whether the modifications provided are in fact sustainable solutions.</p><p>  The split mortgage is one of a number of arrangements suggested by the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group Report (the Keane Report).  The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that the majority of lenders have introduced, or are in the process of introducing, a split mortgage arrangement.  The concept involves splitting a distressed mortgage into an affordable mortgage and warehousing the balance. While lenders have taken the broad approach set out in the Keane report, the product details vary from lender to lender. The most notable difference involves the interest rate charged on the warehoused element of the split mortgage varying from 0% up to the full mortgage interest rate. Also, the maximum amount that can be warehoused is dependent on each lender&rsquo;s own internal criteria. The split mortgage, like all other forbearance and modification arrangements, is based on affordability and sustainability of the arrangement from both the borrower and the lender&rsquo;s perspective. </p></reply>

This range of options available means that property owners can choose a method of payment that suits their particular circumstances.  For those wishing to pay in cash, they can pay weekly, monthly or they can pay the charge in a single payment, using one of three approved payment service providers, who are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.</p><p>  I am further informed that the LPT booklet that issued to all property owners along with the recent general issue of LPT Returns includes detailed guidance on each payment option and sets out what steps the property owner must take when making payments.  I understand that the LPT booklet explains at page 7 that cash payments can be made in full.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners also advise that although the paper LPT Return form only provides the option to pay LPT by cash in weekly or monthly instalments, liable persons wishing to pay their LPT liability in cash, should choose either the weekly or monthly option on the LPT Return, even where they intend to make one lump sum payment in cash.  This way the Revenue Commissioners, when processing the LPT Return, will be made aware of the owner&rsquo;s payment preference.  I am further advised that where a liable person wishes to pay their LPT in full using cash, all payment service providers have been informed to accept the lump sum payment and I understand that some property owners have already paid in full using cash via An Post.  Although the option to pay in full by cash is not included on the LPT Return, I am satisfied that this should not impede a property owner who wishes to pay their LPT charge this way and liable persons are already doing so.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that it was not possible to include the names of the three payment service providers on the LPT Return or in the booklet, as negotiations with these service providers were still ongoing when these documents were being produced.  When the negotiations were successfully completed, Revenue published the names of the three payment service providers on the Revenue website.  In addition, Revenue has also been working closely with the Citizens Information Service to optimise the opportunities for property owners, particularly the elderly and those without internet access, to obtain advice on LPT (including the names of the payment service providers) and assistance in completing their LPT Return.  In addition, Revenue had a number of meetings, in advance of the general issue of Returns, with organisations representing Older Persons, where the question of whether An Post would accept LPT payments was discussed and clarified.  Furthermore, Revenue has sought to use all opportunities in interviews with various sections of the media to advise property owners of where they could pay their LPT in cash.</p><p>  Finally, I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have put a significant amount of information into the public domain on payment options and both the LPT Return and booklet covers this in some detail.  It is also open to any property owner who has a query on any aspect of the various payment options to call Revenue&rsquo;s dedicated LPT Helpline on 1890 200255.</p></reply>

Intensive discussions were held with our European partners and particularly President Trichet of the ECB in the run-up to the announcement of our stress tests on 31st March 2011. At that time the President believed that such action was not in the interests of Ireland or the Euro Area. This matter was discussed again with President Trichet on a number of occasions including the Ecofin meeting in Poland in September 2011.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has advised me that as of 18th February 2011, the total unguaranteed senior debt issued by the covered institutions was &euro;36,452m of which &euro;20,039m was unguaranteed senior secured and &euro;16,413m was unguaranteed senior unsecured (This information was published to the Central Bank of Ireland website in April 2011).</p><p>  Within these figures, the amount outstanding at Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide combined was &euro;3,748m (unguaranteed senior unsecured), while there was no senior unguaranteed secured notes in issue.  As the Deputy is aware, burden sharing was thus restricted to junior debt, which over the course of the crisis contributed over &euro;15bn in capital to the Covered Institutions.</p></reply>

In the first instance, a liability for Local Property Tax (LPT) will arise where a person owns a residential property which is in use, or is suitable for use as a dwelling, on the liability date which will be 1 May 2013 for the year 2013.     Where construction of a house is not completed until after 1 May 2013, the residential property will not be liable for LPT until 2017.  However, where a house was constructed before 1 May 2013, it will be subject to LPT whether or not it is occupied.  Under the 2012 Act, such a property may qualify for an exemption from LPT where the house has been constructed for a first time buyer during 2013 and they occupy the house as their sole or main residence.  The exemption will apply until the end of 2016. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as LPT is a self-assessed tax, if a residential property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, the liable person is obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners as soon as possible after they receive their LPT Return, outlining why they consider a charge to LPT does not arise on the property and they must include relevant supporting documentation.  </p><p>  I am further advised by Revenue that, by virtue of the principles of self-assessment, the onus is on the owners of newly constructed residential properties, that are in use as a dwelling, or suitable for use as a dwelling, on 1 May 2013, to file an LPT Return by 7 May 2013 if they are filing on paper or, by 28 May 2013, if filing electronically, even if they have not been issued with an LPT Return form by the Revenue Commissioners.  This may arise where the property, because it is recently constructed, is not recorded on Revenue&rsquo;s LPT Register at the time of the general issue of LPT Returns.  In these circumstances, the property owner should contact Revenue&rsquo;s LPT Helpline at 1890 200255 for assistance or access the online system on Revenue&rsquo;s website to file their LPT Return.  I have been advised by the Commissioners that even where a property owner has not received a Property ID and PIN code from Revenue, they will still be able to file their Return online.</p></reply>

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership. </p><p>  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.  Tackling the cost base is of course only one of many goals that need to be achieved but combined with other measures will deliver the required results. </p><p>  I, and the Government, acknowledge that the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognise that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.  However, it can never be forgotten by management and employees of these banks &ndash; both past and present &ndash; that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived and that this needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.  If remuneration costs are to be reduced with the aim of a return to profitability then sacrifices at all employees levels will be required. </p></reply>

An individual may pay <i>no income tax</i>   on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero. </p><p>2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate. </p><p>3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment. </p><p>4. An individual may pay income tax on their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.   </p><p>  The extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  If there is no other income besides the social welfare payment, the basic personal credits in force can be expected, in most cases, to ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself, provided the credits have not been transferred to a husband or civil partner. </p><p>  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned. </p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. </p></reply>

I would like to clarify that this relief only applies where the adaptation work increases the market value of the property.  Section 15A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.  The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where adaptation work has increased the chargeable value of a property, as LPT is a self-assessed tax, the liable person him or herself determines the reduction in the chargeable value of the property and calculate the revised chargeable value and decides which value band is relevant to the property.  In common with all other liable persons, he or she should then include the appropriate valuation band on their LPT Return, select a payment preference,  and submit the return to Revenue, online or in paper.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that because LPT is a self assessed tax, the liable person does not need to submit any supporting documentation to Revenue when filing their LPT Return.  All relevant supporting documentation to support the reduction in the property&rsquo;s chargeable value should, however, be retained by the liable person in the event that Revenue decides to check the validity of the claim at a later stage as part of its normal compliance programme.  </p><p>  In that regard, I am further advised that supporting documentation would not include medical details of the disabled person but would include, for example, evidence of: </p><p>- Receipt of local authority grant or approval for grant</p><p>- Scheme under which grant received</p><p>- Carrying out of adaptation work</p><p>- Details of work carried out</p><p>- Cost of adaptation work.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  The chargeable value is defined in the 2012 Act and means the price that the unencumbered fee simple of a residential property might be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market were that property to be sold on the valuation date of 1 May 2013, in a manner that would secure the best possible price for the property.  Therefore, in assessing the market value of a residential property no account may be taken of any encumbrance on the property. </p><p>  The 2012 Act also provides that a liability for LPT will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which will be 1 May 2013 for the year 2013 and for subsequent years, 1 November in the preceding year.  I would like to clarify that where an individual has a long-term right of residence (for life or for 20 years or more) that entitles him or her to exclude any other person from the property, he or she would be considered to be the liable person in respect of the property.  Consequently, in the example you have provided, it would appear that the person with the right of residence for the remainder of his or her life may be the liable person for the residential property in question.</p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.    The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for a number of specific exemptions from the charge as well as the possibility of deferring the charge in certain cases of hardship. </p><p>  A requirement to pay management fees is not relevant in determining liability.    Accordingly, whilst those who are liable for management fees to property management companies may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific exemption for the payment of management fees.  I have no plans to introduce such an exemption.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  Liability to management fees and the scale of the fees due would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property. </p><p>  Revenue from the LPT will accrue to local authorities and will support the provision of local services.

In this respect, services provided by the coach and bus sector are exempt from VAT.  This means that a person who provides a bus or coach service does not register for VAT and does not charge VAT on the supply of their services.  This also includes the hiring of a bus or coach with a driver.  Persons who are exempt from VAT cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services incurred in relation to their business, such as fuel, tyres and mechanic charges, used for the purposes of the person&rsquo;s coach and bus service.    UK passenger transport operators who establish their businesses in Ireland are subject to the same VAT rules as Irish operators. They are exempt from VAT and not zero-rated, and as such not entitled to deductibility in respect of VAT incurred on items such as fuel.  In addition, UK passenger transport operators who are not established in the State are not entitled to any refund of VAT incurred in this State for the purposes of carrying out passenger transport activities, whether that service takes place wholly or partially in the State or whether it takes place wholly outside the State.  I, therefore, cannot agree that a significant competitive advantage is being handed to operators in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  VAT law in Ireland and the UK must comply with the EU VAT Directive.  As passenger transport was exempt in Ireland on 1 January 1978, it is possible under the VAT Directive to continue to apply that exemption.  As passenger transport services were charged at the zero rate in the UK on 1 January 1991, the UK are entitled to continue to apply a zero rate to passenger transport services. It is not possible under EU law for Ireland to apply a zero rate to such services as we did not apply a zero rate to them in 1991. </p><p>  With regard to applying the 9% VAT rate to the supply of passenger transport services, I would point out that while it is possible under the EU VAT Directive to introduce a charge to VAT, at a reduced rate, on passenger transport services, Ireland has traditionally exempted such activity from VAT and this reduces the cost of those services for both the providers and the users of transport, including public transport.  What must be remembered is that the cost of goods and services supplied by persons who are exempt from VAT is always lower than if those persons were subject to VAT, despite the fact that they cannot claim VAT on their inputs.</p></reply>

If the property is sold or transferred any outstanding LPT charges would have to be satisfied at that point. The interest will be charged on the deferred amounts from the due date of payment until such time as it is paid, at a daily rate of 0.011%, which equates to 4% per annum. </p></reply>

In relation to the fourth quarter figure, the decline was very modest, and does not show up at the first decimal point.   Importantly, the same statistical release shows that domestic demand stabilised in the second half of 2012, with growth in consumer spending for the first time since 2010.

The main downside risks to this forecast remain beyond our control and relate to the external environment as well as some sector specific issues.

A more prolonged downturn in our key international markets would negatively impact upon our export performance.

The possibility of early repayment of IMF loans has not been pursued as an early repayment of IMF funds would trigger automatic mandatory proportional repayments to the EFSF, EFSM, United Kingdom, Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of Denmark. In addition the debt market does not contemplate a scenario whereby the entire IMF debt stock would be replaced by government bonds in addition to the amounts already signalled to fund the Exchequer deficit and to replace existing redemptions. Such a prospect would be likely to cause significant upward movement in yields or fail to find sufficient investors to absorb such large concentrated debt issuance. </p><p>  The question of early repayment of any one lender cannot be treated in isolation from other lenders and market expectations, and therefore does not arise as a realistic prospect. </p></reply>

The disposal of these shares took place in two tranches. The first disposal for &euro;0.24 billion settled on 2 August 2011 with the second, and final, tranche for &euro;0.81 billion settling on 17 October 2011. This stake represents a shareholding of approx. 35% of the equity in BOI.   As a consequence of this disposal, the State&rsquo;s gross investment in BOI peaked at &euro;4.7bn which was &euro;1.0bn lower than it otherwise would have been. From a net investment point of view, the State received circa &euro;0.5bn for its warrants in 2010 which were originally attached to our preference shares, and in January 2013 the State also successfully disposed of the &euro;1.0 billion Contingent Capital instruments in Bank of Ireland for a profit of &euro;10m.

Taking all these into account to calculate what could be called a net cash position with the bank, the figure is nearer &euro;1.1bn and I am confident that Bank of Ireland will ultimately repay this remaining amount to the taxpayer.</p></reply>

The primary driver of this increase was a reduction in discount rates due to the significant fall in yields on high-quality corporate bonds rather than the underlying scheme assets which actually appreciated in value.   It is my understanding that the Chief Executive Officer of the bank is currently in discussions with his staff and the pension trustees regarding options to address the pension deficit. I will await the outcome of these discussions, however, I do not envisage the State having to inject more capital into the bank as a result.</p></reply>

Such payments are a matter for the Special Liquidators and I have no role in the initiation or authorisation of these payments.    As the Deputy is aware, the legislation surrounding liquidation ranks employees as preferential creditors in respect of certain amounts owing to them on a winding up, including accrued wages and salaries, holiday pay, sick pay, statutory redundancy, pensions contributions and claims for damages arising from accidents. Any claims over and above that described above will rank as an unsecured claim in the liquidation process.</p><p>  There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules by way of the use of Section 9 of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013 or otherwise. Such interference could have the impact of diverting the assets of IBRC from one category of creditor to another outside the normal Companies Acts priorities. Any such interference would be open to challenges in the Irish Courts by unsecured creditors.  </p><p>  The Special Liquidators have advised that there is on-going interaction between the IBOA and the Special Liquidators.  The Special Liquidators have indicated that they are highly cognisant of the issues that the IBOA have been highlighting and that significant steps have already been taken to address those concerns including the announcement on Tuesday 19 March by the Special Liquidators that contracts of staff would be extended out to 7 August with one month&rsquo;s notice thereafter.

Individuals who have an interest in a property that is related to a NAMA loan are encouraged therefore to make direct contact with the owner of the property or, in the case of property that is subject to enforcement, with the appointed receiver.  NAMA advises that all enforced properties securing its loans are listed on its website, www.nama.ie, along with the details of the appointed receiver. Where interested parties contact NAMA directly, the Agency will work to facilitate engagement with the debtor or receiver.   I am advised by NAMA that, in the case of enforced properties, it is a matter for the Receiver to assess any proposals made by prospective purchasers and to make recommendations to NAMA in relation to such proposals.  NAMA advises that irrespective of whether a property is listed for sale or not, a Receiver will as a matter of course consider any approaches from interested parties and will assess all proposals on their merits.   In many instances, after receiving such approaches, sales agents have been appointed to market the property and to deal with offers from the original bidder and other interested parties.  This is in line with NAMA&rsquo;s requirement that properties securing its loans should be, wherever feasible, openly marketed.  Where it is decided however that the proposal is premature or unacceptable, the Receiver will advise the interested party of this and the status of the property in terms of readiness for sale.  NAMA advises that there are myriad reasons why a property might not be available for sale at any point in time.  For example, the Receiver may be working through outstanding title defect or ownership, planning and compliance issues or the commercial strategy may be to rent a property rather than to sell it now in order to maximise its long-term recoverable value. In all instances, the Receiver will take appropriate steps to maximise the value of the asset and the strategy in relation to the asset and the timing of any sale will be geared towards achieving this.  NAMA have advised me that where a person makes an offer to a Receiver and they have not received an acknowledgement, they are welcome to submit such an offer to Head of Asset Recovery, NAMA who will discuss the matter with the Receiver.</p></reply>

The appointment of Jeremy Masding as CEO in February 2012 began an overdue process of fundamental restructuring in PTSB.  Amongst many actions taken during 2012 the senior management team was restructured, an asset management unit was established, branches were closed, a voluntary redundancy scheme was completed and Irish Life and PTSB Finance were sold.  During the same period PTSB agreed a strategic direction with the Troika and delivered on the restructuring actions required in its Restructuring Plan.</p><p>  I will now comment on some elements of the financial accounts, which are laid out in significantly more detail in the recently published annual report for 2012.</p><p>  While high deposit rates eroded net interest margin in 2012, I am satisfied that management took action to address this issue in the latter part of 2012 which should result in an improved net interest margin in 2013. Reduced deposit rates are required for a sustained profitable Irish banking system.</p><p>  PTSB also reduced its homeloan Standard Variable Rate (SVR) to bring it in line with market rates for this type of product. As the Deputy will appreciate, this had a negative impact on net interest margin in 2012 but had a positive impact for SVR customers. </p><p>  While operating costs were somewhat lower in 2012, restructuring actions taken in 2012 should have an additional positive impact in 2013.  With regard to staff costs, which are a subset of operating costs, I have issued instructions to PTSB to develop a plan to deliver savings of 6-10% on its payroll and pension costs. </p><p>  Provisions for impairments were high as mortgage arrears continued to rise, from already high levels, and resulting from an in-depth independent review of its Commercial Real Estate (&ldquo;CRE&rdquo;) loan book.  Management took action early in 2012 to address the significant operational issues in its arrears management operations and I expect that these improvements will allow PTSB to significantly increase the volume of sustainable long term treatments offered to customers in 2013, as required by Government and the Central Bank.  In addition PTSB outsourced the servicing of its CRE loan book to Certus, a contract which will significantly increase the resources and expertise allocated to this loan book. </p><p>  On the balance sheet the funding position of PTSB improved during 2012 with Monetary Authority funding reduced by &euro;3.3 billion including the elimination of ELA of &euro;2.3 billion.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that included in the results are payments to the State.  During 2012 PTSB accrued ELG costs of &euro;165 million and paid interest of &euro;40 million on the Convertible Contingent Capital Notes. </p><p>  In summary the results highlight many of the issues in our banking system which require attention and while it will be challenging to achieve a full resolution of all legacy issues in PTSB, I am satisfied that the new management team have made progress in 2012, which combined with their ambitious restructuring plans for 2013, should deliver concrete results particularly regarding improved profitability and delivery of sustainable treatments for customers in mortgage distress.  My officials will continue to monitor progress in PTSB closely. </p></reply>

Therefore during 2012 Permanent TSB grew its deposits by &euro;2.27 billion.  However the Deputy is correct to observe that PTSB experienced a reduction in deposits during H2 2012.  PTSB has indicated that the reduction in deposits arose due to outflows driven primarily by the strategic repricing of deposit rates downwards.  While outflows occurred, they were significantly less than forecast by PTSB.  As the Deputy will appreciate reducing deposit rates is key for the return of sustainable profitability in the Irish banking system.  </p></reply>

The size of the domestic banking system, at 7 times GDP, was large in relation to the real economy, while at the same time concentrating risks in particular areas and in specific banks.  In contrast the Irish banking system attracted wholesale funding, from a diversified pool of investors (European, British, American and Rest of World) to support lending to the domestic economy to finance investment which was predominantly focused in Ireland (albeit some Irish banks had significant investments overseas).  </p><p>  In addition, overseas banks made substantial investments in Irish banking subsidiaries to gain exposure to the domestic economy and to extend credit to Irish businesses and households.</p><p>  For these reasons, it is clear that the Irish banking system and Cypriot banking system are not comparable.</p></reply>

This Register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to ensure, as far as possible, that all property owners will be contacted.  On 11 March this year, Revenue commenced the issue of LPT Returns to owners of 1.66 million properties.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that by 10 April, LPT Returns had issued for about 96% of residential properties on the Register. </p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore liable persons are obliged to calculate the tax due based on their assessment of the market value of their property, file their Return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  This obligation applies to all owners whether or not they receive a Return from Revenue.  Where an owner is not on Revenue&#8217;s Register a Return will not issue.  However, they are still obliged to complete and file a Return by the relevant deadline (7 May for paper filers and 28 May for electronic filers).  </p><p>  As part of its media campaign Revenue will advise property owners this week that, if they have not yet received a Return from Revenue, they should contact Revenue&#8217;s LPT Helpline on 1890 200 255 or access the online system on Revenue&#8217;s website to file their LPT Return.  I have been advised by the Commissioners that even where a property owner has not received a Property ID and PIN code from Revenue, they will still be able to file their Return online.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, LPT is payable on 1 July, and Revenue has put in place a wide range of payment options to enable liable persons to select the one that best suits their circumstances, including payment by instalments in various ways.  The logistics of ensuring that paper LPT returns are processed in time to enable the payment arrangements selected by the liable person to be put in place in time for the payment date are significant, and accordingly it is necessary to maintain the filing dates of 7 May for paper filers.  The filing date of 28 May for online filers is the <i>defacto</i>   extension. </p><p>  The LPT paper return is very short &#8211; just two pages.  The on-line system is easier than paper, with built in prompts and calculators.  In either case it will be possible for liable persons to quickly complete and submit a return. </p><p>  I can confirm that I have no plans to extend the deadline for submitting Local Property Tax returns beyond the dates mentioned.</p></reply>

However, for the purpose of this reply, I am assuming that the Deputy&rsquo;s interest relates to the most recent changes that were introduced in Finance Acts 2009 and 2013. </p><p>  Finance Act 2009 introduced a cap of 75% on the amount of interest on loans used to purchase, improve or repair rented residential property, that can be deducted in computing rental profit for tax purposes. The restriction applies to interest accruing on or after 7 April 2009. It does not apply to loans in respect of rented commercial  property.</p><p>  The recent amendment in Finance Act 2013 provides that, while income chargeable to tax under Case III of Schedule D (which includes income arising outside the State such as trading profits, pensions, rents and dividends) is deemed to issue from a single source, the single source provision cannot be taken to mean that foreign rental losses are to be included in the computation of such income. This change was designed to ensure that the recipient of rent from property lettings outside the State cannot rely on the single source provision to offset foreign rental losses against foreign non-rental income. The offset of losses in these circumstances would disadvantage a recipient of rent from Irish property, as Irish rental losses may be offset against Irish rental profits only. In that regard, I am also advised by the Commissioners that the Revenue&rsquo;s published practice in relation to the treatment of foreign rental losses, which allows such losses to be set against foreign rental profits, remains unchanged.</p><p>  I am further advised that rental profit for tax purposes is the gross rental income less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent. In computing the amount of rental profit, only those deductions that are specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are allowable as deductions against the gross rental income. The main deductible expenses are:</p><p>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>- the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration </p><p>     requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and </p><p>  - payment of local authority rates. </p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p></reply>

I am sure the staff will continue to work to ensure a satisfactory outcome for Irish taxpayers while they remain in employment under the liquidation process.  Furthermore, some staff may, in time, be re-hired by NAMA or other purchasers of the assets.</p><p>  There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules. Such interference could have the impact of diverting the assets of IBRC from one category of creditor to another outside the normal Companies Acts priorities. Any such interference would be open to challenges in the Irish Courts by unsecured creditors.  However the State does intervene to ensure that statutory redundancy is available through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to EUR600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators have advised that there is ongoing interaction between the IBOA and the Special Liquidators.  The Special Liquidators are highly cognisant of the issues that the IBOA have been highlighting and that significant steps have already been taken to address those concerns including the announcement on Tuesday 19 March by the Special Liquidators that contracts of staff would be extended out to 7 August with one month&rsquo;s notice thereafter.  This should provide some reassurance to IBRC staff relative to the common position in liquidations where staff contracts are terminated on liquidation.</p></reply>

However, it is my understanding that since 2010 dental treatment which is covered as a result of being a PRSI contributor has been limited to a free oral examination per year.  Prior to 2010, a range of dental treatments were covered in part or full for individuals that had made the requisite PRSI contributions. For example, the cost associated with scaling and polishing of teeth was fully covered whereas extractions, fillings and x-rays of teeth were partially covered. However, I understand that orthodontic treatment or cosmetic dentistry were never covered under the PRSI scheme.   </p><p>  Health expenses relief was standard rated in respect of health expenses incurred from 1 January 2009, with the exception of nursing home expenses where marginal relief continues to apply.    The measure was introduced to make the tax system more equitable and fairer for all taxpayers and also to reduce the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer.</p><p>  Given the current budgetary constraints, I have no plans to re-introduce marginal tax relief in respect of orthodontic treatment and other selected specialist dental treatments. </p></reply>

The results also show that the bank posted operating losses, before exceptional items, of &euro;2.8 billion in 2012 &ndash; an improvement of 65% over 2011 where operating losses of &euro;8.1 billion were recorded.  The full year 2012 loss (including exceptional losses such as deleveraging) before tax was &euro;3.8bn (compared to &euro;5.1bn in 2011).</p><p>  The size of the losses highlight the scale of the challenges facing the bank, however, it is essential that the management continue to reduce costs and return the bank to profitability on behalf of the shareholders &ndash; the Irish taxpayer.  This is why the Government has sought a reduction of 6-10% in payroll costs following the Review of Remuneration Practice and Frameworks at the Covered Institutions.</p><p>  Dealing effectively with customers in difficulties must be prioritised in 2013 and the new Central Bank targets on mortgage arrears will ensure that the banks take real steps to help their customers.</p><p>  The bank must also begin to look forward and to continue to lend to households and businesses.  In this regard I would expect to see SME lending continue on an upward trend.  AIB approved &euro;4.8 billion in SME lending in 2012 &ndash; 37% ahead of the &euro;3.5 billion target.  A lending target of &euro;4 billion has been set this year and I would expect that AIB continue to view this target as a minimum not a maximum.  The bank has also set mortgage lending targets of &euro;2bn for 2013 &ndash; an increase of &euro;500m over new mortgage lending in 2012. </p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that AIB and PTSB's businesses are not directly comparable as AIB provides a range of services to retail, SME and corporate customers while PTSB is a more focused provider of services to retail customers.  In simple terms PTSB is forecast to take longer to reach profitability as the drag of low yielding trackers on its business performance is much more material than in the case of AIB.  In its restructuring plan submitted in June 2012, PTSB forecast that the retail bank Strategic Business Unit would be profitable in 2016, though recent indications are that this could be accelerated.</p></reply>

I have been informed that there are a number of customer accounts that may not be entitled to full compensation under the deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, or the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, ELG, due to the nature of the products or deposit options in which those account holders invested.  At the time that such products were offered there was no additional guarantee provided by the State in respect of those products.  It was always the case that the ELG scheme covered only those liabilities which were entered into during the issuance window. </p><p>  I have been advised that the total value of Irish pension funds placed on deposit with Irish Bank Resolution Corporation at the time of liquidation was in the region of &#8364;1m.  This could exclude any funds placed on deposit with the Bank in client accounts opened on behalf of beneficiaries, where these beneficiaries are Irish pension funds.  The total value of Irish pension fund deposits is currently under review with the respective Guarantee Scheme Operators, regarding consideration for payment under the respective schemes.  The total number of individual pension funds with funds placed on deposit with Irish Bank Resolution Corporation at the time of liquidation was 23.  Again, this could exclude any pension funds who are the beneficiaries of client accounts opened on their behalf.</p><p>  Through the liquidation process, the proceeds from the disposal of IBRC's assets will be used to repay creditors in accordance with normal Companies Acts priorities and consequently, preferred creditors will be paid first and then debt purchased by NAMA from the Central Bank will be paid.  If there are proceeds available after repayment in full of the NAMA debt, these proceeds will be applied to remaining unsecured creditors.  This would include depositors to the extent that their deposits are unguaranteed.</p></reply>

The amending budget proposal is currently under discussion within the Council of Ministers under the Irish Presidency and must be agreed by both the Council and the European Parliament.  As this negotiation is ongoing, it is not possible to prejudge the outcome.  Ireland will contribute approximately 1% of the final amount agreed.

The fact that an agreement has been reached is important, as this will remove uncertainty and generate stability, for Cyprus, for the euro area and for Ireland.  The programme will address the exceptional challenges that Cyprus is facing, with a view to restoring the viability of the banking sector, the soundness of public finances and creating the conditions for sustainable growth and job creation. </p><p>  The details of the programme have been agreed with the Troika.  Some of the elements of the programme have been decided upon by the Cypriot authorities themselves.  The overall strategy involves measures aimed at ensuring a stable, sustainable and transparent financial sector, a fiscal adjustment that balances short-run cyclical concerns and long-run sustainability objectives and a comprehensive programme of structural reforms.</p><p>  Cyprus is a unique case because of the size of its banking sector (7 to 8 times GDP), combined with its structure, level of risk-taking and suboptimal supervision.  Cyprus has also been particularly affected by debt developments in Greece.  So the current measures are tailor-made to the very exceptional situation in Cyprus in order to restore the viability of a smaller banking sector while, at the same time, protecting all deposits below &euro;100,000 in accordance with EU rules.</p></reply>

The Group recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, and, for this reason, the Group suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years.  The Group also considered that it is for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.      </p><p>  The Government accepted the recommendation of the Thornhill Group on this matter.  While there is no provision in the current legislation on the taxation of rental income that deductions in respect of LPT paid are allowable, it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis. </p><p>  Neither the manner in which this will happen or the timing has yet been decided. </p></reply>

A person guilty of this offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine of &euro;5,000.

In cases where marked mineral oil is found in the fuel tank of a commercial vehicle, the normal course would be to proceed by way of the institution of a prosecution under section 102 of the 1999 Act.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property and Revenue will not be involved, as a matter of routine, in valuing individual properties.  </p><p>  For the purposes of LPT, property values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  This means that property owners are not required to provide a precise value for their property but instead must determine the valuation band into which their residential property falls.  I am further advised by the Commissioners that the initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013 will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increases or decreases in the value of properties or, improvements made to the property, over this period.  This will ensure a measure of certainty for all property owners for the next three and a half years. </p><p>  As I have previously advised the House, where a property owner makes their property valuation in an honest and reasonable manner, whether they base that on Revenue&rsquo;s own on-line valuation guide or some other means, that valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter and, consequently, additional charges will not be applied.  By the same token, as property owners are not required to provide a precise value for their property, it is unlikely that any owner would find themselves in the position where they overpay their LPT.  </p><p>  In conclusion, Deputy, I do not consider that there is any anomaly in the LPT regime and I am satisfied that valuations of residential properties, made in good faith by the owner, will be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon.  Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  </p><p>  It should be noted however that businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, in the context of Budget 2013, I provided for relief from excise duty on auto diesel for qualifying road transport and passenger transport operators. </p><p>  There are no plans for further taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. </p></reply>

A Memorandum of Understanding setting out an indicative timeframe was agreed in 2012 by Revenue and HMRC and work on the project is proceeding.  A joint 'Invitation to Make Submissions' (IMS), which issued in June 2012, generated international interest and twelve submissions were received by the closing date.  These submissions are being evaluated jointly at present by Revenue and HMRC on the basis of agreed scientific, legal and operational criteria.  Fuel laundering imposes significant costs on the community and poses a serious threat to tax yield and to legitimate businesses.  As part of its strategy to curb illegal activity in this area, Revenue strengthened licensing requirements for traders in auto fuels in 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  A new licensing requirement was introduced for traders in marked fuel oil from 1 October 2012 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.  In addition, Revenue introduced new supply chain controls requiring all licensed fuel retailers to make monthly returns to Revenue, from 1 January 2013, of their fuel transactions, which will provide assurance about the distribution of all fuels and identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and distribution patterns.</p><p>  In the period 2011 to 2012, over 2 million litres of fuel was seized, 20 fuel laundries were detected and closed and over 89 filling stations were closed because they were unlicensed or in breach of licensing conditions. </p></reply>

In addition, the Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I announced my intention to fulfill the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. </p><p>A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 <i>or</i> if they drew down their mortgage in that period. </p><p>  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones, but I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer, given the significant budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p><p>  Furthermore, it is also worth pointing out that this Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the significant difficulties faced by some home owners in meeting their mortgage obligations.  The Government's strategy is built around four distinct areas &#8211; Personal Insolvency, a Mortgage Advisory Service, the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and Engagement with the banks, significant progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>  As announced recently, the implementation of this strategy has further intensified with the Central Bank now setting time bound and measurable targets for banks on their progress in resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage.  The &quot;Keane Report&quot; has already outlined a number of possible options that can be considered in order to provide a sustainable solution for a mortgage in difficulty on a case by case basis.  </p><p>  The Government recognises that the position of negative equity is a difficult one for some homeowners.  However, a number of steps have been taken to assist those that find themselves in this position.  For example, the Central Bank is allowing banks, in appropriate cases, to provide new mortgages to people to move home even if the homeowner is currently experiencing negative equity. </p><p>  However, in the mortgage area, the main priority for Government relates to the issue of significant mortgage arrears and the objective is, from both a social and economic policy point of view, that home owners who are in mortgage difficulty should be assisted to remain in their homes where feasible and appropriate.  </p><p>  The importance of the work to address the mortgage arrears problem is reflected in the fact that a special Government committee on this issue has been established, which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  However, ultimately the Government is of the view that it is the regeneration of the economy, the restoration of employment levels and income growth that will address the real social and economic problems associated with high levels of mortgage and personal indebtedness.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government focus has been on the introduction of many new initiatives aimed at fostering and generating economic growth.  The successful achievement of this objective will restore consumer confidence and bring the tangible and sustainable recovery that the country requires.</p></reply>

Such interference could have the impact of diverting the assets of IBRC from one category of creditor to another outside the normal Companies Acts priorities.  Any such interference would be open to challenges in the Irish Courts by unsecured creditors.  Notwithstanding the above, the State does intervene to ensure that statutory redundancy is available for IBRC staff through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to EUR600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.</p><p>  I acknowledge the significant efforts and commitment made by the staff in IBRC over the past few difficult years whilst the bank was in wind down and the difficulties that arise for staff as a result of the liquidation but it was necessary to take the decision to liquidate IBRC in the larger public interest.  I am sure the staff will continue to work to ensure a satisfactory outcome for Irish taxpayers while they remain in employment under the liquidation process.  Furthermore, some staff may, in time, be re-hired by NAMA or other purchasers of the assets.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators have advised that there is on-going interaction between the IBOA and the Special Liquidators.  The Special Liquidators have indicated that they are highly cognisant of the issues that the IBOA have been highlighting and that significant steps have already been taken to address those concerns including the announcement on Tuesday 19 March by the Special Liquidators that contracts of staff would be extended out to 7 August with one month's notice thereafter.  This should provide some reassurance to IBRC staff relative to the common position in liquidations where staff contracts are terminated on liquidation.	</p></reply>

A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State.  The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  Data from the various sources has been cross-checked to ensure that the Register is as accurate as possible.  The Register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine it.  </p><p>  I am informed that while every effort has been made to correctly match residential properties to owners, in a small number of cases, some individuals who are renting properties have inadvertently received LPT Returns from Revenue for the property.  One reason for this may be that the landlord of the rented property has not registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  </p><p>  Indeed the possibility of individuals other than owners receiving Returns in error, has been cited by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners in public statements that she has made in connection with the currently ongoing general issue of LPT Returns.  I am further advised that this particular possibility is covered in the letter and the information booklet that accompanies the LPT Return.  The correspondence advises anyone who receives an LPT Return from Revenue, but who is not the liable person in respect of a property, what steps they should take.  It is important that they should not ignore the Return.  </p><p>  Where an individual who is renting a property receives a Return for that property they should advise Revenue in writing that they are not the liable person in respect of the property and provide the relevant supporting documentation, where available.  This will ensure that the LPT Register can be corrected.  I am advised by Revenue that individuals who are receiving LPT Returns in error are advising the Revenue Commissioners, who are updating the Register accordingly. </p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that rather than issuing multiple Returns to owners of multiple properties, a single letter issued to each of these owners instructing them to file their Returns for their properties on-line.  As the Deputy&rsquo;s constituent received a single Return in his or her name from Revenue, this would suggest that it is the only property that Revenue would have identified the constituent in question as the owner of.  However, if the Deputy wishes to supply the details of the constituent, I will pass these on to the Revenue Commissioners, who will check the LPT Register to ensure that this is the case.</p><p>  While it is absolutely regretted that any correspondence issues to the wrong person, given the scale of the operation involved, there was always a likelihood that this would arise in some instances.  I am very satisfied that as part of Revenue&rsquo;s communications around the general issue of LPT Returns, the Commissioners sought to fore-warn taxpayers and they have provided very clear guidance on the steps that should be taken in these cases. </p></reply>

All the relevant details can be found on the Revenue website <i></i> .   Taxable rental income from foreign rental property is generally calculated in the same way as taxable rental income from Irish property, with the same deductions and allowances being available.</p><p>  In that regard, the main deductible expenses available in respect of Irish rental property, as provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, are:</p><p>- any rent payable by a landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>- the cost to a landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>- the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest); and payment of local authority rates.</p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that credit against Irish income tax for property tax paid in respect of property located in a foreign jurisdiction is not available under our double taxation treaties.  In the first instance, credit under a tax treaty is only available in respect of taxes listed in the treaty, and most of Ireland's treaties cover income and capital gains, but not capital taxes.  Secondly, in the relatively small number of Irish tax treaties (less than one in seven) that include provisions on the avoidance of double taxation with respect to capital, the principle adopted by the OECD that credit is to be allowed for income tax only against income tax, and for capital tax only against capital tax, is followed.   This means that, in those tax treaties that itemise property tax in the foreign jurisdiction in the list of taxes covered by the treaty, the double taxation relief provisions in each provide that credit for the property tax will not be given against income tax in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.   Revenue has an enforcement presence at strategic locations throughout the State. Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place.  Revenue adopts a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem of laundered diesel.  Their &#8220;Strategy for Combating the Illegal Trade in Mineral Oils (2011-2013)&#8221;, which is published on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie), includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for laundered diesel. This strategy includes supply chain controls designed to deny fuel launderers access to marked fuel for laundering and to deny them access to the market for laundered fuel. In this work, Revenue is supported by well-established structures to ensure very close cooperation between all relevant agencies north and south of the border. The Cross Border Fuel Fraud Group<i></i>brings together representatives from a number of agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<i>, </i>the Criminal Assets Bureau<i></i>and the PSNI, in addition to the Irish and UK Revenue authorities. There is excellent cooperation between all these agencies in the sharing of intelligence and identification and investigation of the organised criminals involved in this fraud.<font color="#FF0000">   </font>  Measures taken to date include the introduction of a stronger licensing regime for the auto-fuel sector and the introduction of a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders in October 2012.  From January 2013, new reporting requirements have taken effect which require all licensed fuel traders to report their transactions to Revenue on a monthly basis. This supply chain data will enable Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous activity for investigation.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009. Revenue&#8217;s overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581(FTE) at the end of 2008 to its current level of 5,780 (FTE). Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. The Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to the tackling of the illegal trade, including laundered diesel, and they are committed to ensuring that despite the staff reductions that this enforcement work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.  The Deputy will appreciate that for reasons of operational sensitivity the Commissioners are not in a position to provide details or plans of enforcement deployment at any given location.</p></reply>

Section 17 introduces a new section 782A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year window of opportunity to draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of certain AVCs made by them, including additional voluntary PRSA contributions made to AVC PRSAs. Where AVCs are subject to a pension adjustment order, both parties to the order may exercise the option independently in respect of their respective &ldquo;share&rdquo; of the AVCs.</p><p>  The procedures set out in the legislation for exercising the AVC access option are straight forward and I have outlined these hereunder. However, in addition to these procedures, I am aware from discussions which my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had with various pension industry representative bodies, that the administrators of AVC funds will also be putting administrative procedures and systems in place to facilitate the access option at an operational level. I understand that these administrative and systems procedures are in the process of being finalised. </p><p>  The likelihood is, of course, that an individual contemplating availing of the option will firstly contact his pension fund administrator by phone or email to establish what he or she needs to do. In that regard, the legislation requires the individual to give an irrevocable written instruction to the administrator of the fund that he or she wishes to avail of the option. Provided the individual qualifies for the encashment option, the administrator acts on the instruction by determining the value of the AVC fund and paying an amount, not exceeding 30% of the value, to the individual subject to deduction of the appropriate amount of tax. The amount paid is treated as emoluments to which Schedule E applies and tax is collected at source under the PAYE system. The legislation requires the administrator to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. The payments are specifically exempt from USC and PRSI.</p><p>   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in advance of any payment of AVCs being made, the individual exercising the option should contact his or her Revenue Office for a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate Cut-off point in respect of the AVC payment. It may be the case that the pension fund administrator will contact Revenue on behalf of the individual, but where the individual is applying directly to Revenue he or she would need to advise Revenue of the pension fund administrator's registered number (i.e. employer number) so that Revenue can forward the Certificate to the correct administrator. The Certificate will indicate the Standard Rate Cut-off Point and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment and facilitate the deduction of the correct amount of tax by the administrator. </p></reply>

Such a measure could prove costly to the Exchequer. If 10,000 new businesses were created in 2013 the cost of the credit could be &euro;16.5 million, potentially rising to &euro;49.5 million in 2015 if the same number of businesses were created each year. A large portion of this cost could relate to deadweight. </p><p>  It is not clear whether the introduction of such a credit for self-employed individuals would be effective, given that many new businesses are loss-making in the early stages and, as a result, the credit would be unused by many individuals. It is unclear how this tax credit would stimulate business creation, or increase levels of employment. The provision of such a tax credit would not be sufficient in its own right to encourage individuals to take up self-employment.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, in the recent Budget I announced a 10 point tax reform plan to help small business. Many of the measures contained in this plan are available to entrepreneurs who start their own business, including a 3 year corporation tax relief for start-ups, increasing the VAT cash receipts threshold and extending the Employment and Investment Incentive and Seed Capital Scheme.</p></reply>

The &#8220;two-pack&#8221; is currently undergoing the jurist linguists process which finalises the regulations in all official languages and it is expected that they will be formally adopted in May or June.</p><p>  One of the regulations concerning common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans includes the following requirements:</p><p>- the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by the 15th of October each year; </p><p>- draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all Euro area Member States not in a programme of assistance;</p><p>- the draft budget must be based on independent macroeconomic forecasts which are defined as forecasts produced or endorsed by an independent body; and</p><p>- the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by the 31st of December each year.</p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government has decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before the 15th of October from now on. This means that Budget 2014 will be presented on Tuesday, the 15th of October this year.</p><p>  The Government has also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by the 31st of December each year. This timeline will be considerably shorter than the present requirement that it must be enacted within 120 days of the Budget. Under the new arrangements, the Finance Bill will have to be passed 65 to 70 days after the Budget.</p><p>  Following the Government decision on the timing of the budget, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are considering the follow-on implications of moving both Budget Day and the Finance Bill forward.  It is the intention of both Departments to keep all bodies that contribute to the Budget and Finance Bill processes fully informed of changes so that they can plan accordingly.</p><p>  The decision on implementation of the independent macroeconomic forecasts is still under consideration. Furthermore, the Government will decide later in the budgetary process whether to submit a draft budgetary plan in the common format as Ireland is exempt from this requirement because it is in a programme.</p><p>  With regards to the operational budgetary process, the Deputy should be aware that there have been numerous European developments over the past few years including strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact through the six-pack, the Fiscal Stability Treaty and continuing with the two-pack as outlined above. The impacts of all of these are taken into account.</p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy should also note that my colleague, Mr. Brendan Howlin T.D., the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has implemented significant changes on the Expenditure side of the Budget including the introduction of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, which includes multi-annual expenditure ceilings, the extension of the performance budgeting initiative, including the introduction of <i>IrelandStat</i>   and the introduction of a public spending code.</p></reply>

The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative introduced in May 2011. The Jobs Initiative contains a range of measures aimed at assisting in employment generation &ndash; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.    Amounts received from the pension fund levy are paid into the Exchequer central fund.  Central fund is made up of tax revenue, non-tax revenue and borrowing. These funds are used in the day-to-day running of the State and it is therefore extremely difficult to quantify which specific funds are used for which purpose. That said, it is possible to cost the measures contained in the Jobs Initiative and examine their effect on the relevant sectors. </p><p>  As part of the Jobs Initiative, a new reduced rate of VAT at 9%, with effect from 1st of July 2011 until 31st December 2013, was introduced. This reduced rate targeted services and goods relating to the employment intensive tourism sector. This measure was estimated to cost the Exchequer &euro;470 million in reduced VAT receipts by end 2012.</p><p>  Upon assessment of this measure in late 2012, contained in the Medium Term Fiscal Statement, it was shown that there was significant pass through of the VAT reduction to tourism related goods and services.  It can reasonably be inferred that this policy measure has contributed to the employment growth evident in the food and accommodations services sector since the measure was introduced.</p><p>  One way to help job creation and improve our labour cost competitiveness is to ease the costs on employers of taking on new employees. Accordingly, the Jobs Initiative announced the lowering of employers PRSI for lower paid employment until end 2013. PRSI initiatives were estimated to cost over &euro;303m in the two years to 2012.</p><p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s priority of fostering growth and creating jobs, the Finance Bill 2012 gave effect to measures supporting employment for both the FDI and SME sectors. These measures included a special assignee relief programme to encourage foreign companies to invest in Ireland, a foreign earnings deduction to assist the expansion into emerging markets and changes to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme to aid the SME sector. These measures are estimated to cost the Exchequer &euro;16 million on a yearly basis. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, a significant portion of the policies contained in the Jobs Initiative are related to labour market activation and capital projects. The Governments strategy on labour market activation &ndash; Pathways to Work &ndash; strives to ensure that, as employments opportunities materialize through the Jobs Initiative, as many of these jobs as possible are filled from the live register &ndash; with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long term unemployment. In addition, the Job Bridge internship programme gives employers the opportunity to provide valuable work experience to the unemployed and as an added benefit gives employers the ability to assess the suitability of individuals for future employment.</p><p>   As noted, the Jobs Initiative will also allow for various capital projects to take place, creating further employment opportunities. For example, capital funding was made available for 374 primary and post primary school building projects. As stated at the launch of the Jobs Initiative, this investment alone will create approximately 2400 direct and 480 indirect jobs in the construction sector over the life of the initiative.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to emphasise the point that the impact of the Jobs Initiative, as specified on announcement day, will be budgetary neutral.</p></reply>

It is only by addressing our current fiscal imbalances that we will be able to return to sustainable economic growth and job creation. As the Deputy will be aware, there remains a considerable gap between revenue generated and expenditure. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirement to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015 as per the Excessive Deficit Procedure, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.   It should also be noted that while the necessary consolidation can have a negative short-run impact on economic output, the Government is pursuing fiscal consolidation in a manner that minimises the impact on the economy.</p><p>  My Department will publish revised macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts at the end of this month as part of the Stability Programme Update 2013.

Chapter 14 of the Revenue booklet &#8216; Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217; sets out in detail the various property types that are exempt from LPT. From the information provided by the Deputy, the person in question does not qualify for any exemption as provided for in the Act.    If the person in question is concerned about his/her ability to pay LPT in a single payment then he/she may want to consider using one of the phased payment options that spreads payment in instalments across the year. The various payment options including phased cash payments and direct debit arrangements are detailed in &#8216;Chapter 11&#8217; of the Revenue booklet &#8216; Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217;. For example, LPT can be deducted at source on a phased basis from salaries or occupational pensions or from certain payments from the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Revenue Commissioners advise that where deduction at source is chosen, there is no additional administration or interest charge. Payments can also be made by direct debit from current accounts in banks and other financial institutions including credit unions. Finally, liable persons can avail of phased payment facilities through third party payment service providers. This option does attract a transactional charge, which is levied by the service provider.</p><p>The Act also provides for circumstances whereby a person may opt to defer or partially defer payment of LPT where certain conditions are met. Chapter 12 of the Revenue booklet &#8216; Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217; sets out in detail the various deferral types that are available. Revenue has also published extensive guidelines on the various types of deferrals, including examples, on its website <i>www.revenue.ie  </i>.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that deferral is not an exemption.  Payment of the tax is deferred, meaning that it becomes payable later and carries an interest charge at a rate of 4% per annum on all amounts of LPT that are deferred. Any deferred amount, including interest, will be a charge on the property and will have to be paid to Revenue on the sale/transfer of the property. </p></reply>

On 13 January 2012, the Central Bank of Ireland secured a High Court Order for the appointment of a Special Manager to Newbridge Credit Union. Further High Court applications were made in June 2012 and January 2013 to extend the term of appointment of the Special Manager and High Court Orders were secured for a 6 month extension period on each occasion.  </p><p>  This action was taken to strengthen Newbridge Credit Union, protect members&rsquo; savings and ensure that Newbridge Credit Union can continue to operate effectively, providing financial services to the local community while ensuring. The Special Manager replaces the management and Board of Newbridge Credit Union and his primary role is to establish the financial position and bring forward a business plan.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that they have discussed with the Special Manager the question of an AGM. The Special Manager has not refused to hold an AGM. However, as the accounts cannot be signed off without a final resolution either completed or substantially completed there would not be any basis to underpin an AGM.  </p><p>  The Special Manager originally had a question and answers document available in the Credit Union and wrote to all members informing them of his appointment and to advise them of his role in Newbridge Credit Union. Updates are provided on the website and he and his team also make themselves available to members. </p><p>  The fees payable to the Special Manager of Newbridge Credit Union are currently subject to an on-going Court process and therefore I cannot provide any specific details at this time. However, the Deputy might note that the hourly rate of fee payable to the Special Manager was reduced from &euro;423 to &euro;375 following an application by the Central Bank of Ireland to the Court on 10 February 2012.  The fees payable to his team were reduced on a pro-rata basis.	</p></reply>

One of the key requirements under the &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo; which will impact on our budgetary process is that the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by the 15th of October each year.   In light of this requirement, the Government has decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before the 15th of October from now on. This means that Budget 2014 will be presented and published on Tuesday, the 15th of October this year. Debates following the presentation of the draft budget will be a matter for the House in the normal way.</p><p>  The Government has also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by the 31st of December each year. This timeline will be considerably shorter than the present requirement that it must be enacted within 120 days of the Budget. Under the new arrangements, the Finance Bill will have to be passed 65 to 70 days after the Budget.</p><p>  Following the Government decision on the timing of the budget, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are considering the follow-on implications of moving both Budget Day and the Finance Bill forward.  It is the intention of both Departments to keep all bodies that contribute to the Budget and Finance Bill processes fully informed of changes so that they can plan accordingly.	</p></reply>

Chapter 14 of the Revenue booklet &#8216; Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217; sets out in detail the various property types that are exempt from LPT. From the information provided by the Deputy, the person in question does not qualify for any exemption as provided for in the Act.   If the person in question is concerned about his/her ability to pay LPT in a single payment then he/she may want to consider using one of the phased payment options that spreads payment in instalments across the year. The various payment options including phased cash payments and direct debit arrangements are detailed in &#8216;Chapter 11&#8217; of the Revenue booklet &#8216; Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217;. For example, LPT can be deducted at source on a phased basis from salaries or occupational pensions or from certain payments from the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Revenue Commissioners advise that where deduction at source is chosen, there is no additional administration or interest charge. Payments can also be made by direct debit from current accounts in banks and other financial institutions including credit unions. Finally, liable persons can avail of phased payment facilities through third party payment service providers. This option does attract a transactional charge, which is levied by the service provider.</p><p>  The Act also provides for circumstances whereby a person may opt to defer or partially defer payment of LPT where certain conditions are met. Chapter 12 of the Revenue booklet &#8216; Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217; sets out in detail the various deferral types that are available. Revenue has also published extensive guidelines on the various types of deferrals, including examples, on its website <i>www.revenue.ie  </i>.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that deferral is not an exemption.  Payment of the tax is deferred, meaning that it becomes payable later and carries an interest charge at a rate of 4% per annum on all amounts of LPT that are deferred. Any deferred amount, including interest, will be a charge on the property and will have to be paid to Revenue on the sale/transfer of the property. </p></reply>

However, the Central Bank has advised me that Banks are expected to propose long-term sustainable solutions to borrowers in arrears to assist them remain in their homes, where feasible These solutions should be suitable and tailored to each individual situation. The Bank would encourage all borrowers to engage with their lender as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) are designed to support and facilitate the finding of an agreeable solution.</p><p>  The current version of the CCMA does not allow a bank to remove a borrower in arrears off a tracker rate but the proposal is if it is to the overall advantage of the borrower, e.g. linked to some debt forgiveness, then a lender may do so.

As Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax, the liable person for a particular property is obliged to determine the market value of the property on 1 May 2013. If there are particular characteristics of the property relating to it being a student residence that would be expected to positively or negatively affect its market value, these should be taken into account in establishing the market value of the property. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, because of the particular ownership arrangements that were put in place to facilitate investment in some of the properties that were constructed under the student accommodation tax incentive scheme, a person may not own an individual residential unit but may instead own a share in all of the residential units in a particular development. This type of &lsquo;co-ownership&rsquo; arrangement does not have any effect on valuation for LPT purposes and each residential unit should be valued separately. However, only one person will be designated by the Revenue Commissioners to submit the LPT Return form and to pay the tax. </p><p>  In cases where the student residences are owned by a college or other educational institution, it is the college that is responsible for valuing the residences and paying the LPT. Again, this has no effect on valuation.</p></reply>

The property is required to be bought during the &ldquo;incentive period&rdquo; from 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2013 and must be held for seven years.  The relief applies to all property, whether residential or non-residential.  </p><p>  The relief does not apply if a property is sold within seven years of its acquisition.  If it is sold more than seven years after acquisition and a gain is made on the sale, relief will be given for the initial seven year holding period.  For example, if the property was bought in January 2012 and sold in January 2022, the property would have been held for ten years, so seven tenths of any gain will be relieved from CGT and three tenths is taxable.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.640.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRL04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 to 350, inclusive, together.</p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 sets out how the tax is to be administered and how a residential property is to be valued for Local Property Tax (LPT) purposes. </p><p>  LPT is a self-assessed tax and as I have advised the House on many occasions, it is a matter for the property owner in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property. For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &#8364;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &#8364;50,000 in each band, so owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.    </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, together with the owner&#8217;s own knowledge of a property, will assist him or her in assessing its value. This guidance should be used together with other sources of information including the Property Services Regulatory Authority&#8217;s property price register, property sections of newspapers, information from local estate agents and property websites. When using Revenue&#8217;s valuation guidance, property owners should consider the specifics of their own property and if they feel that the guidance is not indicating a reasonable valuation, they should make their own assessment.  </p><p>  In the absence of a national residential property valuation system, the valuation guidance developed by Revenue is designed to help property owners in self-assessing the market value of their property by giving them average, indicative values for their area. The guidance is based on sales in the last 3 years and provides a benchmark to help people consider whether their property is more or less valuable than the average in an area. This guidance will be helpful in the majority of cases but there are always properties in an area that differ from the average.</p><p>The valuation guidance explicitly states: &#8220;<i>This service provides a guide to average market values of properties in a given locality and offers an indicative valuation band for properties depending on type, age and location.  It does not provide market values for individual properties</i>  .&#8221; </p><p>  Revenue has made the guidance as simple as possible &#8211; users need only know their property&#8217;s type, age and location. The Revenue valuation guidance website combines two aspects &#8211; a simple point and click option to get an average valuation for an area (electoral district) and an interactive map showing relative valuations across electoral districts.</p><p>  I note the Deputy&#8217;s statement last week on the Revenue guidance and I will take this opportunity to explain briefly how property owners should use the guidance.  To take, for example, the owner of a semi-detached property, the Revenue guidance may show the average valuation band for this property type in the location is between &#8364;350,000 and &#8364;400,000. If an owner of a 2 bedroom semi-detached property knows that the majority of semi-detached houses in their area have 3 bedrooms then that owner can reasonably expect the Revenue guidance to reflect the value of a 3-bed. This could offer a basis to adjust the valuation of their property downwards from the guidance average. In another example, in the case that the Deputy noted where four houses sold on a road over the last year are valued on the property price register between &#8364;100,000 and &#8364;200,000.  If all the houses are similar, then a property owner will likely select the most recent sale as the best guide to the value of their property.  If the four properties are different, then the owner should select the one that most resembles their house. </p><p>  Again, it is important reiterate that the Revenue guidance does not claim to value every house. Using the guidance requires a property owner to make an assessment based on their knowledge of their house, the neighbourhood, the house types and any factors they feel are relevant, as well as combining the Revenue guidance with property price register and any other appropriate sources of information available to them.</p><p>  The Deputy also makes a reference in her statement to the Revenue Estimate.  There has been much commentary about this figure, some of which has not been particularly helpful for property owners who are trying to meet their obligations.  As I have stated in the House previously, the Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner&#8217;s individual property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that they should pay.  This is the amount of LPT that will be pursued by Revenue, if the liable person fails to complete and submit their LPT Return.  It can be simply displaced by the property owner submitting their own valuation of their residential property and indicating their payment preference.</p><p>  I am also advised that underlying their simple valuation guidance system, a detailed economic model has been developed by Revenue. The model used is a hedonic econometric regression model. This approach disaggregates the value of a property into constituent parts to assess the contribution of different characteristics and provides a weighting for each. </p><p>  Information on property characteristics is taken from a range of sources:</p><p>  Geo-Directory: a list of all properties in Ireland, their type and location; </p><p>  Spatially derived data that indicate relative distances of all residential properties from a series of key amenities and services;</p><p>  Geographically linked data from sources, such as the Central Statistics Office 2011 Census results at small area level and the HP Pobal Deprivation Index. </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&#8217;s question on crime statistics, it should be noted that none of the information sources used by Revenue include data on criminal activity. </p><p>  Regarding property types, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Geo-Directory includes detached, semi-detached, bungalow and terraced properties. Revenue has used information on postal delivery points (also contained in Geo-Directory) to extrapolate where above property types are subdivided into flats or apartments. Geo-Directory does not distinguish corner or end terrace properties, Revenue has focused on data available for all properties in the State. As no nationwide database exists with information on corner or end terrace properties, these are not included in Revenue guidance.</p><p>  Details on the development of the economic model used by Revenue are included in a paper published by Revenue on their website in early March, which you reference in one of your questions. This paper includes all the standard outcome measures used when reporting on regression models of property values. The regression coefficients estimated for each property characteristic (the weightings) are not included. There are hundreds of estimated coefficients and their related statistical attributes across the various regression models produced. The weightings as estimated are dependent on the sample of valuations used in the model.  Because of a number of technical issues in the construction of the economic valuation model, it is not feasible to present the individual weightings in a meaningful way.</p><p>  Regarding the specific case raised by the Deputy, I am advised that Revenue is not providing guidance at the level of small area.  Instead Revenue&#8217;s guidance uses electoral districts. These are the smallest legally defined administrative areas in the State. The CSO has developed more granular areas, known as small areas.  Revenue used some CSO small area data from Census 2011 in estimating our valuation guidance and therefore the guidance takes into account small area variation to a degree. However, Revenue has not provided average valuation bands by small area. The main reason for this relates to data availability. Moving down to small area level in some cases would reduce the number of sales, which is used to generate the average valuation guidance, per small area to very low numbers. It is possible that some small areas would have no sales. From a statistical perspective, the use of limited numbers of valuations to generate averages would risk producing results that are not sufficiently robust or reliable.  For the Deputy&#8217;s information, the specific property in question is located in small area id number 268060012 according to Geo-Directory records.  I am informed that Geo-Directory and Central Statistics Office (CSO) classifications do not provide any additional identification description for small areas beyond the small area id number.</p><p>  The Revenue guidance follows methods similar to those used by tax administrations in other countries and meets internationally accepted standards for this type of work. In addition, it compares favourably to research in Ireland, including work by researchers in the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). Other valuation guidance and models in Ireland, for example those produced by some property or real estate listings websites, also use similar methods to providing average valuations.</p><p>  I am advised that the online guidance is being used extensively by the public.  Up to 11 April 2013, in excess of 847,000 &#8220;hits&#8221; were recorded on the site and over 181,000 users either opened the hard copy of the valuation guidance from the Revenue website or saved it to their own computer.  I would also like to point out, regarding guidance for those who do not use the internet, that the Revenue Commissioners have prepared paper copies of the indicative valuation band for each property type in every electoral district in the country.  These are available from Revenue public offices, the major Citizens&#8217; Information Centre offices and were made available to members of the House at briefing sessions organised for them a few weeks ago.</p><p>  In the context of a self assessed tax, I am completely satisfied that Revenue&#8217;s online valuation guidance is fit for purpose and performs at least equally well, if not better, than other sources of valuation guidance that are available. I am confident that the valuation guidance will be useful for the majority of property owners in assisting them to value their homes. </p><p>  I am also satisfied that Revenue&#8217;s general guidance on the various sources available to assist in property valuation enables property owners to make an honest and reasonable assessment of the appropriate valuation band for their residential property.  The level of public debate on property valuation suggests that most people are engaging with the Local Property Tax, have a good general sense of the value of their property, are carrying out research to enable them to do their self-assessed return, and I welcome that.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.644.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRM00400"><p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 sets out how the tax is to be administered and how a residential property is to be valued for Local Property Tax (LPT) purposes.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  For the purposes of LPT, property values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  As property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property, it is unlikely that any owner would find themselves in the position where they overpay their LPT.  </p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it is made in good faith, will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period.  This will ensure a measure of certainty for all property owners.  Accordingly, where an owner assesses that the value of a residential property on 1 May 2013 places it in a particular valuation band but, due to a general decrease in property prices after that date the reduction in the value of the property would place it in a lower valuation band, the owner will not be entitled to a refund of tax.  By the same token, if the property increases in value in that period, no additional charges will apply.  The owner will, however, have the opportunity to re-assess the value of the property on the next valuation date which is 1 November 2016.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am advised by the Commissioners that section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides for the possibility of a refund where an overpayment of LPT was made due to an error or mistake on a Return or a statement made by the liable person, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.  This might arise, for example, where a liable person had paid their LPT charge but they subsequently discovered that their property was exempt from the charge.  Generally speaking, a liable person seeking a refund because they over-valued their property would not come within the scope of this provision, so it is imperative that the liable person takes due care and attention is self-assessing the valuation band for the residential property.</p><p>  In the context of section 26 where an error or mistake is proven, I am advised that once a true and complete Return has been prepared and delivered to the Revenue Commissioners and all the information required by the Commissioners to make a determination on the case has been provided, a refund may issue where a claim for repayment is submitted to Revenue within the normal four year time limit.</p><p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the legislation also allows a liable person to appeal against a decision of the Revenue Commissioners not to allow a repayment.</p></reply>

Debt collection services apply across a significantly wider range of activities than the recovery of money by financial institutions, for example for the non payment of utilities, rents, hospital charges, college fees, other consumer debts and also debts between businesses.</p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible for legislation - the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 - which applies to all debt collectors that operate across any or all sectors of the economy, including private individuals and debt collecting firms.</p><p>  Under section 11 of this Act, it is an offence to demand payment of a debt in a way that is designed to cause alarm, distress or humiliation.  A person found guilty of offences under this Act is subject to large fines and up to 14 years imprisonment.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that there is no Consumer Protection Code applying specifically to debt collection firms.  However, the Deputy might wish to note that, in the case of financial institutions which use debt collection firms, the Central Bank has imposed requirements that offer protection to consumers under the revised Consumer Protection Code.  The Code obliges the regulated financial institutions that it covers to ensure that any outsources activity, such as debt collection, complies with the requirements of the Code.  This means that outsourced activity should uphold principles in the Code such as the requirement for financial institutions: -</p><p>- Not to exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer,</p><p>- To act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of customers and to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers and</p><p>- To prohibit personal visits or oral communications except in specified circumstances.</p><p>  The Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders also contains some requirements in this regard.  Where a moneylender engages the services of a third party to collect debts on its behalf, the moneylender must have in place a written contractual arrangement which seeks to ensure that consumers are treated in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the relevant provisions of the Act.  A moneylender must inform an affected consumer that his/her moneylending agreement has been assigned to a third party as soon as practicable after assigning the moneylending agreement.  This requirement does not apply where the moneylender, by agreement with the third party, continues to service the moneylending agreement vis-a-vis the consumer.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to know that the Consumer Protection Code 2012 is issued pursuant to powers under the following legislation:-</p><p>Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989</p><p>Section 23 and section 37 of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995</p><p>Section 8H of the Consumer Act 1995 and</p><p>Section 61 of the Insurance Act 1989</p><p>  The Central Bank has power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this Code, under Part 111C of the Central Bank Act 1942.</p></reply>

The charge referred to in the question is a charge made by AIB to the CBI in relation to its obligations due to participation in Target 2.  Target 2 is a real time gross settlement system for the Euro, used for the settlement of central bank operations, large-value interbank transfers as well as other Euro payments.  It allows for payments to be processed continuously rather than in time delayed batches.</p><p>  As the participation of banks in the system generates risk to the operator of the system i.e. the Euro system of Central Banks including the Central Bank of Ireland, a requirement of the Target 2 system is a floating charge over the Bank's eligible securities.  In accordance with the terms of Target 2, and as referred to in the deed of charge, the Bank specifies to the CBI which of its holdings of eligible securities provide the security from time to time.  The specified or &quot;segregated&quot; securities must be of an amount which covers the bank's obligations to the system. </p><p>  The charge is structured as a floating charge in recognition of the standard operations of banks whereby they change their available eligible securities on an on-going basis.  Within the detail of the charge there is then a mechanism to allow the floating charge to cover a specific subset of the banks' securities from time to time as designated by the bank. </p><p>  The deed of charge specifies the meaning of segregated to be those eligible securities which have been identified by AIB to the CBI and also specifies that where the value of the eligible securities which have been identified exceed the value of the payments being settled by AIB, then AIB can resubmit a schedule of segregated securities reducing them to meet the required value.</p></reply>

Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance is to undertake a range of targeted interventions that are the most appropriate to the specific risks presented in individual cases.  In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, yielding more than &euro;492 million.  Revenue will continue to develop innovative ways to identify non-compliance and to bring to account those who fail to comply with their tax obligations.  They will be assisted in this work by robust legislation to support compliance activities, including for example, the obligation that has been placed on merchant acquirers and other payment settlement entities to make returns of transactions to Revenue.  Their work is also supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) risk identification system, capture of information from multiple sources, and integrated systems that facilitate case selection.</p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in acting against the use of offshore accounts for the purposes of evading tax.  Revenue set up a dedicated unit, tasked with identifying and investigating Irish residents engaged in this form of tax evasion in 2001.  Further investigations targeting the settlement of funds and assets on trusts and similar offshore structures by Irish residents, was initiated in 2009.  Schemes of voluntary disclosure and investigations undertaken have, to date, resulted in the collection of &euro;1.1 billion in tax liabilities, statutory interest payments and penalties.  This work is ongoing.</p><p>  The Irish authorities would wish to avail of any additional information that might be of assistance in facilitating the continuing process of identifying persons evading tax through holding funds offshore.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, however, that they understand that neither the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists nor individual journalists involved in the investigation of offshore funds have, to date, made underlying data from their investigation available to tax authorities.  Ireland will be liaising and cooperating with the authorities in other countries and with the OECD to consider how matters arising from the recent reports can be progressed.</p><p>  Overall I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme that is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms and that their compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focused on the areas of greatest risk.</p><p>  I would also advise the Deputy that Ireland has signed 68 bilateral Double Taxation Agreements and 21 Tax Information Exchange Agreements, which ensures a system of full exchange of tax information.  Additionally, in December 2012, Ireland became one of the first countries in the world to sign an Agreement with the United States to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act).  In a public letter to the EU Commission on April 9th, five EU Member States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, have hailed FATCA-type Agreements as representing a &lsquo;step change in transparency&rsquo; and being the new &lsquo;international standard&rsquo; for automatic exchange of tax information.</p><p>  Combatting tax fraud and evasion has been a priority during our Presidency of the EU.  The issue was an important agenda item at the Informal EcoFin Council meeting that I chaired last weekend. During our Presidency we have taken forward the work in a range of key areas:</p><p>- Seeking agreement on Draft Council Conclusions on the EU Commission Action Plan on fraud and tax evasion;</p><p>- Pursuing a VAT anti-fraud package;</p><p>- Chairing work at the Code of Conduct Sub-Group on a proposal to combat double non-taxation and other tax evasion.</p><p>  Indeed, on foot of recent developments and progress made at the Informal EcoFin, further discussions will be held during May at senior official level on practical measures to combat tax fraud and evasion, in particular through potential progress on the Savings Directive.  It is intended to return again to the issue of tax fraud and evasion at EcoFin before the conclusion of our Presidency.</p></reply>

This is because the system used by the Revenue Commissioners to record appeals does so by reference to unsettled assessments.  Thus, a single issue can give rise to a number of appeals in relation to the same taxpayer.  Furthermore, in a number of instances appeals remain open because the matter in dispute is the subject of a test case involving a different taxpayer.  The Revenue Commissioners are analysing their records and will provide an update to the Deputy by the end of the month.</p></reply>

The underpayment for 2011 arose because the Department of Social Protection pension figure included in the Tax Credit Certificate for that year was understated.  A P21 balancing statement for 2011 issued to the person in question on 27th April 2012 and advised that the underpayment would be collected by reducing the tax credits in 2013.  The collection of the underpayment in 2013 means a reduction of &euro;11.16 per week in the net pension.  If this is causing difficulty, the person can contact the Wexford Tax District and if he wishes the underpayment can be spread over two or three years i.e. 2013 / 2014 or 2013 / 2014 / 2015.

I do not believe that such an intervention would be either effective or sustainable.  As regards the practices of UK distributors, this is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, but I note that the Competition Authority conducted a study on the retail-related import and distribution sector in 2009 and concluded that a number of factors plays a part in the explanation of exchange rate pass-through and that these are dependent on the peculiarities of different sectors and products.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a publication notification <i>PN 1882 - Ordering Goods for Personal Use over the Internet or from Mail Order Catalogues</i> that is available on their website is informative in this regard.  It points out that internet shoppers need to be aware of the potential full price of the goods involved since some websites do not make allowance for charges such as Customs Duty, Excise Duty or VAT.  In addition, a carrier handling charge, that is distinct from a Customs charge, is generally applied by the carrier delivering the goods.  This means that it is difficult to make direct price comparisons between domestic and other-EU internet sales companies.</p><p>  European VAT legislation and Irish VAT legislation contain the concept of distance selling.  Distance selling means a supplier established in one Member State sells goods to customers who are not registered for VAT in another Member State.  Where a company established in one Member State makes distance sales to customers in another Member State the company must register and account for VAT on those sales where the value of the sales exceeds distance sales threshold, currently &#8364;35,000 in Ireland.  For example, a UK established company that makes distance sales in excess of &#8364;35,000 to customers in Ireland who are not registered for VAT must register for VAT in Ireland and charge Irish VAT.  The VAT distance sales rules significantly reduce the VAT advantages of internet sales companies establishing in EU countries with VAT rates that are lower than Ireland&#8217;s for the purpose of making supplies to Irish customers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.681.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRM03000"><p>Finance Act 2013 includes a section on the Living City Initiative which introduces a scheme of tax incentives focusing on the regeneration of the historic centres of some of our main cities.  The scheme which will be introduced by Ministerial order, will apply in the first instance on a pilot basis only to specified regeneration areas in Waterford and Limerick.  My Department has prepared an information note on this incentive which was published on the Department's website on 13 February last.  The historic centres of some of our cities have suffered for a long time from gradual depopulation and the relocation of family homes and businesses to the suburbs, particularly during the period of the Celtic Tiger.  These centres have also suffered greatly from the general economic downturn of the past few years.  While I am not suggesting that this scheme is capable on its own of reversing that trend, I am convinced that it has a part to play. </p><p>  The particular focus of the scheme is as follows: to encourage people back to the centres of Irish cities to live in historical buildings, in particular Georgian houses; and to encourage the regeneration of the retail heartland of central city business districts.</p><p>  I indicated in my budget speech in December last year that I would examine proposals for a targeted incentive for already identified regeneration areas.  The tax relief that will apply under this scheme will operate for five years from the date of commencement.  However, it is my intention that before it begins, the scheme will be subject to an <i>ex ante </i>cost benefit analysis and, subject to a positive outcome from the analysis, I will seek EU approval under State Aid rules for this initiative to be commenced for Limerick and Waterford cities. </p><p>  There are two strands to the scheme.  The first involves a tax relief for the refurbishment or conversion of Georgian houses for residential purposes.  The relief will only apply to owner occupiers and not for rented residential accommodation.  It is not a section 23 provision, which was relief for investors. </p><p>  The second strand is a scheme of accelerated industrial buildings allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of retail premises although other business services will also be allowed where the premises is a Georgian building.  In such cases the commercial element will be confined to the ground floor or basement with a residential element upstairs.  The allowance is at a rate of 15% per annum for six years and 10% in year seven and is subject to the normal balancing charges of allowances if disposed of within that time period.  I have not yet decided on the exact boundaries of the regeneration areas in these cities but I will be consulting with my Government colleagues and the relevant local authorities beforehand before I make any final decision.</p><p>  I hope these reliefs will help to restore some of these inner city areas to their former glory.  The prevalence of Georgian houses is a particular characteristic of the built environment of many Irish cities.  While some of these Georgian buildings have fallen into a state of disrepair and dereliction, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and I have been exploring ways in which to promote and support the regeneration of these city centres.  This pilot scheme is a targeted initiative which is aimed specifically at Georgian areas and I do not intend to go beyond this at this stage. </p><p>  The reliefs I am introducing are an attempt to encourage people back into the cities to raise their families and if possible to operate their businesses from there.  It will not be possible to revitalise these inner city areas without this happening. Pobal, the State agency that supports local communities, has developed a sophisticated index which measures deprivation in different local areas across Ireland.  Taking into account the deprivation statistics from the 2011 census, both Limerick and Waterford scored as the most disadvantaged of our major cities.  Furthermore unemployment rates in these cities are also the highest, significantly worse than the national average.  Both have their own unique problems regarding unemployment and social problems and for these reasons I have selected them alone for the pilot phase of this initiative.</p></reply>

Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability.

The original closing date for receipt of applications was 15th December 2005, however section 8 of the 2002 Act allowed the Board to extend the period for receipt of an application in exceptional circumstances.  The Residential Institutions Redress Amendment Act, 2011 removed the Board's power to accept late applications received on or after the 17th September, 2011.  The Board is continuing to process its remaining applications and late submissions.  Accordingly I have no proposals to amend the 2002 Act.</p><p>  I have recently established the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund (RISF) Board pursuant to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act, 2012.  The Board will oversee the use of the cash contributions of up to &euro;110 million pledged by the religious congregations to support the needs of some 15,000 survivors of residential institutional child abuse, who have received awards from the Redress Board mentioned earlier or equivalent Court awards.  It is now a matter for the RISF Board to determine the range of approved services with the four classes of service stipulated in the Act, i.e. mental health services (including counselling and psychological support) health and personal social services, education services and housing services.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.  The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website.  The staffing arrangements for the 2013/14 school year (Circular 0013/2013) were published in February and are available on the website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.</p><p>  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0013/2013.</p><p>  The allocation process at individual school level is currently underway.  The Staffing Appeals Board held its first meeting in late March and schools have been notified of the outcome of their appeals.</p><p>  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.

Springboard 2011 provided part-time higher education places for 4,956 unemployed people on 204 courses at certificate, degree and post graduate level.  To date 2,460 participants have graduated from Springboard 2011 courses and 649 are continuing to a further year of study.  5,335 unemployed people have enrolled on 211 different higher education courses under the second phase of Springboard in 2012.  Graduation data from Springboard 2012 will be available in the summer.</p><p>  The evaluation framework for Springboard provides for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of outputs.  A first stage evaluation report, which was published by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in February 2012 and is available at www.hea.ie/en/node/1463, showed that Springboard has been very successful in reaching its target cohorts: 77% of participants were aged between 25 and 49, 60% had been out of work for more than 1 year and 20% had previously been employed in construction.</p><p>  A second stage evaluation report was published in February 2013 and is available at www.hea.ie/en/node/1514.  It shows that 30% of Springboard participants were back in work within 6 weeks of completing a Springboard course and that 40% were back in work within 6 months of completion.  Outcomes varied across programme areas and levels and by age and duration unemployed.</p></reply>

I would remind the deputy that curricular change was considered imperative in view of the concerns about rote learning, student uptake at Higher Level and student achievement levels in mathematics.  The new syllabus is designed to transform teaching and learning of Mathematics at second level, so that students will develop instrumental understanding (knowing how), relational understanding (knowing why), the ability to apply their knowledge and skills in familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and analytical and creative powers in mathematics.  The comprehensive programme of professional development available to all teachers of mathematics focuses primarily on the teaching approaches required to achieve these goals.  Such a fundamental reform requires attitudinal change which will only come in time as the new syllabus embeds in schools.  Project Maths was implemented on a phased basis and all five strands of Project Maths were rolled out to mainstream schools in September 2012.</p><p>  In relation to review, following a tendering process the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) was awarded a contract to conduct research into the impact of Project Maths on student motivation, learning and achievement in:-</p><p>- the initial 24 schools who were engaged in the project since September 2008 and</p><p>- all the other post-primary schools where syllabus change commenced in September 2010.</p><p>  The student-focussed research design has two components:Part One focuses on testing students' mathematical performance in areas significant to Project Maths, and on exploring their attitudes towards mathematics.  Part Two uses analysis of students' work and detailed case studies to develop a data-rich picture of mathematics teaching and learning.  The first interim report, published in November 2012, found that students appear to be performing well in many aspects of the revised syllabus.  The report is available online at www.ncca.ie.</p><p>  I recently received a report from the Irish Maths Teachers Association.  It summarised the findings of a consultation which was carried out with their members. Senior officials from my Department have met with officials from the IMTA to discuss the implications of the findings.</p></reply>

Construction commenced on that project in May 2012.  The contractor is Ganson Building and Civil Engineering Contractors.  In common with the rest of the Public Sector, capital works projects in schools are tendered under the standard Public Works Contracts as required by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC).  The Guidelines require a competitive process carried out in an open, objective and transparent manner to achieve best value for money in public procurement.</p><p>  Essential principles to be observed in conducting all procurement functions include non&ndash;discrimination, equal treatment, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, freedom to provide service and freedom of establishment.  School Building Projects, including Scoil Mhuire, Woodview, are tendered in compliance with the above guidelines and requirements.  While the current public works contract for the above building project does not require contractors to use local labour or materials, it is the case that building projects by their nature generally contribute to economic activity in the locality in which they are carried out.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Government Construction Contracts Committee are currently considering the possibility of inclusion of social clauses in future public works contracts.  My Department will implement any future changes to public works contracts in accordance with the guidelines given.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  The provisions which are made by my Department to ensure that as many children with special educational needs as possible can complete Post Primary school education, include the provision of additional resource/learning support in post primary schools, the provision of special classes in mainstream schools, Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for children who have care needs, and the provision of assistive technology supports where required.  </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs.  The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan.  It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.</p><p>  Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils with special needs.  Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have also been designed in such a way to enable teachers to cater for the wide range of pupil ability.</p><p>  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) is a service under the management of my Department which also supports schools and provides additional training for them in supporting students with special educational needs.  I also wish to advise the Deputy that a variety of options are in place for young persons, including those with special education needs, to continue with educational provision after the age of 18.</p><p>  My Department provides funding to Vocational Education Committees (VECs) nationwide for a range of part-time and full-time accredited and non-accredited further and adult education programmes which are open to all learners, including those with special educational needs.  </p><p>  The Adult Literacy Programme provides basic education including reading, writing and numeracy skills, and ICT for adults who wish to improve their literacy and numeracy competencies to enhance their functional participation in personal, social and economic life.  The Community Education programme provides education and learning, generally outside the formal education sector, with the aims of enhancing learning, empowerment and contributing to civic society.</p><p>  Funding is also provided to VECs to support local community-based education groups outside the formal education sector and is usually allocated through the provision of teaching hours, or small grants, to a range of community and voluntary groups for educational activities.</p><p>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme also provides a third level admissions scheme for school leavers who have a disability or specific learning difficulty.  Students who are considered to be DARE eligible may secure a college place on a reduced points basis. Details of the DARE scheme are available at www.<i> accesscollege.ie</i>.  Additional supports for young adults with special educational needs are also provided by Disability Officers in third level colleges.</p></reply>

The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with forty research projects at various stages including its energy website at www.energyineducation.ie.</p><p>  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Departments Schools technical guidance documents must achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating.  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements.  Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p><p>  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs and not just applied for the sake of having a renewable tag on a school.  It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications.  This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p><p>  The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools for the past seven years.  Over 40% of the research programme features renewable aspects.  Results from these projects indicate that the application of renewables do not present a viable solution in existing schools due to a number of variables such as energy and water usage profiles etc.  A summary of these findings are publicly available on the schools energy website at www.energyineducation.ie.</p><p>  For the Deputy's information, the results of the application of wind energy schemes in schools indicate that given the scale of application to match demand and capacity in a meaningful way, that schools rather than be provided with funding individually should instead be encouraged to consider the use of wind generated electricity which is available nationally through the National Grid.  This in effect allows the school to benefit from the environmental and lower cost benefits of wind generated electricity without being exposed to operating and maintenance issues and reliability of supply.</p><p>  The potential for renewables in schools is under continued review by my Departments Energy Research Programme with continued research and by monitoring improvements in technology and the market place.</p></reply>

The current status of all schools on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie. </p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Five Year Construction Plan, that I announced on 9 March 2012, outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Plan.  The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.  Given the need to meet demographic growth, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.  In this context, it is not possible to indicate at this point when a building project for the school in question will be progressed. </p><p>  In the meantime, a technical visit was very recently carried out by my Department to examine the schools current accomodation issues.

There is a second stage tendering process which involves the assessment of actual tenders against a pre-determined marking system.</p><p>  In order to win contracts the fees element of the tendering process must be competitive for all providers (Public, Private and Not for Profit).  Private providers have to include in their tender their business and investment costs, staff, overheads, developing their staff, development of curriculum and delivery material, facilities, transport, tutor expenses (T&amp;S).  The F&Aacute;S Contracted Training Tender List has providers from all 3 types, (Public, Private and Not for Profit) and all 3 types of providers succeed in winning tenders.</p><p>  I am not aware of any evidence that contracted trainers are making huge profits, because the market is regulating the value of the contracts in question.

It would not always follow that a post-primary school with a number of DEIS schools among its cohort of feeder schools would automatically qualify for DEIS because the relative level of disadvantage in the school was based on a number of key identifiers and selected by reference to centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases which included:</p><p>- Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate - School Programme candidates);</p><p>- Junior Certificate retention rates by school;</p><p>- Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS - &quot;Overall Performance Scale&quot; - score). This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best aggregated to school level;</p><p>- Leaving Certificate retention rates by schoolThe process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.  The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available.</p><p>  Prioritising and maintaining resources for children at risk of educational disadvantage is a significant challenge given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure. This limits capacity for any additionality, or inclusion of further schools, in the DEIS programme.</p></reply>

The Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011, provides for the development of a new policy framework for procurement. This work is now being led by the newly appointed Chief Procurement Officer, Paul Quinn. Under his leadership a new national procurement office for the public sector is being established. Paul is currently working with officials across the public sector to put in place new sectoral and centralised procurement arrangements.</p><p>  My colleague Minister Howlin has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public sector is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. Centralising the procurement of commonly used goods and services can deliver significant benefits which include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and enhanced service levels.</p><p>  In addition, given the financial constraints within which we must all now work, cost reductions and savings can go some way to helping Exchequer funded bodies, such as schools, manage within reducing financial budgets.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the National Procurement Service (NPS) is supporting Small and Medium Business Enterprises (SMEs) to participate in public sector procurement competitions through its education and guidance strategies.  All of the NPS tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs in competitions, by encouraging them to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.</p><p>  I understand that that Irish SMEs have been successful in winning NPS frameworks and about three quarters of existing NPS contracts/frameworks are held by SMEs.  These SMEs may, in turn, source many of their services and products from local manufacturers and agents.</p><p>  However, I do appreciate the concerns being raised by small school supply companies and I have asked relevant officials here in the Department, who are coordinating procurement reform in the Education and Training sector, to take these concerns into consideration in the context of the work being undertaken on procurement reform.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of supports to schools and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The NCSE also provides support and advice to parents of children with special educational needs who are seeking educational placements for their children and clarifies availability of school placements for the purpose of home tuition applications.</p><p>  The NCSE identified placements for the children referred to by the Deputy in June 2011.  Home tuition was approved for the children for a 4 week  period  from the start of the 2011/2012 school year as  the  placements  previously identified by NCSE had been taken by other children and were no longer available.  One of the special classes for autism approved by NCSE at this time did not open until December 2011 as the school needed additioal time to recruit the additional teaching and SNA staff required.  Home Tuition was further approved for the child to which the Deputy has referred until the date that the new class physically opened on the basis that he was unable to access placement during this period. This approval was provided notwithstanding that the child had not been enrolled by then and remains not enrolled in the school despite the identification of the placement.  The NCSE and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) remain available to assist the parents of the child in question with school placement options in recognised schools should the parents choose to avail of this assistance.</p></reply>

The circular states that the period of service reckonable for redundancy payment purposes will only consist of the period of the Special Needs Assistant's continuous service in the school in which he/she was last employed.  The schools referenced by the Deputy are separate schools with separate roll numbers and are therefore separate employers.

However the purpose of the Fund is, as advocated in the original motion passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, intended for the support of victims.  In this regard, eligible former residents will have a range of needs, with some likely to require more significant interventions than others.</p><p>  I have recently established the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund (RISF) Board pursuant to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act, 2012.  The Board will oversee the use of the cash contributions of up to &euro;110 million pledged by the religious congregations to support the needs of some 15,000 survivors of residential institutional child abuse, who have received awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or equivalent Court awards.  Supports across a range of services, including mental health services, health and personal social services and housing services, as well as education services will be available.</p><p>  The Board held its inaugural meeting on 27th March and has commenced work on the arrangements to be put in place for the operation of the Fund.  Further publicity will be undertaken as the work of the Board progresses and a website with detailed information on the Fund's services will be developed.</p></reply>

The provision for the 2012/13 school year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, the overall level of funding for special education has been retained.</p><p>  In line with this Government's commitment to protect frontline services for pupils with special educational needs:</p><p>- 10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the current school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities.</p><p>- Approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation Model, are also being provided in primary &amp; post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>- Over 1,100 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios, for example the autism PTR is 6:1 and the moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.</p><p>- Enhanced levels of school capitation are payable to most special schools and special classes and special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities are provided at a cost of over &euro;60m per year.</p><p>- Approximately &euro;1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support.</p><p>- Early educational intervention is provided for children with autism from 2&frac12; years of age. There are now 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department.  Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism who are unable to access placement in an early intervention class.</p><p>- An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism.</p><p>  The level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post primary schools and special schools this year, including such schools in Co. Kerry.</p><p>  My Department has also requested the National Council for Special Education to provide policy advice to the Department, in accordance with its role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, on the appropriate nature and configuration of educational supports which should be provided to schools to support children with special educational needs.</p><p>  In preparing its advice the NCSE has consulted widely with representative bodies and education partners. The advice from the NCSE is expected in the coming months.</p><p>  It is intended that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students. The advice will be a key input into achieving this goal.</p></reply>

These will be issued to all schools at the beginning of the next school year.</p><p>  Since the Action Plan was launched, the Department of Education and Skills has also supported an awareness raising initiative specifically targeted at young people on the topic of cyber bullying.  This campaign was launched as part of Safer Internet Day in February.</p><p>  Central to promoting safer use of the Internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyber bullying incidents. Implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas and build on my Department's current strategy to ensure that internet safety is mainstreamed throughout the school's teaching, learning and other practices.

As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  With regard to Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) the position is that there is no definitive or universally accepted research which supports the use of one intervention exclusively for all children with autism. However, research does support the use of any of a range of autism-specific interventions depending on the individual needs of the child. </p><p>  My Department's policy is based on the advice of international experts on autism; NEPS; the Inspectorate; an analysis of research, including the study referred to by the Deputy and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. The preferred approach ensures that each child can draw from a number of different approaches to ensure the optimum individualised educational programme for him/her. </p><p>  The use of behavioural interventions, including ABA, is supported by my Department by providing training for teachers in their use. However, it is not accepted that ABA should be the only intervention used.</p></reply>

Specifically, the following sections have been commenced - 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53. The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced. </p><p>  In light of the very difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) had suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. My Department's view is that the level of investment required would now be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. </p><p>  Given the costs involved and current fiscal constraints, addressing this issue will be very challenging. I will be considering how we can develop a plan to implement the objectives of the EPSEN Act so as to deliver improved educational outcomes for students with special needs. </p><p>  The NCSE has been asked to provide comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs. This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan. </p></reply>

The advice from the NCSE is expected in the coming weeks.  It is my intention that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students.

During 2010 and 2011, the Department had been examining the question of increasing the number of primary school places in the area to cater for the expected increase in enrolments. The patron indicated that, following local consultation in the area, the consensus was that the parish should not be involved in further primary school provision in the area.</p><p>  My Department subsequently put in place an application and patron selection process for the establishment of new schools to cater for increasing demographics in Ashbourne.  Applications for patronage of proposed new schools were received from An Foras Patr&uacute;nachta and from Educate Together, both of whom are well established national patron bodies. Both patron bodies proposed to establish multi-denominational schools. Given that all existing schools in Ashbourne were Catholic in ethos, the provision of multi-denominational schools would increase diversity and parental choice in the area. Following consideration of these applications, approval was given for the commencement of a new Gaelscoil, which opened in September 2011, and a new Educate Together School, which opened in September 2012.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this and following recent engagement between my Department and the local primary schools, my Department has approved the expansion of St. Declan's National School to a fully vertical 3-stream school from September 2013. In addition, approval has been conveyed to Gaelscoil na M&iacute; and Ashbourne Educate Together National School to accept an intake of two Junior Infant Classes each from September next.</p><p>  With the commencement of the two new primary schools in the area, together with the proposed school expansions from September 2013, there will be capacity for up to ten junior infant classes across the five schools from September 2013.  Six of these junior infant classes will be provided in schools with a Catholic ethos and four will be provided in schools with a multi-denominational ethos. This additional capacity at junior infant level should be more than sufficient to meet the projected demand for school places in the area.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p></reply>

Supports across a range of services, including mental health services, health and personal social services, education services and housing services will be available.  </p><p>  The legislation followed a comprehensive consultation process and I am aware that there are divergent views among survivors of abuse on the Fund, with some advocating a simple distribution of the available money.

This work is now being led by the newly appointed Chief Procurement Officer, Paul Quinn.  Under his leadership, a new national procurement office for the public sector is being established.  Paul Quinn is currently working with officials across the public sector, including those in my Department, to put in place new sectoral and centralised procurement arrangements.  </p><p>  My colleague Minister Howlin has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public sector is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.  It has been estimated that &euro;9 billion is spent by public bodies annually on the procurement of supplies and services. Centralising the procurement of commonly used goods and services can deliver significant benefits which include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and enhanced service levels. </p><p>  The National Procurement Office (NPS) is already supporting Small and Medium Business Enterprises (SMEs) to participate in public sector procurement competitions through its education and guidance strategies.  All of the NPS tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs in competitions, by encouraging them to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.</p><p>  I understand that Irish SMEs have been successful in winning NPS frameworks and about three quarters of existing NPS contracts/frameworks are held by SMEs.  These SMEs may, in turn, source many of their services and products from local manufacturers and agents.  However, I do appreciate the concerns being raised by local school supply companies and I have asked relevant officials here in the Department, who are coordinating procurement reform in the Education and Training sector, to take these concerns into consideration in the context of the work being undertaken on procurement reform.</p></reply>

The purpose of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  The safety of schoolchildren carried on services provided under the School Transport Scheme is of paramount importance to both my Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann. In circumstances where the behaviour of a child on board a school transport service has the potential to undermine the safety of the child themselves and/or the safety of other children being carried, the safe operation of the service itself, or the safety of other road users, Bus &Eacute;ireann has a responsibility to take immediate steps to restore a safe environment on board that service.</p><p>  The withdrawal of school transport facilities is a reluctantly taken final option exercised when all other options have been tried without success.  In this particular case Bus &Eacute;ireann tried a number of different methods to provide suitable transport for the pupil in question including the changing of vehicles, the provision of an exclusive service and the assistance of escorts. Regrettably these proved unsuccessful.  Where a service is withdrawn, a Special Transport Grant is offered to parents towards the cost of private transport arrangements. </p></reply>

For example, my Department subscribed in 1994 to the Salamanca Statement endorsing the principle of all children's fundamental right to education, acknowledging that education systems should be designed to accommodate each child's unique characteristics, interests, abilities and learning needs. These principles were further endorsed by the Council of Europe's Political Declaration in 2003 and its Action Plan in 2006, and more recently in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Ireland's participation in these organisations has contributed to the putting in place of structural and legislative frameworks to govern the provision of education for children with special educational needs, the development of an inclusive education system which is designed to meet their needs, and enhanced levels of provision for children with special educational needs at the various stages of the education system.</p><p>  Ireland continues to engage in dialogue with national governments through its involvement in international organisations such as the European Community and the United Nations. I can confirm that my Department will continue to take account of international developments in special education and to liaise with our partners in the EU in the development policy in respect of provision for pupils with special educational needs.</p></reply>

These arrangements include the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment.Under the terms of Circular 0013/2013, Section 3, where a school is expanding the number of intake classes which would generate a new stream of pupils, the school must have received prior approval for such expansion from both the school patron and from the Planning and Building Unit of my Department.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department carried out an analysis on the catchment area in which the school referred to by the Deputy is included and concluded that there are sufficient primary school places in the catchment area to meet demand.  As a result the school has been advised by the Planning and Building Unit that the staffing of the school should remain at Principal + 8 mainstream teachers and 2 special classes (ASD).  The application for a post on developing grounds was refused on this basis.</p></reply>

The Landscape document published in February 2012 lays out a clear four stage process and criteria for institutes of technology who wish to apply for designation as a technological university. The process for designation is designed to ensure educational quality, objectivity, international expertise, fairness and transparency. The process will consist of four stages overseen by HEA, with an independent international panel of experts to advise the Authority in the final stages.</p><p>  The first stage requires institutes of technology to submit a formal expression of interest in merging and seeking designation. I understand from HEA that three such expressions of interest have been received. One of these is a proposal that Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology to seek designation.</p><p>  Having regard to the process that has been put in place to assess proposals for designation as technological universities I do not propose to comment specifically on any potential applications for designation by any group of Institutes of Technology.</p></reply>

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2011/12 school year. The national average class size is 24.4 pupils. However, with over 20,600 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p></reply>

It requires that, in order to be eligible to receive the qualified rate of pay and allowances, a person on their first appointment to teaching must be registered with the Teaching Council and appropriately qualified for that position or sector.  This was introduced for the purpose of ensuring quality and promoting professional standards in teaching and this goal has been strongly supported by the teacher unions.</p><p>  The second measure was taken as part of Budget 2011. The last Government applied a reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service. In the case of new teachers, a reduction of 10% was applied to pay and certain allowances and all new teachers were required to start on the first point of the scale rather than the third point as had previously been the case for most teachers.  The new pay rates applied to all teachers who were new appointees appointed on or after 1 January 2011.  Where a person gave any service - qualified or unqualified - in an analogous teaching position before 1 January 2011, he or she was not regarded as a new appointee to teaching and so was not </p><p>  The third measure formed part of Budget 2012 and related to qualification allowances. The Government announced that additional qualification allowances would not be payable to existing teachers and new teachers would be paid qualification allowances up to a maximum of the allowance applicable to an honours primary degree level.</p><p>  Furthermore, in 2012 a public service-wide review of allowances was also carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, pending its outcome, the payment of qualification allowances was suspended with effect from 1 February 2012.  As a result of the review, the Government abolished qualification allowances with effect from that date and a new salary scale was created with a starting point equivalent to the fourth point of the previous scale.  This reduced the impact of the ending of the qualification allowances and ensured a broad consistency across the public service. Circular 8/2013 outlines the details of the review and the new arrangements that apply to teachers.</p><p>  If the Deputy has a specific query in relation to an individual teacher he should forward the detail to my Department.  The introduction of this new salary scale has been a complex task which has required a detailed implementation process.  My Department, in consultation with the unions, VECs, is working through the operational aspects of these changes as they affect existing teachers and their pay.</p></reply>

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or through a combination of these. Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.  However my Department is mindful that greater clarity would be useful for schools and parents and accordingly my Department is currently in the process of preparing a comprehensive statement of existing policy within the boundaries of one document. This process is ongoing.   The Department's policy on the education of children with Autism resides within the overall policies on the education of children with special educational needs. In the main these policies are non condition specific. In this context, the Autism policy, whether expressed in a multiple of documents or in a single document, should not be viewed as a separate 'stand alone' policy.  The new policy statement will not be exclusive. Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time. Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.  </p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.</p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.</p><p>  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate broadly within the policy parameters.</p><p>  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.</p><p>  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.</p></reply>

There was no interference to the Auk Stream adjacent to or within landowner's property.  I am advised that works were carried out along a short stretch of the Auk Stream West upstream of his lands.  These particular works do not cause increased frequency or depth of flooding to the landowner's property. However, it has already been acknowledged that the scheme works, as a whole, will increase the likely depth of flooding during less frequent flood events, and the property owner was advised of his entitlement to claim compensation in respect of such loss under the relevant legislative provisions.</p><p>  In relation to the demarcated flowpath, my officials advise that this is within the River Suir flood plain across which river waters flowed in the past and will flow during times of flood, and they are satisfied with the efficiency of the designed scheme.</p><p>  The Commissioners of Public Works considered all feasible options for a flood relief scheme for Clonmel Town and the scheme, as designed and constructed, combines a number of flood relief measures which represent the most economically beneficial and environmentally sustainable solution to the flooding problems in Clonmel.  I am advised that, while natural and historic conditions would be noted in the design of a flood relief scheme, the designers would deal with the existing topography of the area at the time of design.</p><p>  I understand that the most likely route for flood water will depend on the topography of the area in question and that flood water does not necessarily flow in a straight line but will flow along the path of least resistance under the influence of gravity.  I am advised that the embankments constructed at Green Lane and Greenane were constructed within the flood plain of the River Suir.  They were built to protect existing properties in Clonmel from flooding and are part of the integrated design of the flood relief scheme and, as stated above, my officials are fully satisfied with the scheme design.</p></reply>

Codes include the Code of Practice governing the External and Internal Appointments of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Irish Civil Service and Certain Public Bodies, available at www.cpsa.ie.</p><p>  Public service bodies are also subject to specific legal obligations in the Disability Act 2005.  For example, Part 5 of the Act sets out the the requirement of public service bodies:</p><p>  - to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities;</p><p>  - to comply with any statutory Code of Practice;</p><p>  - to meet a target of 3% of employees with disabilities;</p><p>  - to report every year on achievement of these obligations.</p><p>  The National Disability Authority (NDA) reports on compliance with this 3% target. In its latest published report in 2012, the NDA noted that in the civil service, the area of the public service for which I have direct responsibility, 4.2% of staff employed had disabilities. In relation to other areas of the public service, each Minister is responsible for compliance with and reporting on the target set in the Disability Act 2005 for the employment of persons with disabilities in public bodies under his or her aegis.</p><p>  The 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service remains in place, notwithstanding the recruitment and promotion moratorium announced on 27 March, 2009.</p><p>  You may also wish to note that a number of Departments and Offices in the civil service are participants in the Willing Able and Mentoring (WAM) Programme which is a paid mentored work placement programme aimed at graduates with disabilities.  This programme is not subject to the moratorium.</p><p>  The Disability Act defines &quot;disability&quot;, in relation to a person, as a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.</p></reply>

I would like to take this opportunity point out that the proposed reductions will apply only to pensions in excess of &euro;32,500; pensions below that level will not be affected.

The basis of rateable valuation for all commercial property, including retail units in suburban shopping centres, is net annual value and is set out in Part 11 of the Valuation Act, 2001. </p><p>  Net annual value is the rental for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes and charges (if any) payable by or under any enactment in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property. </p><p>  Various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV/rental value) of a building.

This is the method used to estimate the net annual value (NAV/rental value) of retail units in suburban shopping centres. </p><p>  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations, i.e. revision and revaluation.</p><p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain existing local authority valuations lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally. </p><p>   In a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  To-date, revaluations of the commercial list have been completed in South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire County Council areas and the revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013.</p><p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is responsible for the administration of the Valuation Act and is independent in the exercise of his duties under the act and I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p></reply>

It serves as a repository for notices above EU thresholds and which must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union. In accordance with policy guidelines from my Department contracting authorities are also obliged to publish all tender notices for goods and services with a value greater than &euro;25,000 on the eTender website. </p><p>  An upgrade to the site was launched on 12th November 2012. The new site, as well as publishing contract notices has a wide range of additional functionality that in effect will allow other aspects of the procurement process to be completed electronically, including assessment, awarding and contract management. This additional functionality is improving and generating efficiencies for both the public and private sectors. </p><p>  Prior to launching the new site, the supplier representative bodies including Chambers Ireland, IBEC, ISME and the Small Firms Association were briefed on the new system and electronic copies of Supplier User Manuals were supplied to them for distribution to their respective membership. The National Procurement Service meets these bodies on a regular basis.</p><p>  Also prior to the launch, registered Suppliers and Buyers on the system, in excess of 70,000 users, were informed about the proposed change of system and user manuals were sent to each of them electronically. Suppliers were also informed of the up-coming change of system at various Meet the Buyer events and other such seminars. </p><p>  Prior to and since the launch of the new site, the NPS has organised a number of demonstrations for Buyers on the new site with several thousand buyers attending. Since the system went live on 12th November demonstrations of the new system have been given to suppliers at Meet the Buyer events. The National Procurement Service has also agreed with the Construction Industry Federation to give a seminar on the new system to them on a date to be agreed by them.</p></reply>

As part of these consultations and in the context of the ongoing work under the Shannon CFRAM study being undertaken for OPW by Jacobs Engineering, it was agreed to explore the possibility of carrying out a water level monitoring exercise, involving controlled raising and lowering of weir boards at selected locations, subject to favourable hydrological conditions.  </p><p>  For the monitoring exercise to go ahead three criteria have to be satisfied.  The first is that the level downstream of Athlone must be sufficiently low not to cause flooding in the callows.  The second is that the level on Lough Ree is not below the recently agreed ESB lower target operating level in early summer and the third is that  a significant rainfall event is forecast. </p><p>  At the moment only the first of the above criteria is clearly satisfied.

For the past seven years, Government Departments and Offices in the Civil Service have been supportive of and participated in the WAM programme.  WAM is a paid mentored work placement programme which is organised by AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) and offers graduates with disabilities up to six months paid work. </p><p>  There was considerable interest in the Civil Service WAM positions advertised earlier this year. 65 applications were received for 21 positions. Due to the level of interest, a competitive process, including shortlisting of candidates, was required.  </p><p>  The shortlisting process, which was difficult due to the overall high calibre of the candidates, was carried out against two criteria.

Under PIPS the State offers to sell annuities on an Exchequer cost-neutral basis to certain defined benefit pension schemes where the scheme is winding-up in deficit and where the parent company is insolvent (the double insolvency condition).</p><p>Normally when a scheme winds up the trustees buy annuities in respect of current pensioners from an insurance company.  Under PIPS the trustees of a defined benefit scheme that satisfy the double insolvency condition are given the alternative of buying out the pensions with the Exchequer. The Exchequer should be able to provide pensions at a lower cost than an insurance company. The saving from this lower cost would then go to reducing the shortfall of those members who have yet to retire.</p><p>The technical calculations involved in PIPS are carried out by the National Treasury Management Agency so as to make PIPS cost neutral to the Exchequer. Once a pension scheme has applied, my Department requests the NTMA to quote a cost for providing annuities to existing pensioners. Under the SI governing PIPS the appropriate interest rate for this quote is set by the National Treasury Management Agency based on the long-term cost of borrowing to the State at the time.</p><p>To date seven pension schemes have applied to participate in PIPS. The NTMA have provided quotes for six schemes. Two schemes &ndash; the Waterford Crystal Staff and Waterford Crystal Factory Schemes - have paid the quoted price and have entered PIPS. The following sets out the dates of calculations and interest rates used for the two Waterford schemes:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Scheme</b><b></b><br /><b>Waterford Crystal Staff Scheme</b></th><th><b>Date of Calculation</b><br /><b>27/08/2012</b></th><th><b>Interest Rate for Quote</b><br /><b>5.849% </b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Waterford Crystal Factory Scheme</b></td><td><b>27/08/2012</b></td><td><b>5.849%</b></td></tr></table></p><p>The NTMA have provided quotes for a further four schemes. These quotes have been given to the trustees of the schemes in question and they are now under consideration by them.</p><p>The remaining scheme is in the process of finalising its application to PIPS. When this application is finalised the NTMA will be asked to provide a quote for this scheme.</p></reply>

The majority of the aggregated arrangements are not new and have been available to the public service for a number of years.  In utilising the national contracts, public bodies are able to take advantage of the NPS&rsquo;s buying power and as a result can purchase supplies at competitive prices.  This facilitates ongoing service delivery within tighter operating budgets.</p><p>  In relation to the potential impact of aggregated procurement arrangements, it is worth noting that such arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money and also facilitates SME access.  While certain categories of goods and services may be suited to single supplier arrangements (e.g. electricity and gas), it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm.  The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services - can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself.  In order to facilitate SMEs, the NPS has encouraged tenderers who did not have the capability in their own right of providing goods and services nationally to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.  Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  Attendees could avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  In Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p></reply>

The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs.  In this regard, my Department has issued public procurement guidelines (Circular 10/10) to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p><p>  The assessment of a tenderer&rsquo;s financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.  Therefore there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements must logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p><p>  I have arranged for my Department to remind public bodies about this aspect of the public procurement guidance and the importance of contracting authorities ensuring they implement it appropriately.</p></reply>

Failure to comply with this request is an offence. </p><p>  In relation to the auditor of a company, auditors are subject to ethical requirements included in the APB (FRC) Ethical Standards for Auditors and in the Codes of Ethics adopted by the Recognised Accountancy Bodies (&lsquo;RABs&rsquo;).  The Codes of Ethics adopted by the RABs derive from the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants&rsquo; (IESBA) Code of Ethics.  In general the ethical requirements provide that an auditor should: take reasonable steps to identify any threats to his or her independence and/or  possible conflicts of interest; evaluate any such threats including conflicts of interest; and take action to address any threats/conflicts of interest identified including not undertaking the work giving rise to the threat/conflict of interest if deemed appropriate.</p><p>  If in dealing with an accountant or auditor who is a member of  a prescribed accountancy body, a person, where not satisfied that the accountant or auditor has discharged his or her responsibilities fully and ethically, can make a complaint to the body in question, which must then apply its investigation and disciplinary procedures to the complaint. </p><p>  Where these procedures have been exhausted, that person can make a complaint to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Authority (&lsquo;IAASA&rsquo;).  If IAASA has reason to believe that the body&rsquo;s Investigation and Disciplinary Procedures may not have been complied with in that case, it may initiate an enquiry under the provisions of Section 23 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  Having completed such an enquiry, if IAASA is not satisfied that the body complied with its approved investigation and disciplinary procedures, IAASA may: annul all or part of a decision of that body relating to the matter, direct the body to conduct an investigation or a fresh investigation into the matter, require that body to pay to the Supervisory Authority an amount not exceeding &euro;125,000</p><p>  Under section 24 of the 2003 Act, following a complaint or on its own initiative, where, in its opinion, it is appropriate or in the public interest, IAASA can undertake an investigation into a possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body&rsquo;s standards by a member. If such a breach is found by IAASA, it may impose any sanction to which the member is liable under the rules of the body and an amount towards the costs incurred by it investigating and determining the case.</p></reply>

Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills and labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors.</p><p>  The numbers of employment permit applications submitted and issued have dropped since 2009 in line with economic conditions and the narrowing of eligible job categories and sectors where it was considered that a sufficient supply of labour exists.

As labour market conditions deteriorated, the eligible occupation categories were narrowed and other restrictions applied in line with the decline in employment opportunities and the emergence of an oversupply of labour.</p><p>  Eligible and ineligible categories of occupations for Employment Permits are determined, in line with the regular analyses of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (), Enterprise Development Agencies, and industry, with regard to labour market requirements.  These recently updated categories can be viewed at .</p><p>  On 10 April last, I announced a series of reforms to the EP system designed to encourage Ireland's attractiveness as a location for international mobile talent, particularly in the ICT sector.

I am satisfied that the agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit have properly observed all legal requirements in this regard, and that they are aware of the risks of non-compliance.  I will, however, ask the agencies to contact the Deputy directly in relation to the current contractual status of their CEO.</p></reply>

For indigenous Irish firms, also, talented graduates are crucial in the drive to develop innovative products and services and compete in an ever-changing market place.</p><p>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government is providing the basis for increased employment opportunities for graduates, particularly in growing and emerging sectors that rely on high knowledge and skills levels.  The Action Plan includes a number of measures that specifically support graduates.  </p><p>  In relation to my own Department, Enterprise Ireland operates programmes such as Graduates 4 International Growth, which is assists companies with ambitious growth plans in key markets to create one or more entry-level graduate market researcher positions.  Graduate market researchers work overseas for 12 months to complete a project related to the company&#8217;s growth plans in the overseas market.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland also runs the New Frontiers<b></b>  programme, which is an entrepreneur development programme delivered at a local level by the Institutes of Technology.  The programme provides successful applicants with a package of supports to help accelerate their business ideas and to equip them with the skills and contacts necessary to successfully start and grow their company. It may be of particular interest to new graduates.</p><p>  Science Foundation Ireland continue to promote the study of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) disciplines, to ensure that graduates have the knowledge and skills to avail of opportunities in high value-added sectors. </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs also includes commitments to support graduates in specific sectors such as the food industry and ICT.  One of the ambitions outlined in the Action Plan is that, by 2018, Ireland will have the highest percentage of computing graduates as a proportion of all tertiary graduates.  That process will begin in 2013 through a process of increased programme places, reskilling and conversion courses, and through targeted migration of key skills groups.</p><p>  In the area of labour market activation, the JobBridge scheme operated by the Minister for Social Protection has proven to be very successful in providing opportunities for young graduates to get valuable employment experience.  A recent review of the scheme, carried out by Indecon consultants, found that more than half of participants had gone on to paid employment after their internships ends.</p></reply>

Enforcing both competition and consumer laws will give the newly merged body synergies and efficiencies in carrying out its functions.  This will have benefits for consumers due to the existence of a stronger and more co-ordinated body dealing with consumer and competition issues.</p><p>  As regards the appointment of a new Chief Executive to the National Consumer Agency, that post is a statutory position under the Consumer Protection Act, 2007.  Following the decision of the previous CEO not to take up the offer of a new contract, sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to recruit a new Chief Executive given the need to ensure that the specific statutory functions of the CEO under the 2007 Act could continue to be carried out.  These include important functions such as being the accountable officer of the Agency before the Public Accounts Committee of the D&aacute;il and other relevant Committees of the Oireachtas, managing the staff, administration and business of the Agency, reporting to the Board of the Agency in relation to performance of the Agency&rsquo;s statutory functions etc. It is essential that these statutory functions continue to be carried out until the Agency is formally merged with the Competition Authority.</p><p>  The new CEO&rsquo;s contract is for a period of five years.  At the time of the advertisement for the CEO post, it was specifically indicated that the successful appointee would also be appointed as a Member-designate of the merged body.  When the merged body is formally established, following enactment of the Consumer and Competition Bill, the CEO will act as a Member of the new body. </p><p>  In appointing Ms. Isolde Goggin as Chairperson of the Competition Authority, I also appointed her to act as Chairperson-Designate of the merged body. The appointment of the Chairperson as Chairperson-Designate and the new CEO of the NCA and the existing Members of the Competition Authority as Members Designate of the proposed Consumer and Competition Authority is intended to allow both bodies to work together to bring their collective strengths, expertise and experience to bear so as to ensure that the transition to the merged body is as smooth as possible.</p></reply>

Enterprise support provided by my Department and its agencies is available to all, including persons with disabilities.  My Department would, however, input to such a strategy.</p><p>  My Department has commissioned disability audit reports and implemented a significant number of the recommendations in order to ensure insofar as is reasonably practicable that our buildings are as accessible as possible to all members of the public.  My Department exceeded the requirement to employ three per cent of persons with a disability for 2011 and continues to monitor performance in this regard.  As required under Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, the Department&rsquo;s Monitoring Committee met on several occasions in 2012 to monitor the three per cent target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Department&rsquo;s agencies.  The Committee submitted its Report via the Minister to the NDA by 30th June 2012.  Public bodies under the aegis of the Department will shortly be requested to report on the data collection for 2012.  The Department's Monitoring Committee will consider the data and compile the report for submission to the Minister and the NDA by 30th June 2013.</p></reply>

The Irish Government sent a tripartite delegation to the Conference comprised of Government delegates and delegates from IBEC and ICTU.</p><p>  The following Committees took place during the ILC: Committee on the Application of Standards; Elaboration of an autonomous recommendation on the Social Protection Floor (single discussion, standard setting); Committee on Youth Employment (general discussion); A recurrent discussion on the strategic objective of fundamental principles and rights at work.</p><p>  All reports in relation to each Committee, and the outcomes of the Committees, are available on the ILO&#8217;s website .  Specifically the following link: .</p><p>  The Government delegates covered the Committee on Youth Employment and the recurrent discussion on the strategic objective of fundamental principles and rights at work.</p><p>  They also monitored the difficulties that arose on the Committee on the Application of Standards (CAS).  The CAS regularly examines the application of standards in ILO member countries, and points out areas where they can be better applied. </p><p>  In June, 2012 the CAS, for the first time in the history of the ILO, could not reach agreement on the list of country cases for discussion and examination.  The country list is a matter that can only be decided by the Social Partners.  In this instance, the Employers had an issue with cases that referred to the right to strike i.e. Convention No. 87 (Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, 1948) and Convention No. 98 (Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining, 1949).  Considerable discussions were held by the ILO office and the Social Partners at that time, but no agreement could be reached to move the stalemate forward during the 2012 ILC.  It remains to be seen if there will be a country case list for discussion at this year&#8217;s ILC. </p><p>  During the third week of the Conference, my colleague Minister Sean Sherlock, Minister for Research and Innovation of this Department addressed the plenary session of the Conference. </p><p>  In relation to Ireland&#8217;s reporting obligations, Ireland has ratified 71 Conventions including all fundamental Conventions.  Ireland makes annual reports to the ILO in relation to the current position in relation to requested conventions.  As at 31<sup>st</sup> December, 2012, Ireland did not have any outstanding reporting obligations with the ILO.  The annual ILO request for 2013 has been received into my Department and officials are currently working on this request.</p><p>  The most recent Convention adopted in June, 2011 was the Decent Work for Domestic Workers Convention No. 189.  I intend to progress the ratification of this Convention both nationally and at EU level during the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

After a review of its operations, following a reduction in demand for the company's products, they have indicated that they expect to reduce the number of staff there by approximately 100 - 130.  This is expected to take place over a two-year period, as older, non-commercial product lines are phased out.</p><p>  The company will begin a consultation process with employees immediately and is committed to working with them during this period of transition.  They anticipate that the reduction in staff numbers will be achieved through a combination of natural attrition, voluntary redundancy and compulsory redundancy.  The company has stated that the Athlone plant will continue to play a strategic part in their future business, and the facility will remain strategically important to the company&rsquo;s global development and manufacturing network.</p><p>  IDA Ireland will remain in close contact with the company over the coming months. I have asked all the State agencies under my remit to continue to promote Athlone and the wider region for new industrial projects and enterprise development. </p><p>  It is of course very disappointing when redundancies such as these occur, arising due to changes in circumstances facing individual companies.  However, I would emphasise that job creation is central to this Government&rsquo;s plans for economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving our economy.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is crucial for this work, and it builds on the successful 2012 Plan, where we achieved considerable progress on a wide range of Actions and we are confident that this momentum will be maintained.</p></reply>

Its sole function is to adjudicate on disputes on individual employment rights.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any specific determination or award made by the Tribunal. </p><p>  I understand that the Tribunal made an award in favour of your constituent under the Unfair Dismissals Acts and the Minimum Notice and terms of Employment Acts on 3rd September, 2007.</p><p>  The enforcement of Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) determinations is a matter for the courts.  In cases other than those covered by the Payment of Wages Act, the Enforcement Services Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has some capacity to have a determination of the EAT enforced through the civil courts.</p><p>  Generally where an award has been made in favour of an employee, the employer has six weeks in which to comply.  If the employer fails to do so within this period, the employee or the employee&rsquo;s trade union may make an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to comply with the determination.  Where an employee is not in a position to do so, the matter can be referred to NERA Enforcement Services Unit, which may, in certain circumstances, make an application to the Courts for an order on his/her behalf.</p><p>  In deciding whether or not to intervene in the Minister&rsquo;s name, NERA would have regard to the amount of the award, the potential for achieving a favourable outcome for the claimant and the scale of the costs likely to be incurred in doing so.  The enforcement of a Circuit Court order in these circumstances is the responsibility of the relevant County Sheriff and my Department has no capacity to intervene.</p><p>  In circumstances where a determination has been made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in favour of employees, and the employer is legally insolvent, the employees are entitled to seek redress from the State through the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  However, where a company has been dissolved it no longer has a legal existence unless it is re-instated by order of the High Court. It may not therefore be regarded as continuing to qualify for the redress available otherwise under the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  As a consequence, this avenue would not be available in such cases as a means to payment of the amount sought.  In addition, NERA would not be in a position to pursue a case through the courts where the legal entity no longer exists.</p></reply>

It is a lump sum and in most cases is paid automatically, but some people need to claim.  The total amount of winter fuel payment can vary from &pound;100 - &pound;300 sterling having regard to age and household composition.  Most payments are made between mid- November and December in a given year.</p><p>  The European Court of Justice has recently ruled that people living outside the UK may be paid the winter fuel payment where they can demonstrate a &ldquo;genuine and sufficient link&rdquo; to the UK&rsquo;s social security system.</p><p>  My Department pays a fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week to qualified households who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or HSE payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  The fuel allowance season runs for 26 weeks from October to April each year.</p><p>  The implications of this ECJ judgment are currently being examined, in particular the implications for eligibility for the fuel allowance in Ireland, which is paid on the basis that an applicant is unable to provide for his or her own heating needs.</p></reply>

Eligibility for the Momentum initiative is determined by this Department, in line with the commitments given in Pathways to Work.  The key target is those who are long-term unemployed.  To be eligible for Momentum, a participant must: Be unemployed and on the Live Register for 12 months (312days) or longer; Be in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit payment from this Department or have credited contributions for 12 months or longer; and Be actively seeking work.</p><p>  A person in receipt of one parent family payment does not satisfy the criteria for Momentum as the focus is on those on the Live Register.

The Deputy should note that a person not on the Live Register has access to other education and training opportunities supported by the State.  The Momentum initiative represents a small percentage of the over 450,000 State-funded opportunities provided in 2012 in further education, higher education and training, namely: 75,000 F&Aacute;S training places in 2012; 180,000 Further Education places; 162,000 full-time Higher Education places, through Universities and Institutes of Technology across the country; Over 40,000 training places through Skillnets, including 8,000 for the unemployed, in partnership with private employers; and Over 6,000 Springboard free part-time higher education places in 2012, with additional places to be announced for this year.</p><p>  Eligibility for accessing many of these interventions is not contingent on receipt of a social welfare payment or signing for credited contributions.</p></reply>

The GRAG was an interdepartmental group comprising representatives from various Government Departments and Offices.  The Group engaged in a public consultation exercise which provided organisations and individuals with the opportunity to contribute their comments and proposals.  As part of this process, the Group met with some organisations and individuals, including those representing transgender persons.  The Report of the Group, which recommended a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July 2011.  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill.  In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March 2012 the Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues.  The formal opinion of the Attorney General was received in December 2012 and is currently under consideration by officials in this Department with a view to progressing the draft Heads of the Bill.</p><p>  There are a range of complex and sensitive issues involved in this proposed legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed.  I feel that the committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I hope that my appearance before the committee can be scheduled before the summer.  I believe this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas.  When the Oireachtas committee has discussed the provisional draft heads of Bill I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.1289.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRW00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 581 and 582 together.</p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  It is essential that this is achieved while providing value for money for tenants and the taxpayer.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  As the Department funds a significant proportion of private sector rented accommodation, it is essential that State supports for rents are kept under review and that appropriate control and compliance measures are in place.  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  The tenant's engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord.  The fact that approximately 86,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation.</p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement which will return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for Housing and Planning.  The Government approved in principle the transfer of responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  The Department is working closely with officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.</p></reply>

The robust registration process, leading to the issuing of a PSC which incorporates both a person&rsquo;s  photograph and signature, gives significant assurance as to the identity of the cardholder.  From the Department's perspective, as well as combating identity fraud, the PSC will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel Card, with a highly secure card.  </p><p>  Fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements are classed as biometric information.  This is information about human body characteristics and it is typically used for authentication purposes. The data that the PSC can store can include biometric information.  </p><p>  Biometric data does not, of itself, eliminate fraud.  What it can do is associate a particular individual with a particular set of human characteristics.  The selected biometric information can later be obtained from the individual and checked against the stored information, thus confirming that the same individual provided both sets of information.  Any relying system would need secure registration and identification processes and the ability to read and measure biometric information throughout.  The cost of this infrastructure would be dependent on the specific biometric selected but as the infrastructure (readers etc.) would need to be widely deployed, it would be significant.  In summary, the PSC itself can support the use of biometrics but there are many other issues to be considered.  </p><p>  Existing legislation in the context of the PSC does not provide for biometrics and currently there are no plans to alter that.  These provisions do, however, provide for the collection and storage of photographs or images and, in this context, the Department has recently deployed a facial image matching software to help detect and deter duplicate SAFE registrations.  Where a match or a potential match is discovered, the relevant records will be referred to an officer in the Department's Client Identity Services Division for investigation and resolution.  Processes have also been put in place to refer suspected cases of identity fraud to the Department's Special Investigation Unit, if required.</p></reply>

Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  There has been significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  Processing times have been reduced by 10.3 weeks overall in 2012  with respect to 2011, with time for an oral hearing time down by 13 weeks and the time for summary decision up by 2.7 weeks.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012, when 32,558 cases were finalised.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial process, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that while every effort is made to deal with appeals as fast as possible this cannot be at the expense of fairness of due process.</p><p>  The total number of Medical Assessors in the Department of Social Protection can vary at different times, due to retirements and recruitments.  In January 2012, there were 26 Medical Assessors, including the Chief Medical Adviser and the Deputy Chief Medical Adviser.  The total number reduced down to 23 by the end of 2012.  At present there are 25 Medical Assessors and there are plans to increase this number by a further 4 later in the year.</p></reply>

In 2013, my Department will spend an estimated &euro;284 million on the household benefits scheme, providing some 410,000 customers with a package worth almost &euro;700 per year.  Separate to the household benefits package, some 410,000 customers will receive the fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week paid for 26 weeks, at a cost of &euro;211 million.  The structure of the electricity and gas allowance was changed from a unit based allowance to a cash credit which is currently &euro;35 per month.  This rate is aligned to the best average market rate currently available.  The changed structure of the allowance is designed to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility between energy suppliers who can best meet their individual energy needs.</p><p>  There has been no policy U-turn in relation to unused gas/electricity credits.  In fact, the new arrangement represents a significant improvement in the options available for customers.  Customers who do not use their full entitlement each month will be able to carry forward that unused cash credit and draw it down as they wish; this includes customers who wish to switch to a different supplier.  Prior to these changes, customers with Electric Ireland could not carry forward their unused credits if they switched to a new supplier; this acted as an impediment to customers achieving the best value for their particular energy needs.  Under the new arrangement, customers with Electric Ireland who build up cash credits will have those credits refunded if they switch to a different company.  As regards the old non-cash units, a number of customers have unused units which they have carried over from 2012.  These customers may use these unused units up to the end of September, 2013. My Department has contacted customers in this regard.</p><p>  My Department pays a fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week to qualified households who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or HSE payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  The fuel allowance season runs for 26 weeks from October to April each year and not 20.  The fuel allowance season was due to end on 5 April 2013 but because of the very cold weather at the start of April, the allowance was paid for an extra week at this time of year.  It should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s older population has the lowest rate of consistent poverty - 1.9% compared with the whole population rate of 6.9% - and, as a group are least likely to be at risk of poverty.  This points to the adequacy and importance of the State pension and other supports provided by my Department.</p></reply>

Eures was established by the European Commission in 1993 to facilitate the free movement of workers throughout the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA).  Freedom of movement of workers is one of the four freedoms established under the Maastricht treaty in 1992.  This involves all member states exchanging job vacancies with each other and ensuring that job vacancies in Europe are available to all citizens/job seekers of Europe.</p><p>  We received a request from the Public Employment Service in Malta on 19 February to assist them fill up to 200 jobs for bus drivers in Malta. In addition to advertising the jobs, we identified 320 jobseekers who, according to our records had the necessary qualifications to be considered for these jobs.  We subsequently wrote to these jobseekers advising them of the availability of the jobs and 33 responded with applications for the positions and interviews are currently being organised for 22 of these candidates.  All jobs advertised by the Public Employment Services of the Member States are advertised on the Eures portal <i></i>and are made available to every citizen of EU/EEA on an equal basis.  Currently there are over 1 million vacancies available.  Although, there is no compulsion on jobseekers to apply for such jobs, it is important that they are aware of, and have the opportunity to compete for jobs in other countries.  The Department for its part has a duty and a responsibility to ensure that jobseekers in Ireland are not disadvantaged relative to jobseekers in other countries.</p></reply>

As at 11 April, 2013, 16,326 internships have commenced with 5,944 participants on an internship and 2,410 internship opportunities advertised on  as of that date.  The recent interim independent evaluation of the scheme conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements.  This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe, suggesting that JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention.  The Department has stringent measures in place to monitor internships and to investigate alleged abuse of the scheme.  Each advertisement is vetted by the National Contact Centre for compliance with scheme criteria.  The eligibility of interns is assessed before they are permitted to commence an internship.  Host organisations are required to complete monthly monitoring returns.  Host organisations are subject to random monitoring visits by officers of the Department.  Of the more than 1,600 monitoring visits conducted to date, 97% of internships monitored were found to be operating satisfactorily with remedial action taken in the remaining 3% of cases.  The procedures for registering a query or complaint are addressed in the Contact Us section of the JobBridge website<i></i>.</p><p>  In addition to regular monitoring, the Department has received 218 complaints that have warranted investigation since the scheme commenced.  A total of 15 breaches of the scheme criteria were found to be of a sufficiently serious nature so as to warrant the exclusion of the host organisation from participation in the scheme.  The following were some of the key breaches of the scheme: standard Agreement not completed; appropriate Mentoring/Development not being provided; not adhering to Compliance Requirements; and displacement issues.  However, it is important to highlight that the overwhelming majority of companies are abiding by the terms and conditions of the scheme.  In fact, over 7,500 host organisations have commenced interns since the scheme began, of which a total of 15 companies have been disqualified due to breaches of the scheme.  Our analysis indicates that 58% of all interns have left their internship early.  While this may appear to be of immediate concern, it is reassuring to highlight that 66% of these interns completed their internship early to take up immediate employment with either their host organisation or another company.</p></reply>

Recent developments have focused on CE schemes involved in supporting community childcare services and on CE participants who wish to pursue a career in child care while on CE.  These developments reflect the findings of a number of recent reviews - the "CE Financial Review of Schemes&rdquo; (2012) and the &ldquo;Review of Department of Social Protection Employment Support Schemes" (2012).  In response, the Department is planning a number of improvements which will provide a clear career progression path and a structure for CE participants in Early Years Services.  The Department is proposing to change and improve the provision of training and work experience for CE participants who wish to pursue a career in child care.  This involves putting in place entry requirements, defined standards of achievement, a career progression path, and a structure for CE workers in Early Years Services.  These changes will provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community childcare and achieve greater coherence between participation on CE and the job market.</p><p>  For CE participants who work directly with children a dedicated programme is proposed which comprises of formal learning (a FETAC Level 5 childcare qualification) and supervised work experience.  In acknowledgement of the training a participant will commit to undertaking participation on a child-care place will have a duration of three years.  This programme is currently being piloted in the Midlands North Region and an evaluation of the programme will take place before a national roll-out is undertaken.</p></reply>

It is designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third-level education by enabling eligible people on certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</p><p>  In general, the qualifying period for the second-level option is 3 months (78 days) on a social welfare payment while the qualifying period for third-level courses is 9 months (234 days), having been reduced from 12 months in 2010. A person awarded statutory redundancy may access BTEA immediately (or within 12 months), provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  </p><p>  A waiting period prior to entitlement is considered essential to enable people to engage in job search and consider options available to them.  The imposition of a waiting period serves to minimise the &ldquo;deadweight&rdquo; element which is the extent to which people would have moved into employment or training and education without access to the scheme.  It is also considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.</p><p>  The Department has recently published a review of employment support schemes, including BTEA, and held a stakeholders&rsquo; forum where review recommendations were discussed. All recommendations, including those on eligibility and qualification conditions of BTEA, will be considered as part of the implementation phase of the review.</p></reply>

The Department agreed to grant to the person concerned from the scheme&rsquo;s Administration and Training Grant until the completion of the then current contract which ended on June 1st   2012. The sponsors of the scheme were advised that the grant aid would cease on this date. All contracts for schemes are appraised on an annual basis and any contract and the terms contained within only have a maximum duration of one annual year.</p><p>  Upon renewal, the current scheme contract was given approval for 49 workers who would be supported by funding for two full-time team leaders. The current ratios are in keeping with the recommended ratio of team leaders to workers which also includes the provision of administration. It is not possible to provide funding for additional administrative support.  </p><p>  While the Department provides funding to the Job Initiative scheme, sponsors for each scheme are required to have a Management Committee which is the registered employer for any staff pertaining to that scheme.  Any matters relating to contracts of employment for those employed through the funding of the Department are within the remit of the registered employer. The Department can only offer guidance in relation to the operating guidelines of the scheme and it would not be appropriate for the Department to engage with the Labour Relations Commission in this matter.  </p></reply>

There are currently approximately 13,000 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided some &euro;42 million for in 2013.     To ensure that those who are in mortgage difficulty engage with their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and avail of its forbearance arrangements, from June 2012 the mortgage interest supplement is not payable until applicants have agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months. This process acknowledges that it is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower to address financial difficulties as speedily and effectively as circumstances allow. </p><p>  In December 2012, to facilitate people who wish to trade down or downsize, the condition which provided that entitlement to mortgage interest supplement should be discontinued where the property is offered for sale was removed.  The removal of this condition will allow persons to engage in selling their residence and remain eligible for mortgage interest supplement, subject to the other conditions of the scheme. </p><p>  The Department has not carried out a review of all mortgage interest supplement cases earlier this year, however claims are reviewed on an on-going basis as part of the control of the scheme. </p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million for 2013. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by a local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. </p><p>  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. </p><p>  However, where a claimant&rsquo;s safety and wellbeing are at risk due to domestic violence Department officials operating the rent supplement scheme have discretionary powers to expedite the award of a payment to the person in question.  </p><p>  Policy in relation to the assessment of housing need is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p></reply>

The two main weekly income support payments are the means tested carer&rsquo;s allowance (including half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance) paid to almost 54,000 people and the PRSI based carer&rsquo;s benefit paid to almost 1,700 people. </p><p>  In addition to these payments, non-resident carers continue to be entitled to the annual respite care grant and free travel.  The income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for maximum payment carer&rsquo;s allowance which such a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate. </p><p>  I have no plans to review the provision of household benefits, including the telephone allowance, for carers who are not living with the person for whom they provide care.  For those who do reside with the person being cared for, the person being cared for is likely to already have an entitlement of their own to household benefits.

Following a review of the defined benefit model which was completed in 2011, I introduced a requirement for defined benefit pension schemes to hold a risk reserve which was designed to protect the interest of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. I also introduced a range of options which will assist trustees of schemes in meeting this requirement. In view of current funding difficulties experienced by many defined benefit schemes, schemes will have until the end of 2023 to satisfy this requirement.</p><p>  You will appreciate that the issue of how the assets of a pension scheme are distributed on the wind-up of a pension scheme is a complex and sensitive issue and one which requires careful consideration before any change is made to the current provisions. In this regard, my officials have completed a detailed review of these provisions which involved engagement with stakeholder representatives and with external consultants who provided valuable assistance in reviewing this issue. </p><p>  The outcome of this review is being considered at present.</p></reply>

This Job Initiative scheme is now sponsored by Dublin 12 Congress Centre and it is funded by this Department. The Department agreed to grant to the person concerned from the scheme&rsquo;s Administration and Training Grant until the completion of the then current contract which ended on June 1st   2012. The sponsors of the scheme were advised that the grant aid would cease on this date. All contracts for schemes are appraised on an annual basis and any contract and the terms contained within only have a maximum duration of one annual year.</p><p>  Upon renewal, the current scheme contract was given approval for 49 workers who would be supported by funding for two full-time team leaders. The current ratios are in keeping with the recommended ratio of team leaders to workers which also includes the provision of administration. It is not possible to provide funding for additional administrative support.  </p><p>  The sponsors were informed of the decision prior to the cessation of funding and they have been corresponded with on a number of occasions regarding this matter. Accordingly, a meeting would not provide any further clarification and would serve no useful purpose.</p></reply>

The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.  </p><p>  To qualify for participation, an individual must be actively farming <b>and</b>   in receipt of either farm assist, jobseekers allowance, jobseekers benefit (if previously on CE or RSS within the last 12 months), disability allowance, one-parent family payment, widow/er&#8217;s pension (contributory or non-contributory), or be under 66 and have an increase for a qualified adult paid on his/her spouse&#8217;s old-age non-contributory pension.</p><p>  The Department&#8217;s records indicate that the individual concerned does not currently fall into any of the above categories.  If, on completion of his CE engagement, he becomes eligible for jobseekers benefit and provided he is actively farming and has access to a valid herd number, he should contact his local implementing body to establish whether there are any vacancies on the RSS in County Clare.

Despite high levels of internet penetration in Ireland, studies indicate that the number of older people who do not use the internet for personal transactions is high.  A significant number of our customers fall into this category and the Department adopts the general approach of interacting with these customers through more traditional and secure communication channels. The nature of some of my Department&rsquo;s communications also means that email is not always suitable (e.g. cheque payments or control activity).</p><p>My Department uses electronic communications through its website and through individual communication; for example, it uses SMS texting to correspond with some customers. The range of electronic forms and information available to customers via our website (<i><i>www.welfare.ie</i></i>  ) has also been increasing.  As ICT options are further developed internally and externally, my Department will use electronic communications as much as possible and will keep the issue under review.</p></reply>

Where a written request for information is received from an Oireachtas member, the response issues in writing, either by post or email, depending on the initial request.</p><p>  To facilitate the speedy resolution of queries and requests for information from Oireachtas members, the Department has provided lists of designated contact telephone numbers and email addresses for various business areas and these are used by members on a regular basis.</p><p>  The Department takes a pro-active approach to communicating information on legislative and other changes to Oireachtas members.  In 2012, this involved emailing members with information on, for example, changes to the State pension scheme and arrangements in respect of Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance. This approach will continue to be followed for other information campaigns undertaken by the Department.</p><p>  As part of its commitment to minimising costs, the Department of Social Protection is continually reviewing its information and service delivery model.  The Department also has a duty of care to its customers to safeguard their personal information, as provided for under the Data Protection Acts.   Any future initiatives involving the electronic transfer of customer information will be considered in the context of the security and reliability of the means of transfer, email or otherwise.</p></reply>

This process has involved building advocacy capacity and skills in Citizens Information Services   to deliver advocacy to all citizens including those with a disability who are able to access mainstream services.  </p><p>  The establishment of a Personal Advocacy Service was deferred by the previous Government in 2008 due to budgetary constraints. An evaluation report on the community and voluntary sector advocacy programme in 2009 set out a suggested new structure for the roll out of advocacy services and recommended the establishment of a single service to provide improved advocacy services to people who need them, regardless of location, disability type or level of vulnerability.</p><p>  Following on from this report, the National Advocacy Service was established under the Citizens Information Board in January 2011, to provide an independent, confidential and free, representative advocacy service to vulnerable people with disabilities who cannot self- advocate, while supporting others to use mainstream services. The budget assigned to the National Advocacy Service in 2013 is &euro;3.8m</p><p>  During 2011 the service was established across the country.  The service is managed by five Citizens Information Services in Dublin (Clondalkin), Westmeath, Offaly, Waterford and Leitrim and staffed by five managers, 35 advocates (full-time equivalents) and five administrators.</p><p>  The aim of the National Advisory Service is to ensure that the voices of people with disabilities are heard and their rights safeguarded. The Service has a particular remit for people with disabilities who cannot self-refer, who are isolated in the community, or living in residential institutions. </p><p>  The National Advocacy Service has been in operation for almost two years and a review of all aspects of the service is currently underway.  The review will be completed this year and I will then consider this is further detail. </p></reply>

To-date, 16,326 placements have commenced.  Of which, 556 placements have commenced in County Waterford.  Of those in County Waterford, 356 individuals have now finished their internship and 200 individuals are currently on an internship.  Of the 356 individuals who have finished their internship, 126,(36%) stated that they went directly into employment, either with their host organisation or with another employer, immediately on completion of their internship. This figure excludes interns who would have entered employment in the weeks subsequent to completing the internship.</p><p>An independent evaluation of JobBridge carried out by conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements. This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe, suggesting that JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention.  If internships in County Waterford follow the national trend it would mean that 217 individuals would have found employment within 5 months of finishing their internship.

In particular, there will be a need for additional after-school child care provision so as to assist former OFP recipients to make their transition into employment or other activation supports.   This new scheme will provide 6,000 subsidised after-school child care places for social welfare income support recipients who enter employment and have children of primary school age.   Officials from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department of Education and Skills have worked closely to finalise the scope and parameters of the scheme.  This initiative will be rolled out on a nationwide basis during 2013 commencing with a pilot of 500 places in late April, 2013 across 7 Intreo and Social Welfare Local Offices.  </p><p>  The availability of these additional after-school child care places is a positive measure for lone parents and builds on my pledge to work to address the child care needs of lone parents in light of the reforms that are being carried out on the OFP scheme.  In addition, I have postponed the commencement date of the reductions to the age of the youngest child for receipt of the OFP payment from January, 2013, to July, 2013.</p><p>  I think I have always been clear that my policy objective is to incentivise people of working age to work and this includes lone parents. All of the evidence shows that work is the best route out of poverty for parents and children. Activation is therefore a critical policy tool which I have ensured underpins the approach of my Department. I do of course keep this and all policy matters relating to working age payments under review. The Deputy will be aware that the Social Welfare Bill has not yet been published or approved by Government so I am not in a position to comment further on its contents. </p></reply>

The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.</p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe. A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well. The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system. A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient. </p><p>  I have no further plans for the respite care grant this year.</p></reply>

A period of employment in 1971, even if deemed insurable, would not be sufficient to increase her overall record in order to satisfy the qualifying conditions.  </p><p>  It is open to anybody to apply for retrospective recognition of a commercial partnership. Spouses who have been actively engaged in a partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria. The Department has no record of the person concerned applying for recognition of a commercial partnership. If she wishes to make such application, she can do so to the Department&rsquo;s Scope Section, Ois&iacute;n House, 212-213 Pearse Street, Dublin 2.  Her application will be investigated. If the existence of a commercial partnership is recognised, following the payment of any assessed self-employed PRSI liability, her State pension (contributory) claim will be reviewed and she will be notified of the outcome without delay.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p><p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers.  The policy framework allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p><p>  It should be noted that Mullingar has been connected to the gas network for a number of years.</p><p>  As regards the position for Longford, the most recent assessment was undertaken a number of years ago.  Having full regard to CER&rsquo;s network connections policy, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns not already connected to the national gas network, with detailed economic analysis based on criteria outlined in the policy.  The study was published in April 2010 following approval by the CER.  The study included an appraisal of Longford as one of a group of towns.  The Gaslink report found that 35 towns, including Longford, when appraised on an individual basis or as a group, did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.</p><p>Gaslink continues to keep under review the towns which did not qualify for connection under that study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town, or group of towns, in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.  </p></reply>

The rise in disconections in recent years has coincided with the economic recession which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.</p><p>  In line with the CER&#8217;s Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  According to CER&#8217;s published report on its website on Electricity and Gas Retail Markets, concerning the period to the end of September 2012, over 11,000 Pay as You Go electricity meters have been installed.  That report also states that there are approximately 19,500 token meters in operation.  In relation to gas the report states that for the period to end of September 2012, 63,933 Pay as You Go and token meters are installed, with 36,109 installed since December 2008.  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement. </p><p>  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised, and only occur as a very last resort.</p><p>  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.</p><p>  In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &#8364;18 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in over 10,000 homes.  </p></reply>

Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER. </p><p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of Community Based Organisations, augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are provided free of charge to the customer.</p><p>  Despite the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to continuing to deliver energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;17 million for 2013.  It is anticipated that the scheme will deliver upgrades to approximately 10,000 homes this year.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (i.e. pay-as-you-save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to the residential and non-residential sectors.</p><p>  The key benefit to the homeowner of such a financing mechanism is that the scheme will allow them to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes, and in the process remove one of the key energy efficiency barriers.  The consumer will also benefit through the creation of a robust quality assurance process that will protect consumers and ensure high-quality workmanship.</p><p>  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key state and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken later this year.  I would stress, however, that it is my intention, in the context of the introduction of a Pay As You Save scheme, that the grant scheme aimed at those on low incomes, will remain in existence.  </p></reply>

It was the developer&#8217;s intention to complete this survey in 2012 but this was not possible for technical and poor weather reasons.  The developer is now planning to acquire the remainder of the 3D OBC survey over the Corrib Gas Field in 2013.</p><p>  I would like to explain the background to the assessment of this application as follows. Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27th June 1985, as amended, on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (&#8216;EIA Directive&#8217;) put in place a system whereby certain projects by reason of their type, size, location, etc.,<i></i>  must be assessed as to their likely effects on the environment through the process of Environmental Impact Assessment.  On the 21st of May 1992, the European Community adopted Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna.  An Appropriate Assessment is required under the Habitats Directive for any plan or project likely to have significant effect on an internationally important site for nature conservation. </p><p>  While geophysical surveys are not specifically listed as requiring assessment under the EIA Directive, as a precautionary measure, my Department undertook a screening of the Corrib 3D OBC Seismic Survey application with respect to the requirements of both the EIA and the Habitats Directives which concluded that,  &#8220;No EIA is considered necessary due to the limited extent and duration of the operation and in light of the existing requirements under the scope and quality requirements set out or implied by specific European and Irish legislation and guidelines&#8221;, and with regard to the Habitats Directive, &#8220;This screening has established that the survey poses no risk of a significant effect on the West Connaught Coast SAC and as such requires no further Appropriate Assessment&#8221;.</p><p>  Cetaceans are addressed in the developer&#8217;s Environmental Statement as being listed under Annex IV of the Habitats Directive and thus strictly protected.  It is concluded within the reports that the localised and temporary nature of the operation means that no &#8216;Wildlife Disturbance Licence&#8217; is required.  The &#8216;Wildlife Disturbance Licence&#8217; is in reference to the &#8216;derogation licence&#8217; under Regulation 54 of S.I. 477/2011 ( European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011) and complying with the requirements of the provisions of Regulations 51, 52 and 53 and in particular the protection of fauna, Regulation 51 (2) which states: &#8220;Notwithstanding any consent, statutory or otherwise, given to a person by a public authority or held by a person, except in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister under Regulation 54, a person who in respect of the species referred to in Part 1 of the First Schedule &#8212;</p><p>... (b) deliberately disturbs these species particularly during the period of breeding, rearing, hibernation and migration&#8221; ... Shall be guilty of an offence.&#8221;</p><p>  No derogation licence is required where no significant disturbance is caused and where the proposed activity can be timed, organised and carried out in a manner that will not constitute an offence under Irish wildlife legislation, as is the case with the Corrib 3D Seismic Survey.</p><p>Permission was therefore granted to the developer on 4 March, 2013 to undertake the 3D OBC Seismic Survey in the Slyne Basin.  This survey is currently being carried out.   </p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Waterford, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie  .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme and the Rural Broadband Scheme.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has identified, following the evaluation of tender responses to a request for experts, the preferred bidder to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County Waterford, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p></reply>

Late last year the Government agreed with my decision on cost grounds not to proceed with an application to the European Commission for State Aid clearance for a higher priced feed in tariff to support offshore wind development in the Irish electricity market.</p><p>  While offshore wind is already being deployed in several Member States as part of delivering on their national renewable energy targets, it is still a very expensive technology to deploy, typically costing double the price of deploying onshore wind.  Offshore wind currently costs in the region of &euro;3 million per megawatt to deploy compared to the cost of onshore wind which is around &euro;1.5 million per megawatt. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s deployment of renewable energy sources in electricity has been increasing steadily in recent years as we work North and South, to deliver a 40% level of renewable electricity consumption by 2020.  There has been good progress from 5% renewable electricity in 2005 to around 17% renewable electricity at present.  The challenge is to steadily increase renewable electricity generation in the all island market from onshore wind and biomass year on year towards 2020.</p><p>  However, in order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and at the same time ensure that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government &ndash; in conjunction with my Department and other stakeholders &ndash; is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006.  This review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker.  </p></reply>

Best practice Wind Energy Guidelines were also published in 2006. Currently, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government &ndash; in conjunction with my Department and other stakeholders &ndash; is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the 2006 guidelines.

The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  CER issued its Gate 3 direction in December 2008 (CER 08/260 available at www.cer.ie).  This sets out the list of renewable generators entitled to a grid connection offer under the Gate 3 process.  The Department monitors the number of windfarms connected to the grid and contracted to connect to the grid (i.e. that have accepted their grid connection offers).

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Tipperary, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme<b>. </b>  NBS services are available within 50 of the 177 Electoral Divisions in County Tipperary and I have attached a list of these Electoral Divisions.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has identified, following the evaluation of tender responses to a request for experts, the preferred bidder to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County Tipperary, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p><b>Electoral Divisions (ED) Covered by the NBS in County Tipperary</b></p><p><b>ED NameED Reference No.</b></p><p><table><tr><td>ABINGTON <br />AGHNAMEADLE <br />ARDFINNAN <br />BALLYCAHILL <br />BALLYCARRON <br />BALLYGRIFFIN <br />BALLYLUSKY <br />BORRISOKANE <br />BRUIS <br />BURNCOURT<br />CARRIG <br />CLOGHER <br />CLOGHPRIOR <br />CLONBEG <br />CLONEEN<br />COOLAGARRANROE<br />CULLEN <br />CURRAHEEN <br />DERRYGRATH <br />DOLLA <br />EMLY <br />FINNOE <br />FOILNAMAN <br />GARRANGIBBON <br />GLENGAR <br />GOLDEN <br />GORTKELLY <br />INCH <br />KILBARRON <br />KILCORAN <br />KILLAVINOGE <br />KILLEENASTEENA <br />KILNANEAVE <br />KILPATRICK <br />LACKAGH <br />LATTERAGH <br />LATTIN <br />MOYALIFF <br />OUGHTERLEAGUE <br />POYNTSTOWN <br />RODUS <br />SHRONELL<br />TEMPLEDERRY <br />TEMPLETOUHY <br />TERRYGLASS <br />THOMASTOWN <br />TIMONEY <br />TUBBRID <br />TULLAGHMELAN <br />TWO MILE BORRIS </td><td>ED 217001<br /> ED 217002<br />ED 217006<br />ED 217013<br /> ED 217014<br />ED 217017<br /> ED 217019<br />ED 217030<br />ED 217034<br />ED 217037<br />ED 217043<br />ED 217049<br />ED 217051<br />ED 217053<br />ED 217054<br />            ED 217060<br />ED 217063<br />ED 217064<br />ED 217066<br />ED 217067<br /> ED 217072<br />ED 217075<br />ED 217076<br /> ED 217078<br /> ED 217079<br />ED 217081<br />ED 217082<br /> ED 217088<br />ED 217090<br /> ED 217095<br /> ED 217100<br /> ED 217102<br /> ED 217108<br /> ED 217110<br />ED 217117<br /> ED 217118<br />ED 217119<br />ED 217131<br />             ED 217142<br />ED 217144<br /> ED 217151<br />ED 217153<br /> ED 217155<br />ED 217158<br /> ED 217159<br />ED 217160<br />ED 217163<br /> ED 217167<br /> ED 217168<br />             ED 217171</td></tr></table></p></reply>

An acreage report and a concession map showing the areas subject to authorisations, as at 31 December 2012, is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p> </p><p>  The process for the award of authorisations is outlined in the Act and in a Departmental publication entitled &ldquo;Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production 2007&rdquo;.  This document is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p> </p><p>  Potential oil and gas bearing areas in Irish waters which are currently the subject of exploration activities are by their very nature, prospective, and as such not amenable to value estimation.</p><p>  There have been four commercial natural gas discoveries since exploration began offshore Ireland in the early 1970s, namely the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) producing gas fields off the coast of Cork and the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.</p><p>  The Kinsale area gas fields are now nearing depletion and currently provide approximately 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas requirements.  The Corrib gas field is under development and first gas is not anticipated before late 2014.  All four gas fields are held under petroleum leases issued by my Department.  </p><p>  In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%.  In addition, royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.</p><p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field or from future production from the Corrib gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.  Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production.  A comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing terms was carried out in 2007 following which both the fiscal and non-fiscal licensing terms were revised.</p><p>  The revised Terms seek to strike a balance between attracting those willing to invest in high-risk exploration while at the same time ensuring the State receives a fair share of profits where a commercial discovery is made.</p><p>  The revised licensing terms provide for a new profit resource rent tax of up to 15% in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate previously applying.  The revised terms ensure that the return to the State will increase to a maximum of 40% in the case of the most profitable fields. The revised terms apply to all exploration licences issued since the beginning of 2007.</p><p>  Countries that have petroleum production use a range of models to obtain a financial return from their natural resources.  These models vary both in terms of the instruments used and in terms of the level of take which the State seeks to obtain.  Some countries use a combination of instruments, such as: State participation in licences; production royalties; along with taxation, while other countries, including Ireland, take an approach that is principally based on taxing profits.  Each country&rsquo;s fiscal system tends to have its own individual characteristics. </p><p>  In determining the appropriate approach at a national level a range of factors must be considered, with the principal factor being the relative prospectivity of the area.  Directly replicating the fiscal regime of another country is unlikely to provide the optimum outcome.  Regard must also be had to the approach adopted by countries with whom we are directly competing for a share of international exploration investment.</p><p>  While there has been a modest but welcome upturn in the level of interest in exploration off our coast in recent years, the reality is that the only commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons made in the Irish offshore to date are the three producing gas fields in the Kinsale area and the Corrib gas field.</p><p>  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore basins, as demonstrated by a number of non-commercial discoveries as well as other oil and gas indicators such as hydrocarbon shows in wells.</p><p>  Nevertheless, the oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells being drilled from the current levels of 1 to 2 wells per year.</p><p>  To this end my Department encourages exploration investment through an active and targeted promotion campaign, regular licensing rounds and by supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  Maintaining an appropriate fiscal regime is also critical to attracting this much need exploration investment to Ireland.</p><p>  Ireland does not have proven resources equivalent to those of Norway, and as such Ireland&rsquo;s tax terms for oil and gas production are deliberately aimed at attracting new investment and are set at a level comparable to countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production and proven resources and with whom we compete for exploration investment.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.</p><p>  The practice of insulating dormer roofs/sloped ceilings under the Warmer Homes scheme was reviewed late last year by the SEAI on foot of rapidly escalating costs.  Sloping roofs present particular challenges, as insulation can only be installed in part of the roof space. Achieving sufficient ventilation, as required by the Building Regulations, to avoid condensation problems can be extremely costly.  As a result, it has been decided that the significant additional costs cannot generally be justified by the marginal insulation gains. However, in a small number of instances alternative technical solutions may be possible. SEAI is in the process of reviewing all applications where sloping roofs are present and will contact relevant homeowners if an appropriate solution can be found.  </p><p>  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hotline can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to oireachtas@seai.ie and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to those that are vulnerable to energy poverty and who live in privately-owned dwellings.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of Community Based Organisations, augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer. There are a number of alternative retrofit programmes, funded by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, that are available to those living in social housing. </p><p>  Despite the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to continuing to deliver energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;17 million for 2013.  It is anticipated that the scheme will deliver upgrades to approximately 10,000 homes this year.</p><p>The scheme is an important element of the Affordable Energy Strategy that was launched in November 2011.  The Strategy aims to target people experiencing energy poverty regardless of tenancy, be it private or social housing. In this regard, the SEAI along with my Department are currently undertaking a pilot programme involving two Local Authorities.  The pilot will test a number of delivery mechanisms in providing energy retrofits to a targeted group of low-income families living in Local Authority housing within the Longford County Council and South Dublin County Council districts.  The outcome of the pilot will inform future policy in this regard.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.1723.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRDD02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 750 and 808 together.  </p><p>  The Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 provide the statutory framework to combat the litter problem.  Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering is, in the first instance, a matter for local authorities.</p><p>  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally, within the legislation provided, including the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean up actions in relation to litter, taking account of its own local circumstances and priorities.</p><p>  Penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.  </p><p>  In 2010, over 18,000 litter fines were issued by local authorities, who also spent approximately &euro;100 million nationally on litter control and prevention. The latest figures available from my Department&rsquo;s National Litter Pollution Monitoring System demonstrate that the litter situation is continuing to improve across the country. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place, my Department is preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of on-the-spot fines for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping.  I expect to be in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval shortly.</p><p>  As the Minister with responsibility for this area, I encourage a multi-facetted approach to tackling the litter problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education.  As such, my Department supports several anti-litter initiatives to combat litter in Ireland including:</p><p>  - National Spring Clean;</p><p>  - Green Schools Program;</p><p>  - Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) &ndash; Litter League;</p><p>  - Tidy Towns;</p><p>  - Local Authority Anti-Litter &amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme;</p><p>  - Negotiated Agreement with the Banking and Chewing Gum industries.</p><p>  Under the Anti-Litter &amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme, which my Department has co-funded for local authorities since 1997, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.  The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to litter, including the issue of dog fouling, and since 2008, graffiti. They should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action. Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets. The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions. A total of &euro;1,000,000 was made available to fund suitable projects under the scheme in 2012. A similar level of funding has been allocated to the scheme in 2013.</p><p>  During the summer months of 2012, I also launched a national litter campaign by way of a negotiated agreement with the National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI), NNI Local &amp; Regional, the Regional Newspapers and Printers Association of Ireland (RNPAI) and Magazines Ireland. The campaign was picked up by the majority of national and regional press as well as other local publications. Also in 2012, a &euro;750,000 local authority litter enforcement grant scheme, specifically designed to allow local authorities put in place measures to tackle these issues was introduced.</p><p>  I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people is key to effecting a long term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal but ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme. The Water Services Act 2013 assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme. </p><p>  The procurement process for the metering programme is underway. The criteria for the procurement process were developed by my Department, in consultation with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, to ensure that SMEs have an opportunity to compete for contracts. The tender criteria have been developed to ensure that sub-contractors have the capacity to carry out the scale of work involved to the necessary high standard. The approach being taken for the sub-contractor panel is consistent with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on facilitating SME participation in public procurement (that Department&rsquo;s Circular 10/10 refers). It is expected that the regional management contractors, who will be appointed in May 2013, will be utilising the resources of the pre-qualified sub-contractors for the purpose of delivering the meter installation works. It is expected that the installation of meter boxes and domestic water meters will commence in July 2013 and will be rolled out as quickly as possible thereafter. </p><p>  The 2013 Act also assigns to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) the power to advise the Government on the development of a regulatory framework for water services. The Government intends assigning to CER a full range of regulatory powers before the commencement of domestic water charges. This will include powers to set tariffs as well as the establishment of customer protection measures. In this regard, Irish Water will be obliged to meet customer service standards set by CER. </p><p>  Water meters used for domestic billing must comply with the EU Measuring Instrument Directive which sets standards of accuracy. This Directive is implemented in Ireland by the Legal Metrology (European Conformity Assessment of Measuring Instruments) Regulations 2007. The Legal Metrology Service of the National Standards Authority of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for regulating and supervising weights and measures, including meters, in Ireland. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea. </p><p>  The UK published its draft Energy National Policy Statement in November 2009, which signalled its intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable. This was subsequently revised in October 2010 when the number of planned stations was reduced to eight, following the dropping of two sites originally proposed for Cumbria, near the existing Sellafield facility. </p><p>  Ireland has been actively involved in the consultation process on the new build programme. Since the original announcement in 2009, Ireland has written twice at Ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea. The key issues of concern include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. This engagement at Ministerial level has been supported and informed by a continuing dialogue at official level where Irish officials engage, and raise concerns where appropriate, with UK counterparts directly engaged in the development and implementation of the plans. </p><p>  Ireland was notified in early 2012 of the proposed development at Hinkley Point. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), in accordance with its statutory advisory role to the Government, has been requested to complete an assessment of the potential radiological impacts on Ireland from the programme of new nuclear power plants in the UK, including the plant at Hinkley Point. This assessment will consider both routine operations and a range of postulated accident scenarios at the plants. The Report is being finalised and will be submitted to me shortly. I expect to publish the Report and the RPII will then provide briefings for interested parties. </p><p>  Under the EURATOM Treaty the UK was required to satisfy the European Commission that the development at Hinkley Point would not be liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. In that context, a Commission opinion, issued in February 2012, considered that under normal operating conditions, the discharges of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents are not likely to cause an exposure of the population in another Member State that is significant from the point of view of health. </p></reply>

Prior to this the LEADER elements were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national exchequer sources. The 2011 agreement reduced the national exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to approximately &euro;314m on the basis of the Programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013. </p><p>  Axes 3 and 4 of the RDP has already allocated significant resources to rural communities all over Ireland with just over &euro;200 million allocated to date. However, given the levels of spending by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) from 2009 to date, it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013, at which time the co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond that date. As a consequence of this the overall Programme requirement will change. In the context of these changes to the co-funding rate the original project allocations given to each LDC contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP require readjustment. </p><p>  An exercise is currently being carried out to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures in order to rebalance the programme in as equitable a way as possible. It will not be possible to be definitive regarding the remaining funding available for project commitments until such time as this rebalancing exercise has been satisfactorily completed. </p><p>  I expect this exercise to be completed shortly and following this my Department will be in contact with all LDC s regarding allocations and any specific projects which are awaiting Departmental approval. </p></reply>

The Code of Practice for the Management of Fire Safety in Places of Assembly, published by my Department, provides guidance to persons in control of places of assembly as to the measures necessary to discharge the se statutory obligations. The Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape), Regulations, 1985 require persons in control of premises to ensure that all escape routes to a place of safety are kept unobstructed and immediately available for use.</p><p>Section 22 of the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003 empowers fire authorities to inspect any land or building, including leisure complexes, for the purpose of the Act.

The SDZ Draft Planning Scheme will remain on public display until 10 May 2013, until which time interested parties, including the Docklands communities, may make written submissions or observations.

The Government has indicated an intention to move from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including, a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and, a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p><p>  The Local Property Tax is not intended to reflect the degree to which an individual household, or set of households, receive services. Rather, Local Property Tax funding will reinforce the link between decisions on service provision as a whole in a local authority and the funding of those services.</p><p>  Society as a whole benefit s from the services local authorities provide, even when such benefits accrue at a community level, such as from the positive contribution libraries make to society as a whole, or the benefit of having access to services a household may need in the future, such as fire and emergency.</p><p>  I anticipate that local financial reporting will ensure taxpayers and their elected representatives are kept abreast of the uses to which Local Property Tax revenue is applied in any given local authority. I do not propose to impose a central mechanism for such reporting; a function of the Local Property Tax is to enhance local accountability, not to increase Central Government demands on local authorities.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection and appointment of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law. Accordingly, there is no information in my Department about the staff employed at the recent Meath East bye-election. Information regarding the remuneration of those employed at the bye-election is set out in the Returning Officer&rsquo;s Charges Order made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The guidance issued by my Department to returning officers in advance of each election and referendum. including the Meath East bye-election, emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people. Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed. </p><p>  In addition, at my request, my Department wrote to each Returning Officer on 4 October 2012, advising that, wherever practicable, the opportunity should be taken to employ unemployed persons at polling stations and in carrying out the subsequent counting of votes at elections and referendums so as to provide opportunity for work experience to unemployed persons. I believe that this should apply particularly in relation to the Polling Clerk position, where the responsibilities of the post can be fulfilled under the guidance of the Presiding Officer. </p></reply>

Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received.

However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

The Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge.</p><p>  A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons and in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns.</p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 and local authorities are expected to implement these guidelines appropriately.</p></reply>

This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.

A public information leaflet, A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie.</p><p>  The position in regard to tenants is that landlords are responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. In this regard, the Act prohibits anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing other occupiers of, or visitors to, the dwelling to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only seven days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour. Under Section 15 of the Act, &lsquo;a landlord of a dwelling owes to each person, who could be potentially affected, a duty to enforce the obligations of the tenant under the tenancy&rsquo;.</p><p>  Section 77 of the Act gives a right to refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), subject to certain conditions. The PRTB may furnish, to a person who proposes to make such a complaint, the name and address of the landlord concerned. This again is subject to certain conditions. </p><p>  The PRTB website address is www.prtb.ie, and contact may be made with the PRTB either by telephone at 0818 30 30 37 or by post to Private Residential Tenancies Board, PO Box 47, Clonakilty, County Cork.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector. Real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates and the Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort. Under the Public Safety Initiative for Unfinished Housing Developments my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;3.877 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available to address immediate public safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. To date, a total of &euro;2.515 million has been drawn down by local authorities. It is not considered necessary to allocate any additional funding to this scheme at this time as the funds currently available are adequate to service this initiative. </p><p>  This funding is targeted at those developments where a developer has abandoned the development and serious public safety concerns exist. In circumstances where a developer is still active it is the responsibility of the local authority planning department to pursue the developer for completion of the development in line with the terms of the original planning permission. Similarly, where a developer is inactive but still in place the enforcement of the planning conditions is a matter for the relevant planning authority. </p><p>  Under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility, the facility also exists whereby a repayable advance to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) can facilitate such bodies in the acquisition and, if necessary, completion of housing units which would be made available for social housing purposes. These can include housing units in unfinished housing developments. It is open to interested AHBs to make an application to my Department in this regard.</p></reply>

Initiatives taken have included the introduction into fire service operations of the National Incident Command System in 2007; The Fire Services Ancillary Safety Statement, also from 2007, which developed generic risk assessment processes for fire services, and more recently the Fire Service Standard Operational Guidance (SOGs), which developed specific situational risk assessments for fire services activities. </p><p>  Also, as part of the national policies for the future direction of fire services set out in Keeping Communities Safe (KCS), which was published in February 2013. a Fire Services Safety Management System (SMS) support document is being developed as <i>part</i> of the KCS implementation process to ensure that occupational health and safety in fire services is fully aligned with recently adopted local government SMS policy. </p><p>  Specific legislation dealing with assaults on. or threats to, emergency workers in front line positions is contained in section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended by section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006). Section 19 provides that any person who assaults a person providing medical services at or in a hospital. or a peace officer acting in the execution of their duty. is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both. A peace officer refers to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a prison officer, a member of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel or a member of the defence forces.  The offences in section 19 were extended to hospital, ambulance and fire brigade personnel by means of section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in order to address the problem of assaults and obstruction of personnel engaged in providing emergency services.</p><p>  In addition to the special offences under section 19 of the 1994 Act. the general criminal law applies. For example, in the case of an assault causing serious harm to an emergency worker, the offender may be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. </p><p>  Personal safety devices in the nature of mace or pepper spray are subject to the Firearms Act 1925 to 2009. Under section 1 of the Firearms Act 1925. as amended by section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, the definition of &quot;firearm&quot; includes a &quot;prohibited weapon&quot; which refers <i>inter alia</i> to &quot;any weapon of whatever description designed for the discharge of any noxious liquid, noxious gas or other noxious thing&quot;. Under section 2 of the 1925 Act, it is an offence to possess, use, or carry a firearm unless it is authorised by a firearms certificate. While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defences Forces are generally considered exempt from the Firearms Acts (with regard to the licensing for their use and import) there is no such corresponding provision for fire brigade, ambulance or medical personnel. The issue of firearms certificates is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

Among the measures included in the policy is the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to report to Government with options to minimise the impact of waste charges on low income households. The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its first report to Government on 11 December 2012.  Government considered the report and the working group is to continue to examine the design and implementation of measures to address the issue and will provide a further report to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>  Another measure of the Government&#8217;s waste policy is the revision of the current regulatory regime, to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>. that waste collection providers have Customer Charters in place. The Customer Charters will be required clearly to set out information for customers in relation to issues such as charging structures, procedures for dealing with customers who may fall into arrears and arrangements for switching from one waste collector to another.  I wrote to the waste management industry in September and October, 2012 in relation to the development of such charters and I understand that a number of waste collection providers have already put in place a Customer Charter ahead of the development of the new regulatory regime. I further understand that a number of waste collection operators have notified former local authority customers of the offers and discounts available to those previously in receipt of a local authority waste collection waiver.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;332.7m in 2012, with an anticipated outturn of some &euro;299m for 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate, the projected outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units. Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year. However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p></reply>

The objective of these regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.</p><p>  Local authorities are the competent authorities for implementation of the GAP regulations and are also empowered under the Water Pollution Acts 1977 to 2007 to prevent or control pollution of waters. In fulfilling these roles, local authorities may request information, for example in the form of effluent management plans, to ensure the compliance of on-farm development proposals with the legislation.</p><p>  It is incumbent on local authorities to ensure that all proposed agricultural developments comply with the Water Pollution Acts and the GAP regulations. There is no requirement under the Planning and Development Act 2000 or the associated Regulations in relation to the submission of an effluent management plan as part of a planning application. Planning authorities may, however, when considering a planning application seek such further information as they consider necessary to decide the application in question.</p><p>  My Department has no role in this process and does not compile or keep data on the information sought by local authorities for this purpose. The principal role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to check compliance of farms with the GAP regulations.</p><p>  Consistency of approach to the implementation of the GAP regulations is overseen by a working group consisting of representatives from my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, local authorities and the EPA.</p></reply>

A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Limerick County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas. These were subsequently appraised in my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.</p><p>  Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme. No proposal s for the Bruff and Pallasgreen Sewerage Scheme s w ere   received from Limerick County Council in response to the review process.</p></reply>

Paragraph (2) of the Regulation clarifies that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. This provision is reasonable in most cases.</p><p>  I acknowledge, however, that situations relating to household members who have separated may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations. <b></b>Persons who are forced to leave their homes due to domestic violence may however be placed in accommodation arranged by local authorities without having to be entered on the waiting list.

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</p><p>  The regulations have effect in their entirety for all rented properties being let for the first time from 1 February 2009. However, in some cases Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the regulations may have required significant refurbishment works for existing tenancies and, as such, a four year phasing-in period was afforded to these properties to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out. On 1 February 20 13, Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the regulations came into effect for all existing residential rented accommodation. This will result in the phasing-out of the traditional &quot;bed-sit&quot; where sanitary facilities are shared between different rental units.</p><p>  It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the <i>Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement</i> published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which make a range of recommendations on relevant issues, including targeting inspection activities.</p><p>  Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened, updated legislative and regulatory framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations under the regulations, and fines for continuing non-compliance with the regulations have also been significantly increased. While I expect that the large majority of landlords will comply with local authorities&#8217; directions in the area of standards, the legal powers available to local authorities are an important aspect of enforcement and I encourage local authorities to use them where landlords have failed to comply with directions.</p><p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 sets out a range of rights and responsibilities for tenants and landlords in the private rented residential sector. Section 12 of the Act specifies the obligations of landlords including that the dwelling be in compliance with the standards prescribed under Section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. A tenant may take a case against a landlord to the PRTB for, <i>inter alia</i>, a breach of this obligation.</p><p>My Department engaged in an extensive consultation process during the development of the regulations involving landlord and tenant representative groups, local authorities and the social and voluntary pillar under the social partnership agreement <i>Towards 2016</i>. In addition, a period of public consultation was carried out during July and August 2008 inviting submissions from members of the general public on the proposed new standards regulations. Following the making of the regulations in December 2008 copies were provided to various sectoral interests, including landlord and tenant representative bodies, and the coming into effect of the regulations was advertised in the national print media. In 2012 my Department placed further advertisements in the national print media and on my Department's website  regarding the coming into full effect of Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the regulations. My Department also engaged with landlord and tenant representative groups to encourage them to advertise the 1 February 2013 deadline within their respective sectors.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of homelessness, statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities. These authorities implement homelessness action plans which incorporate prevention strategies to prevent homelessness. I recently published a <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>   which places an emphasis on a housing-led approach as the primary response to homelessness and places prevention at the forefront of the delivery of services.</p><p>  My Department continues to engage with the local authorities on the implementation of the regulations and will keep the impacts arising under review. As they only came into full effect earlier this year it will take some time to identify and assess those impacts. In particular, I recognise that close regard must be had to supporting vulnerable tenants in making the transition from sub-standard accommodation to accommodation that meets the standards set out in the regulations. My Department meets regularly with the Department of Social Protection on a range of issues; to date, however, it has not been notified of any impact on demand for rent supplement due to the full implementation of the regulations.</p><p>  My Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing statistics that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy, and those data are available on my Department&#8217;s website . Data on local authorities&#8217; minimum standards inspection activities are included within that range and they show that, in general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity over the last number of years. Data not collected on the number of housing units upgraded as a result of the regulations.</p><p>  I have not set any target date for the completion of all inspections as I am of the view that local authorities should maintain a steady programme of inspection activity every year. I am confident that strategically planned inspection and enforcement activity by local authorities will continue to improve the quality of the stock in the rented sector and I urge all landlords to ensure that their dwellings are in compliance with the regulations.</p></reply>

Section 35 of the 1996 Act provides that a local authority may make bye-laws requiring a holder of household waste to present such waste, specifying sorting measures, quantities, location, times and other relevant matters.  As such, it is a role of the relevant local authority to regulate the presentation of waste for collection, in alignment with the national, regional and local policy framework, for all categories of dwelling.</p><p>  Penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment.  The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.</p><p>  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial.  Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place, my Department is preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of on-the-spot fines for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping.  I expect to be in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval shortly.  As part of a revision of regulation of household waste collection, all householders will be required to demonstrate that they are availing of an authorised waste collection service or are otherwise managing their waste in an environmentally acceptable manner.</p><p>  Under article 12 of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, a dwelling let for rent must generally have access to suitable and adequate pest and vermin proof refuse storage facilities.  Where there is more than one dwelling in a building, these facilities may be provided individually for each dwelling or a communal facility can be provided for the building provided it is suitable and adequate to collect and store the refuse in an appropriate manner between collections.

The previous provision remains in the Planning and Development Act 2000, under which an extension of permission is automatically given on application in a case where substantial works have been carried out within the original duration (subject only to the condition that an application complying with the relevant Regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period).</p><p>  I consider that the amendment made in 2010 strikes an appropriate balance and that in cases where substantial works have not been carried out the duration of permission should not be extended in respect of developments for which the planning authority would now refuse permission in respect of current applications.  I have no plans to further amend the Act in this regard.</p></reply>

However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in possession before allowing them to board aircraft.  As such, this is not an immigration requirement.  Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State.  Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks.  It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation.  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person.</p><p>  In circumstances like the one outlined by the Deputy, where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who is continually travelling between ports within the CTA, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA and as such is entitled to benefit from its immigration arrangements.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that border entry practices in the UK for CTA arrivals vary considerably from place to place.  For example, in some UK regional airports, police officers on occasion seek identity documents for passengers from this jurisdiction.  In other cases, evidence of having boarded an aircraft in Ireland is sought, whereas, at Heathrow Terminal 1 there is a dedicated CTA channel for arriving passengers which the obviates the need for the production of identity documents.  However, it remains at the discretion of the UK immigration authorities to request passengers to produce such documentation as required.</p><p>  In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and in the UK immigration authorities have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area. Movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse.  The cooperation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality.</p><p>  It should be noted that in fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions. In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation &amp; Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, may require any person on an aerodrome to: (i) give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his / her identity; (ii) state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome; (iii) account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession.</p></reply>

The relevant sections are included beneath for the Deputy's information.</p><p><i>At the outset I think it important to state that it is the long-standing policy and practice for the Department not to comment in detail on the outcome of cases which have been before the Courts.  This policy applies equally to cases in which the Department&#8217;s interpretation of the law have been upheld in the Courts as it does to cases where the Courts have found against such interpretation.  There are sound and well grounded reasons for this approach; to comment in detail on specific cases would carry the risk that the Department would be accused of interfering with the doctrine of the separation of powers between the State and the Courts.  This doctrine which is enshrined in the Constitution is of course a fundamental cornerstone of our system of justice and its interface with the executive.</i></p><p><i>However, I would point out that my Department in its approach to legal challenges acts on foot of the legal advice available to it from the State's law officers.  In considering its approach, as well as considering the specific facts of each individual case, it must have regard to the wider implications of any such challenges and as such is required to act in order to maintain the integrity of the State's immigration policies and procedures.  My Department in dealing with all such cases acts in good faith, with integrity, in accordance with the law as it understands it to be at that time, and in accordance with the legal advice available to it.</i></p></reply>

As the Deputies may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary. </p><p>  The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The committee has identified, as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments.  It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.  This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is in the process of assisting it to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p><p>  One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of capacity legislation.  Drafting of the Bill is being finalised with a view to meeting the commitment in the Government Legislation Programme which indicates that the Bill is expected to be published in the current session.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Work is being completed to properly align the provisions of the Bill with the principles contained in the UN Convention on supporting people with impaired capacity in making decisions and exercising their basic rights.  I envisage that the revised title of the Bill, The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill, will reflect this approach. </p></reply>

It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.

Through these instruments, a network of Central Authorities have been established in Contracting States to facilitate applications for the return of these children.  The Central Authority for International Child Abduction is part of my Department and can be contacted for assistance at 01/4790200 or by e-mail internationalchildabduction@justice.ie.</p><p>  Mediation remains the best way for estranged parents and spouses to resolve their differences and reach lasting agreements that work in the best interests of the children involved.  Following a Government Decision, on 1 November 2011, the Family Mediation Service became part of the Legal Aid Board.  This service can help families resolve their differences before they escalate into a possible child abduction situation or the family has to resort to the Courts to solve their differences.  I would encourage any family in such a situation to access these services and to do so as soon as possible.</p><p>  It is my intention to bring forward, later this year, a Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings in civil and commercial cases, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that a wide range of statutes provide for the gathering of evidence by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whatever forms such evidence may take.  For example, under section 48 of the Theft and Fraud Offences Act 2001, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acting under the authority of a search warrant issued by a District Court Judge may operate any computer at the place which is being searched or cause any such computer to be operated by a person accompanying the member for that purpose, and require any person at that place who appears to the member to have lawful access to the information in any such computer to cooperate with the member in question.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the 2011 Communications (Retention of Data) Act  provides for access to traffic data, location data and subscriber data, but not content data.  An application for such data may be made by a member of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na not below the rank of Chief Superintendent to a service provider where the data concerned is required in the context of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of a serious offence, the security of the State or the saving of human life.</p><p>  With regard to interceptions, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993 provides for the interception of telecommunications messages.  Under Section 2 of the Act, the Minister may give authorisation for such interceptions and only in the interests of the security of the State or for the purpose of criminal investigation.  In terms of oversight, both the 1993 and 2011 Acts provide for the appointment of a High Court Judge to carry out an annual review of their operation and the relevant reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual basis.  In addition, the Acts provide for a procedure whereby a member of the public who believes their communications have been intercepted or that their personal data has been accessed (whichever the case may be) may make a complaint to a &quot;Complaints Referee&quot;.  The Acts provides that the Complaints Referee must be a judge of the Circuit or District Courts or a practicing barrister or solicitor of at least ten years standing.</p></reply>

RIA itself has no function in determining whether someone should stay or not in its accommodation, except in the context of rare instances of serious and repeated misbehaviour.  Its function is to provide accommodation and ancillary services to those who have sought international protection and who otherwise have no means of supporting themselves.</p><p>In relation to the statistics below, the overall length of time taken to process cases to their finality is determined not just by the length of time taken to process the cases by the independent refugee determination bodies and by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and but also by the length of time taken by the applicant/their legal representative to respond to requests for information, etc.  In some cases applicants choose to change their legal representative and understandably it takes some time for the new representative to become familiar with the case.  In many cases the applicant will not agree with the decisions reached and will continue to use every avenue open to them including referral to the Courts in that regard.  This obviously impacts on the time the same applicants spend in the process and also in the Direct Provision system.  While not suggesting that applicants are not entitled to the protection of the courts and to due process, a consequence of these actions is to extend the length of time the applicant spends in the Direct Provision system.</p><p>INIS has no desire to have applicants remain in the system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  However, ultimately a balance has to be struck between maintaining the integrity of the State&rsquo;s protection and immigration systems and the case put forward by the individual applicant all of which must be considered within the legal requirements and obligations.  In the first instance requirements are set-down in primary and secondary legislation and these requirements are constantly evolving taking into account interpretation of the law by the Courts at both national and EU level.</p><p>As I have stated previously, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.</p><p>Insofar as the statistics below are concerned, it is important to note that protection applicants are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change.  In relation to the tables below, up and including 2010 duration of stay was calculated by reference to the time that had elapsed since residents first made an application for international protection.  It does not necessarily mean that those persons have lived in RIA accommodation for all of that period.  Arising from the creation of a new database which allows for more detailed information, since 2011 duration of stay is calculated from the date of the latest entry into RIA accommodation, rather than from the initial protection application.  It does not include past time spent by residents who left the system for a period and subsequently sought and were granted re-access to the system.</p><p>  <b>Duration of Stay in RIA Accommodation</b><table><tr><th>Months in RIA Accom.</th><th><div>0&gt;6    </div></th><th><div>6&gt;12</div></th><th><div>12&gt;18</div></th><th><div>18&gt;24</div></th><th><div>24&gt;36</div></th><th><div>36+</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td>No. Persons End 2010</td><td><div>522        8.7%</div></td><td><div>449      7.5%</div></td><td><div>476         7.9%</div></td><td><div>529           8.8%</div></td><td><div>1258         20.9%</div></td><td><div>2778       46.2%</div></td><td>6012</td></tr><tr><td>No. Persons End 2011</td><td><div>436        8.3%</div></td><td><div>282      5.4%</div></td><td><div>338         6.4%</div></td><td><div>343           6.5%</div></td><td><div>802           15.3%</div></td><td><div>3040       58.0%</div></td><td>5241</td></tr><tr><td>No. Persons 11 April 2013</td><td><div>400        8.4%</div></td><td><div>453      9.6%</div></td><td><div>333         7.0%</div></td><td><div>218           4.6%</div></td><td><div>481           10.2%</div></td><td><div>2850       60.3%</div></td><td>4735</td></tr></table></p><p>A further breakdown of those staying in RIA accommodation longer than three years cannot be provided retrospectively but is available as and from a current date - in this case 11 April, 2013.</p><p><b>More Detailed Breakdown of Duration of Stay - 11 April, 2013</b></p><p>No. of Months spent by persons in RIA accommodation centres since latest entry into Direct Provision</p><p><table><tr><th><div>0 &gt; 6</div></th><th><div>400 </div></th><th><div>8.4%</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>6 &gt; 12</div></td><td><div>453 </div></td><td><div>9.6%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>12 &gt; 18</div></td><td><div>333 </div></td><td><div>7.0%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>18 &gt; 24</div></td><td><div>218 </div></td><td><div>4.6%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>24 &gt; 36 </div></td><td><div>481 </div></td><td><div>10.2%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>36 &gt; 48</div></td><td><div>557 </div></td><td><div>11.8%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>48 &gt; 60</div></td><td><div>724 </div></td><td><div>15.3%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>60 &gt; 72</div></td><td><div>621 </div></td><td><div>13.1%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>72 &gt; 84</div></td><td><div>475 </div></td><td><div>10.0%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>84+</div></td><td><div>473 </div></td><td><div>10.0%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>4735 persons</div></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In view of these complexities, the fact that these are new cases and the necessity to consider each case on its own individual merits, it is not possible to give an average processing time for such applications.

RIA is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection is being processed.  These questions refer to an anonymous letter of complaint dated 26 March, 2013 signed simply &quot;residents&quot;, in respect of a Dublin asylum accommodation centre under contract to RIA.  The letter related to issues such as food provision and the management style in the centre.  RIA received a copy of this correspondence, which appears to have been also copied to members of the Oireachtas, from the contractor concerned on 2 April, 2013.  Coincidently, RIA had a meeting scheduled with the contractor for 3 April on other matters and the opportunity was taken raise the letter for discussion.  As the correspondence is unsigned, the option for RIA to speak with any specific resident or group of residents does not arise.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the anonymity of the complaint, RIA held an 'Information Clinic' at the centre on Monday 8 April, 2013 in order to ascertain whether the issues raised in the letter had substance.  These clinics provide residents of a centre with an opportunity to speak with RIA staff on a one-to-one basis, without any centre staff or other parties present.  Despite advance notice of the clinic being posted up in the centre since 3 April, only two residents presented to RIA staff.  A further unsigned item of correspondence dated 4 April, 2013, again similarly signed &quot;residents&quot;, was received by RIA on 11 April, 2013.  This document sets out a number of specific issues which the contractor is being asked to address.</p><p>  These documents make very specific demands and are being examined in detail by both RIA and by the centre contractor who will shortly organise a general meeting with residents.  It should be said that some of the demands made, such as seeking the right to have non-residents stay overnight in the centre or having residents decide who the management of the centre shall be, cannot be entertained by RIA.</p><p>  It's worth making the general point that a core aim of RIA is ensuring the maintenance and improvement of standards in centres under contract to it.  Any diminution in standards which comes its attention is treated very seriously by RIA, and proprietors are immediately required to make any changes and improvements deemed necessary.  In this instance, RIA will ensure that any matters arising on foot of its investigations will be addressed without delay.</p><p>  In relation to standards of service, all accommodation providers and other companies engaged by RIA to operate centres are required under a comprehensive Memorandum of Agreement (generically approved by the Office of the Attorney General) to ensure that the centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and other agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, fire safety, general safety and so forth.  The contract also sets out staffing, security and management levels required for each centre.</p><p>  RIA regularly conducts unannounced comprehensive full day and other informal inspections on each of the centres to ensure that the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement are being met.  In addition, the RIA has for the past number of years engaged independent assessors with expertise in the field to conduct inspections on its behalf.  All centres are also open to inspection by Environmental Health Officers.</p><p>  It is the policy of the RIA to conduct at least twice yearly comprehensive inspections on each of the properties used to accommodate asylum seekers.  The independent assessor contracted by the RIA also conducts comprehensive inspections on every centre at least once per year.  These are not financial audits.  RIA has a straightforward commercial contract for the provision of services to asylum seekers.  On the financial side, the contracts are based on a negotiated per person, per day rate for a contracted number of residents over a specified period.  The issue of RIA conducting a financial audit of the income and expenditure of a commercial provider under contract to it does not arise.  For RIA, the inspection process is to ensure that the services it has contracted for are being properly provided; in other words, RIA needs to make sure it is getting what it is paying for.</p><p>  Inspections are always unannounced and the inspection team look at all aspects of the accommodation centre in relation to the proprietors obligations under the Memorandum of Agreement which covers such areas as reception, management and staff cover, menus and facilities being provided, maintenance of the property and fire and safety issues.  As already indicated, information clinics where residents can raise issues on a one-to-one basis with RIA staff are undertaken regularly.  There are 3 such clinics held per centre per year at a minimum.  Moreover, 'bed-audits' are conducted at a selection of centres each year whereby a full detailed snapshot of service provision is taken to ensure that House Rules, contractual obligations, health and safety and other requirements have been addressed.  In relation to complaints and associated appeals by residents in respect of the services provided at their centre, the mechanisms for dealing with such complaints are clearly set out in the House Rules &amp; Procedures document given at all residents in RIA accommodation.  This document is available in 12 languages (including English) and can be found on the RIA website www.ria.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, has greatly strengthened the law in this area and further legislation to extend the categories of exploitation provided for in the 2008 Act has been approved by Government and will be brought before the Oireachtas in the near future.</p><p>  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  In addition to the dedicated Unit in my Department there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue: the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau; the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive, and a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board.</p><p>  Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff in the New Communities and Asylum Seekers Unit in the Department of Social Protection facilitates victims moving into mainstream social services.  There are also a wide range of training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with Non-Governmental Organisations, International Organisations and State Agencies.</p><p>  I am satisfied with the resources committed to the fight against the trafficking of human beings into and within Ireland.  This year, and for the past few years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in its Annual Policing Plan, has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities with an increased focus given to prevention and detection of human trafficking.  The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking, these include: accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education.  The Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the HSE develops individual Care Plans for persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking.  These Care Plans include a range of issues including medical health, GP referral, counselling, psychological care, sexual health, material assistance, accommodation, training needs, education, etc.  My Department also provides funding to two organisations, Ruhama and the Migrant&#8217;s Rights Centre of Ireland, who work with victims of human trafficking.</p><p>  The Government&#8217;s approach to the issue of Human Trafficking is set out in the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons which set out 144 Actions to be undertaken to address this issue.  A copy of the National Action Plan and a recently published Review of the Plan are available on the dedicated Anti-Trafficking site blueblindfold.ie.  A new National Action Plan to cover the period from 2013 to 2016 is currently being drafted.  In-depth reviews of Ireland&#8217;s response to human trafficking were carried out in 2012 by the <i>Special Representative and Coordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)</i> who visited in February and the <i>Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA)</i> who carried out a week long country visit in November.  The Report of the OSCE Special Representative was published recently and the detailed Report of <i>GRETA</i> will be available in the first half of 2013.  I have agreed that it is prudent that we await their views on our progress before we proceed to publish the new National Action Plan.  The views of these international organisations, the developments at EU level, along with consultations with other state agencies and civil society will significantly inform the direction and content of the new National Action Plan.</p></reply>

There are approximately 4,800 persons in these 35 centres, about a third of whom are children under the age of 18.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.  This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i>  I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens.</p><p>  I will concentrate here on the issue of child protection which was the focus of the article.  RIA takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously. RIA has had a child protection policy, based on the HSE's Children First Policy, in place since 2006.  There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  Moreover, all staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's child protection policy, a copy of which is available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie.  This is in furtherance of RIA's policy which has as its principal aim the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in its centres.</p><p>  More generally, the rights of residents in RIA centres are, put simply, protected in three ways: (a) RIA's House Rules and Procedures which set out the type and standard of service that an asylum seeker should expect whilst residing in direct provision accommodation.  The Rules set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and on residents and, in the event that these aren't being met, a complaints procedure to be invoked by either party.  This complaints system is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for &#8216;internal complaints systems&#8217;.  (b) Over and above the House Rules themselves, the interests of asylum seekers are protected through regular 'clinics' in centres where residents can speak directly to RIA headquarters staff one-on-one without local centre management being present.  (c) Inspections take place in centres, by RIA staff and by an independent company contract to RIA, to ensure that centres are adhering to their contractual obligations.  In the coming few months RIA will begin to publish on its website completed inspection reports on each of the centres under contract to it.  It cannot be emphasised enough that all inspections are unannounced.  Inspections are not to be confused with ordinary day-to-day visits to centres by RIA staff in connection with operational, health or educational matters where management would know of their arrival in advance.  Moreover, issues of concern are also brought to the attention of RIA by representatives of statutory or voluntary agencies working with asylum seekers, as was the case here.  In no circumstance does a transfer take place because of a complaint made.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of space, including the sharing of bedrooms and toilet facilities which is raised in the article, there are a number of things to be said.  Firstly, in sourcing accommodation RIA must ensure that the basic legal conditions, in terms of capacity and toilet and bathroom facilities, are met.  Secondly, in relation to room sharing, where it comes to RIA's attention that accommodation is not suitable for a family where, for example, its size has increased, alternative accommodation in another centre is offered.  In some cases, this offer is not accepted and families prefer to stay in a centre.  Thirdly, in relation to families having to share bathrooms, a majority of families living in the system have sole access to their own bathroom and toilet facilities.  Whilst the nature of Direct Provision is such that en suite facilities are not guaranteed, RIA will continue to seek over time to increase the percentage of families having access to non-shared bathroom/toilet facilities.</p><p>  In relation to 'de-skilling', also mentioned in the article, the existing statutory position in Ireland provides that an asylum seeker shall not seek or enter employment.  This prohibition is retained in the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which I intend to republish later this year.  Extending the right to work to asylum seekers would almost certainly have a profoundly negative impact on application numbers, as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so.</p><p>  In relation to the broader asylum issue, I acknowledges that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  No specific reference is made in the Programme for Government to the Direct Provision system.  But that system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process and in the Programme there is a specific commitment to introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.</p></reply>

The Authority is however fully aware of the difficulties faced by the industry at this time and continues to seek ways of easing the burden of regulation while at the same time meeting its statutory obligations.

Any change in such fees however requires the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument and my Department is in regular contact with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in this regard and has asked that it be given priority.

Section 12 of the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 provides that the High Court, on application from the donor, attorney or an interested party, may give direction with respect to, among other things, a personal care decision made or to be made by an attorney. Section 12 also gives the High Court the power to cancel the registration of an enduring power of attorney.</p><p>  The Assisted Decision-Making Bill, which will be published in the near future, will subsume and re-enact the enduring power provisions of the 1996 Act to bring them into line with the general principles of the Bill. The Bill will propose the establishment of an Office of the Public Guardian which, amongst its other functions, will have responsibilities in registering enduring powers and in supervising attorneys.</p><p>  In relation to health care decisions, legislative provisions for advance healthcare directives will be incorporated into the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill. These provisions are being drafted by officials in the Department of Health. The purpose of the advance healthcare directive provisions is to promote individual autonomy and to ensure that people receive treatment that is respectful of their will and preferences. As part of this process, it is envisaged that there will be two mechanisms whereby an adult with capacity can nominate, a legal representative who would be involved in the healthcare decision-making process on that individual&rsquo;s behalf should s/he subsequently lose capacity, namely the enduring power of attorney or by nominating a patient-designated healthcare representative (usually a relative or close friend trusted by the individual) in his/her advance healthcare directive. The proposed purpose of the patient-designated healthcare representative system is to provide a more facilitative mechanism which does not require the involvement of the courts or other statutory bodies, through which an individual can appoint a legal agent for healthcare decision-making. </p></reply>

Under article 41.3.2.i of the Constitution the spouses must have lived apart for four of the previous five years before divorce proceedings may be initiated. In view of the length of this period, it is essential that spouses have access to the courts if they are unable to reach satisfactory separation terms between themselves, with or without the assistance of mediation and / or legal advice. Some forms of ancillary relief on marital breakdown are also not available other than in proceedings under the Family Law Act 1995, or of course under the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996. </p><p>  In addition to these practical requirements to provide for appropriate settlement for spouses in advance of divorce, it is also important to recognise that there are spouses whose marriages have broken down irretrievably but who may not wish, for whatever reason, to divorce. Where this occurs but the spouses are not otherwise in agreement over the terms of separation, judicial separation under the 1989 Act and the ancillary relief provisions of the 1995 Act give them suitable access to the courts to resolve their disputes and make appropriate financial and other orders. </p></reply>

They give a motorist the opportunity to acknowledge the offence, pay the fixed charge and, where the offence is a penalty point offence, incur the appropriate penalty points.  While the issuing of a Fixed Charge Notice does not constitute commencement of legal proceedings, it normally leads to a prosecution if the fixed charge is not paid. </p><p>  There can be circumstances, however, where the Fixed Charge Notice may be cancelled, in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines issued by the DPP.  The basis for this is the long-established non-statutory principle of prosecutorial discretion, whereby there is no obligation to prosecute in any given case.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.    The procedures provide authority to District Officers (who are Superintendents), or Inspectors Acting as District Officers, and an Inspector in the Fixed Charge Processing Office, to cancel Fixed Charge Notices. </p><p>District Officers or Acting District Officers therefore have discretion to authorise cancellation in appropriate circumstances of Fixed Charge Notices.  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply in relation to emergency vehicles or the wearing of seatbelts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.  Access to cancel a fixed charge notice through 'Pulse' is restricted to users with the rank of Inspector or higher.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, documentation containing allegations concerning the enforcement of road traffic legislation was forwarded by my Department to the Garda Commissioner.

RIA is currently providing accommodation for 4,751 persons in 35 centres.</p><p>  Section 5 (1) (e) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980 and section 11(1) (e) of the Ombudsman for Children's Act, 2002 provide that either Ombudsman shall not investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum.  Whilst there are no plans to change those legislative provisions to give either Office the power to investigate asylum related matters, INIS, including RIA, has administrative arrangements in place with both Offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to its attention.  At all events, it should be noted that it was not intended that either Ombudsman would serve as a first instance appellant authority in relation to day to day administrative complaints mechanisms.  It is a requirement that a person who wishes to appeal to the Ombudsman must first try to solve the problem with the public body concerned using formal local appeals mechanism.  </p><p>  In relation to the broader issue of complaints by residents of direct provision centres under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, these are dealt with in accordance with the revised RIA House Rules and Procedures which are available in several languages on the RIA website at   A copy of these rules and procedures is provided to all asylum seekers on arrival at their accommodation centre. </p><p>  Experience has shown that, given the nature and the number of such complaints, they are best resolved by informal discussion between residents and management at a local level.  Where more serious complaints arise, residents have the right to lodge a formal written complaint with centre management and, if the issue remains unresolved, residents can take the complaint to RIA. It also allows for direct referral to RIA in certain circumstances.  It is important to note that if a complaint is made in respect of a decision made by a particular RIA official, the appeal is not dealt with by that official. The complaints system contained in these House Rules is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for internal complaints systems.  </p><p>  It is important to emphasise that the rules specifically state that (a) residents should not be afraid to complain when they need to and (b) making a complaint will not affect how other official agencies consider their claims to remain in the State i.e. on asylum, subsidiary protection or general leave to remain grounds.</p><p>  To give the Deputy a broader picture on these issues, I should point out that RIA already publishes on its website aggregated yearly statistics on formal written complaints made under these Rules and will also do so in its 2012 Annual Report which will be published shortly. Moreover, in an effort to provide greater transparency, in the next few months RIA will begin publishing completed inspection reports carried out in respect of each of the centres under contract to it.  The Deputy might also wish to note that I have answered other D&aacute;il Questions today (specifically 16483/13) which provide greater detail on the position of children in the Direct Provision system.</p></reply>

Currently contractors operating in the Cash-in-Transit, Door Supervisor, Security Guarding and Installer of Security Equipment sectors need a licence while individuals working in the Door Supervisor and Security Guarding sectors must be licensed.</p><p>  Consequently where a sole trader provides a security service as a contractor in the Door Supervisor or Security Guarding sectors but also performs the security guarding/door supervisor duties on the ground (i.e as an individual) both licences are then required.  The reason this is necessary is because such a sole trader must meet  the same set of standards as any other contractor while at the same time having the required qualifications to perform those duties as any individual.</p></reply>

This allocation of resources and the assessment of policing needs in particular areas are constantly monitored in the context of crime trends and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level.

Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances. The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet. As a consequence it is not practicable to provide a breakdown of Garda vehicles by individual station.</p><p>  However, I am informed that on 11 April 2013 there were 30 Garda vehicles allocated to the Coolock District, which includes Swords Garda Station.  The Deputy will be aware that I made an additional &euro;3 million available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year enabling the Commissioner to procure a further 171 Garda vehicles.  This brought total investment in the Garda fleet in 2012 to &euro;4 million and resulted in a total of 213 new vehicles being procured during the year. In addition, a further allocation of &euro;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2013.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to provide an effective and efficient policing service.</p></reply>

Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. One such condition is that the applicant intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation.</p><p>  As the persons referred to by the Deputy stated on their application forms that they did not intend to reside in the State after naturalisation, it was considered that they did not comply with this condition. Consequently, the applications were deemed ineligible.  Further applications were submitted by the persons referred to in April 2012.  As the required application fees were not included with the application forms, they were returned in their entirety to the applicants.  To date no new applications have been received from any of the persons referred to.</p><p>  There is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation for the third person referred to in the Deputy's question.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This mainstreaming approach to disability matters encourages equity of access to services provided by all Government Departments and their agencies for people with disabilities.  I can assure the Deputy that all the State agencies under my Department's remit are fully committed to meeting their obligations under the Disability Act 2005.</p><p>  Specifically agencies under the aegis of my Department are committed to accommodating the needs of all citizens in accessing public buildings and facilities.  This includes the provision of facilities for persons with a disability or special needs.  The Deputy will appreciate that the architectural and design features of many public buildings present considerable challenges in this regard as do the present circumstances regarding availability of resources.  All new refurbishment projects include disabled access to public buildings.  An activity (6.4) of the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence undertakes to identify and promote suitable state service responses in relation to domestic and sexual violence for vulnerable or high-risk groups.  People with a disability are recognised as such a group.  Activity 7.1 of the strategy undertakes to promote and develop practices and protocols on inter-agency referrals and coordination.  Under these activities the National Disability Authority are engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with the Courts Service in relation to developing proposals to improve the response of both organisations in interacting with people with disabilities in accessing the justice system.  Contact between the National Disability Authority and the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuing with the advice and guidance of the National Steering Committee on Violence against Women.</p><p>  The enactment of Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) legislation is also an important step forward in ensuring people with disabilities are supported where necessary to enable them to make important legal decisions, removing barriers that may exist at present in this area. Drafting of the Bill is being finalised with a view to meeting the commitment in the Government Legislation Programme which indicates that the Bill is expected to be published in the current session. The Bill will be in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which has as one of its principles supporting people with impaired capacity in making decisions and exercising their basic rights.  Work is being completed to properly align the provisions of the Bill with the principles contained in the Convention.</p><p>  The National Disability Strategy (NDS) is the main mechanism through which people with disabilities are supported to live full and independent lives.  The various actions and measures contained in the Strategy help to remove any barriers and to allow those with a disability to access mainstream services on an equal basis with others.  I established the NDS Implementation Group last year which I chair.  Presently this group is in the final stages of developing an Implementation Plan for the Strategy.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.   However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.</p><p>  In order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda Vetting, standard processing procedures are such that applications are processed in chronological order, from the date of receipt at the Central Vetting Unit.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.  In the context of the applications referred to in the Deputy's question, I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not possible to check the status of any applications received in respect of the participants referred to in the absence of details such as the names of the participants and dates of birth.

The allocation of Garda personnel is determined through a process of ongoing analysis of existing and emerging crime trends and other policing demands, at both District and Divisional level.  This process enables Garda management to continually develop and refine their operational response, including appropriate patrolling regimes, to ensure that optimum use is made of available Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The deployment of Garda vehicles is, equally, a matter for the Commissioner.  In turn, at Garda Divisional level, the allocation of Garda vehicles is undertaken by the Chief Superintendent who may make and revise arrangements for the deployment of vehicles throughout the Division in response to policing demands. This flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I made an additional &#8364;3 million available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year enabling the Commissioner to procure a further 171 Garda vehicles.  This brought total investment in the Garda fleet in 2012 to &#8364;4 million and resulted in a total of 213 new vehicles being procured during the year.   In addition, a further allocation of &#8364;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2013.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to provide an effective and efficient policing service.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the roll out of the most recently purchased vehicles has been completed and they are satisfied that the current patrolling arrangements in place meet their operational policing requirements.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

The figures for 2011 are 2,275 and 90 respectively.  The figures for 2012 will be contained in the Ombudsman Commission's annual report for that year which is expected to be published shortly.  Complaints investigated by the Ombudsman Commission may involve alleged offences or, alternatively, allege misconduct by a Garda member which does not involve an offence.  The Ombudsman Commission must conduct the investigation itself if the matter complained of involves a potential criminal offence.  Where the complaint does not relate to an offence, the Ombudsman Commission is empowered to devolve the investigation to the Garda&iacute; and the Ombudsman Commission may supervise such investigations.  Thus, the time taken by the Ombudsman Commission to initiate and complete investigations can vary widely depending on the particular aspects of each individual investigation being carried out.  Accordingly, it is not possible to give any meaningful average length of time for concluding an investigation initiated by the Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>  Section 110 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides that a person who, in relation to a complaint or investigation, provides to the Ombudsman Commission information that the person knows to be false or misleading is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.  Prosecutions for this offence must be instituted by, or with the consent of, the DPP on referral of the matter to the DPP by the Ombudsman Commission.  Since commencement of operations the Ombudsman Commission has referred files relating to 27 individuals (18 civilians and 9 Garda&iacute;) identifying possible breaches of section 110.  In the case of the 18 civilians, 8 were directed for prosecution by the DPP.  There have been 4 convictions, a further three cases are pending before the courts and one case was withdrawn by the DPP.  In the case of the 9 Garda&iacute;, the DPP directed a prosecution in 1 case and the accused was acquitted. </p></reply>

This is a function which is undertaken in accordance with strict standards set by the vehicle manufacturers.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the relevant manufacturers have indicated that, for safety reasons, certain patrol vehicles should be withdrawn from service when the odometer reading reaches 300,000 kilometres.  Accordingly, this is the operational policy that is applied by the Garda authorities.  Garda vehicles which have been withdrawn from service having reached 300,000 kilometres are disposed of through an authorised recycling centre.</p></reply>

It is not recognised as such in Ireland at the present time.  Recognition is a matter for the Medical Council and is being pursued with the Council with a view to ensuring that the State, with a view to succession planning,  is in a position to train its own cadre of specialists in forensic pathology.</p><p>  In regard to the question of reform of the inquest system, I can assure the Deputy that while the hearing of an inquest takes place in a public forum and a verdict of a coroner's court is one of public record, coroners are very aware of and sensitive to the tragic circumstances of cases before them and how difficult and traumatic the experience of attending an inquest may be for family members. I am satisfied that Coroners endeavour to treat each case sympathetically and that they do everything that they can to help families contribute to an inquest, as appropriate. The Coroners Review Group which reviewed the Coroner Service and reported in 2000 did not recommend that any particular category of inquest be held other than in public, which has always been the position in this State. The recommendations made by that Group provide the primary basis for the proposals contained in the Coroners Bill 2007 which is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative.</p></reply>

This provides for the making of a compensation order (on application or otherwise) against a convicted person by the court instead of or in addition to dealing with the person in any other way, unless it sees reason to the contrary. This was one of a range of topics relating to sentencing discussed in the course of the lecture.</p><p>  In September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. A working group is carrying out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy, including sentencing. I expect the group to report later this year. The speech delivered last week is a useful addition to the current debate on sentencing.  I am also awaiting a report from the Law Reform Commission on the issue of mandatory sentencing and will not be making any decisions on sentencing policy until I receive both these reports.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that I made an additional &euro;3 million available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year enabling the Commissioner to procure a further 171 Garda vehicles.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the roll out of the most recently purchased patrol vehicles has been completed. Details of the allocation of all 171 vehicles by Region are outlined in the table below. A more detailed breakdown is not currently available.

It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to provide an effective and efficient policing service.  <b>   </b></p></reply>

Approximately 300,000 files relating to the period from Easter Week, 1916, through the War of Independence and Civil War comprise this collection.  The files relate mainly to applications by individuals and/or their dependants for the award of pension and gratuities for veterans who served as members of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, the Hibernian Rifles, the Irish Republican Army, Cumann na mBan, Na Fianna &Eacute;ireann, the National Army/Defence Forces on active service or who were casualties or wounded while on duty during the period from April and May 1916 through to 30 September 1923.  The membership records of these organisations (less that of the National Army) as on 11<sup>th</sup> July 1921 and on 1<sup>st</sup> July 1922 will also be released along with selected administration files and material to put the entire collection in context. This is a significant element of the collection which contains files from the period April and May 1916 to September 1923.    A phased release of material into the public domain is planned.  The first release, which is web based and concentrated on 1916 participants, is planned during 2013. The first release contains files relating to in excess of 3,000 individuals (2395 of these individuals are veterans of Easter Week 1916) and comprising some 452,000 scanned images giving background and context to the individual applications. Databasing and digitizing of these files is now complete and the archivists team are currently testing the web site. This testing phase will be completed in the coming weeks.  Regular releases relating to the War of Independence and Civil War will occur in the run up to 2016.  </p><p>  Subsequent releases will have a web element but it is important to note that not all files will be available online.  Physical visits to the Military Archives will be required to see the full material.  It is envisaged that the provision of accommodation for people wishing to access the Military Archives records and for the storage of the archives will be progressed further under the Government&#8217;s Centenary Programme.</p><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mi</font></p></reply>

The range and availability of medical care provided by St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital strives to meet the occupational needs of the Defence Forces. However, the combination of medical officer and the civilian secondary medical service has a limited capacity and in effect it operates only as an outpatient facility. The contracted civilian consultants conduct regular scheduled clinics for all ranks as required to meet the needs of service personnel. The following are the services provided:</p><p>- Physician, </p><p>- Ear Nose and Throat specialty, </p><p>- Pathology</p><p> - Radiology,</p><p> - Ophthalmology, </p><p> - Periodontal; and </p><p> - Psychiatric services.  </p><p>  Appointments for personnel to attend these services are normally made as a result of referral by a medical officer.  </p><p>  Because of the limited capacity of St. Bricin&rsquo;s personnel may need to be referred for specialist treatment through the public/private care system in civilian hospitals. Where it is necessary to refer enlisted personnel to specialist doctors outside the Defence Forces Medical Corps this is generally done through the public health system and referral onto the public waiting list as the case may be. In certain specific circumstances (Recruits and Cadets), a special case may be made through the Director of the Medical Corps (DMC) for private specialist treatment.  If agreed, the cost of this specialist treatment is currently met by the Defence vote.  </p><p>  In certain circumstances, and if approved by the Brigade/Formation Medical Officer and the Central Medical Unit, Defence Forces Headquarters, commissioned officers may be referred to specialist doctors for consultations, tests and treatment.  The associated approved costs for such consultations, tests and treatment are currently met by the Defence vote.</p></reply>

I am advised that the Defence Forces carry a range of clothing sizes varying from XXS to XXXXL.  Where required, provision is made for an individually sized set of uniforms to be manufactured by the supplier. The Defence Forces issues a comprehensive set of clothing to each member of the Defence Forces which is designed to cope  with a wide range of weather conditions both at home and overseas. In relation to the latter additional supplementary clothing and footwear may be issued where extreme conditions are to be encountered. I am satisfied that the current clothing arrangements are sufficient for the requirements of the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

The mandate sought to conclude a protocol which would oblige Morocco to comply with international law and to report regularly on its use of the funds for the population concerned, including the people of the Western Sahara.  A Council decision of 14 February 2012 authorised the opening of negotiations with Morocco on a new protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and subsequent contacts with the Moroccan authorities. </p><p>  Ireland supported the opening of new negotiations subject to a joint statement with Germany and Slovenia to the effect:-<blockquote><blockquote><i>&#8220;Germany, Ireland and Slovenia  would have preferred an explicit reference to Western Sahara in the mandate.  Germany's, Ireland&#8217;s and Slovenia&#8217;s acceptance of the mandate does not, in any way, pre-empt our final position on any draft Protocol that will eventually be submitted for approval.  The  attitude of each of the above Member States to the draft Protocol will be determined by the extent to which the rights of the people of Western Sahara are protected in accordance with international law and the extent of the related reporting requirements that must be fulfilled by Morocco&#8221;</i></blockquote></blockquote>The 1<sup>st</sup>   round of negotiations on new Fisheries Protocol with Morocco convened in Rabat in November 2012. The fifth round of negotiations took place on 11-12 February, 2013 and agreement was not reached.   It is expected that a further round of negotiations is planned but  no date has  yet  been set.     </p><p>  As President of the European Council of Ministers I have a responsibility to reflect the collective views of Council. As an agreement has not been reached, the signature of an Agreement has not to date come before Council during the Irish Presidency.     </p></reply>

We have now entered the second &ndash; trilogue - phase of the negotiations between the Council, European Parliament and the Commission with the aim of getting political agreement in June. </p><p>  The future programme, like all national spending, will be subject to ongoing budgetary policy. In the case of the new programme a general co-financing rate of 53% is proposed but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, Leader projects, and other measures. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The amount of exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EU funding will depend both on the types of measures that will be included in the Programme and on the co-financing rate, that are agreed with the EU Commission for these measures. </p><p>  In relation to EU funding for the RDP, Ireland&rsquo;s overall allocation has been decided by the European Council in the Multi-annual Financial Framework and this is now with the European Parliament for consent. In light of the fact that neither the content of the programme nor the co-financing rates applicable have yet been determined, it will be appreciated that we are still some way from the point where national decisions on exchequer funding of the new RDP will fall to be made.</p></reply>

This regulation also provides that, in the case of equines which are eligible for entry into a studbook, the passport must be issued by the organisation which is officially approved to manage the studbook for the breed in question in accordance with EU Directive 90/426/EEC.  There are at present eight such organisations approved in Ireland. </p><p>  I indicated in the context of my Department&#8217;s report on Equine DNA and the Mislabelling of Processed Beef that my ultimate objective is to establish a central passport issuing authority for which the Department would have direct control and under which agents would be approved to issue passports.  I also indicated that EU regulations would have to be amended to deliver this centralised arrangement.  In the meantime, the EU Directorate General for Health and Consumers has indicated in its recently published Action Plan for dealing with the fall-out from the horsemeat issue that it intends to submit a proposal to the Council and European Parliament for the transfer responsibility for the issuing of passports from Passport Issuing Organisations to the competent authorities.  A formal Commission proposal is expected in the second half of 2013. </p><p>  My Department has commenced consultations with the passport issuing agencies with a view to enhancing the existing procedures relating to equine passports pending the adoption of the proposed amendment to EU legislation. </p></reply>

It is part of a package of measures aimed at ensuring that all products containing wood placed on the market in the EU are from legally harvested timber.  It applies to wood and wood products being placed for the first time on the EU market.</p><p>  It counters the trade in illegally harvested timber and timber products by imposing three key obligations: placing illegally harvested timber and products derived from such timber on the EU market, for the first time, is prohibited; EU operators &ndash; those who place timber products on the EU market for the first time &ndash; are required to exercise due diligence; traders &ndash; those who buy or sell timber and timber products already on the market &ndash; are required to keep information about their suppliers and customers to make timber easily traceable.  </p><p>  My Department is currently drafting the appropriate legislation that will oversee and enforce these rules in Ireland. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will lay out effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, where appropriate, to ensure compliance.  Official checks will also be carried out which may include visits to premises to monitor and audit material.  It is expected, however, that for the vast majority of those affected, this regulation will involve the reaffirmation of their current business practice.  It will require them to ensure that their paper trail is in a format which can be checked to verify compliance.  The key change this regulation will bring about is to impose a greater responsibility on those placing timber on the market to ensure that their products have been legally harvested.</p></reply>

Participants were required to attend a prescribed number of discussion group meetings or approved national events, in addition to completing two tasks, chosen from a menu of eight designed to enhance on-farm efficiency.  The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.</p><p>  The person named did not qualify for payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks &ndash; the task related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary practitioner.  Participants who chose that task were required to join the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories.  Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland.  Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animal born in 2012.  While the calves born in 2012 were BVD-tested in January 2013, this does not meet the Task requirement for the 2012 Programme.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules.  In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment.  It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no payment is possible in this case. </p></reply>

Thus, I would counsel against drawing conclusions regarding the final outcome at this point in respect of any aspect of the negotiations.  </p><p>  In so far as the value of entitlements is concerned, the Commission has proposed that all Member States move to a national or regional flat-rate payment system by 2019.  I believe that this would involve an unsustainably large transfer of payments between Irish farmers and have argued for an alternative, more measured, approach that acknowledges the need to move from historic references while not going as far or as fast as envisaged by the Commission. </p><p>  In order to avoid the very significant transfers of payments that would result from the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, I proposed an alternative, partial, convergence model based on the principle that Member States should have the flexibility to move away from historically-based systems in a more measured way that respected their individual farming conditions.  I am very pleased that the Council last month endorsed this principle and agreed to include the Irish model in the options available for the distribution of direct payments.  This enhances the prospect of a more reasonable level of transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat-rate proposal. </p><p>  Of course, this issue still has to be negotiated further, and the reality is that the final outcome will be somewhere between the Commission proposal and the Irish proposal.</p></reply>

The report, commissioned by the Irish Timber Council, is appreciated as it clearly outlines the concerns of the timber processing sector about the proposed sale of Coillte harvesting rights and makes a useful contribution to the ongoing analysis.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, further to the Government&rsquo;s decision that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte&rsquo;s forests be considered for sale, the National Treasury Management Agency, via its NewERA Unit, engaged with Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department to examine the financial and other implications of a potential transaction.  Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.  One issue of particular importance to the sector as a whole is the continuity of supply of timber to the processing industry.  As part of the consideration process outlined above, the Coillte State Assets Steering Group, comprising of representatives from NewERA, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department, met with representatives of the Irish Timber Council on 13 March 2013 at which the industry expressed their concerns regarding the proposed sale of Coillte harvesting rights.  I am aware that the Council&rsquo;s main concerns are the continuity of supply of timber to the sawmill sector, the potential prices of timber and the overall implications for their businesses and jobs.  In addition to this meeting, the Steering Group is also considering the report, to which the Deputy refers.</p><p>  The outcome of the overall analysis on the proposed sale of Coillte harvesting rights will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion and no decision has been taken as yet.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.2411.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRPP05100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1010, 1026, 1043 and 1044 together. </p><p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties being experienced by some farmers as a result of recent unseasonable weather.  Difficult conditions experienced on farms last summer have been compounded by an extended winter.  Harsh weather this Spring has led to delayed grass growth, and increased demand for fodder and feed as animals which in normal conditions would be on grass at this time of year have been kept indoors. </p><p>  While it is important to record that the outlook for our livestock sectors remains positive and that prices are relatively strong, it is clear that the conditions prevailing at present have resulted in short term but significant additional management challenges, including cash flow and credit issues for affected farmers faced with the burden of fodder shortages and additional feed costs. </p><p>  In relation to the measures which can be taken to alleviate the problems on farms, I would urge farmers to contact their local Teagasc advisor.  Where winter fodder is limited, Teagasc is providing specific advice and assistance on how to cope with the consequences of the weather conditions experienced this Spring.  Staff at all Teagasc offices are available to provide advice to farmers over the phone and the fodder situation is a constant topic of focus at Discussion Group meetings and other farm walks and events.  Agricultural advisers are equipped and ready to outline the options open to farmers facing difficulties and to make a plan that best suits their situation.  </p><p>  Teagasc has also made extensive use of national and local media to provide farmers with advice and has coordinated with farm organisations, marts, local authorities, co-ops and other industry partners and suppliers to provide targeted advice to all who need it.  In addition, Teagasc network has enabled farmers who have fodder deficits to be connected with those who have surpluses.  Advice for farmers on coping with fodder shortages has also been published, including guidelines to dairy and drystock farmers with little or no grass on feeding this spring.</p><p>  I note also that the farm bodies have urged farmers to assess whether they have surplus fodder in stock and whether they are in a position to make some available to others in difficulty.</p><p>  It is also the case that farmers have increased the usage of concentrates to fill the fodder &#8220;gap&#8221;.  The sales of concentrate feed are significantly up this Spring.  Whilst addressing the fodder issue, this has, in some cases, resulted in problems with cash flow and access to working capital on farms.</p><p>  In response to farmers&#8217; concerns in this regard, I have already written to the banks, and will meet them shortly to highlight the extreme challenges facing farmers as a result of the weather, and to urge them to take a flexible approach to dealing with short term credit issues.  </p><p>  It is important that financial institutions would take into consideration the fact that while the current difficulties may cause cash flow pressures for farmers, the overall outlook for the sector is favourable.  </p><p>  I have also announced an extension to 15 May, 2013 for closing off of Traditional Hay Meadow in Agri &#8211; Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) allowing a deferral of one month to the closing off date.  This will help to maximise grass utilisation in this critical recovery period as the weather improves and grass growth resumes. </p><p>  There is no doubt that the availability of forage on farms is an on-going challenge. The improvement in soil temperatures over the last week is very welcome and should see a return to more normal growth rates for grass and crops alike, and this, together with relatively positive market conditions should see a significant improvement in the situation on farms over the coming weeks.  </p><p>  Agricultural production by its nature is subject to fluctuations in yield and value due the exigencies of the weather as well as global commodity prices.  This was recognised when the Food Harvest targets were being developed and currently in my view there is not a need to review the Food Harvest 2020 targets as at end 2012, the value of primary agricultural production had increased by 21% <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Food Harvest target of achieving a 33% increase in value by 2020.</p></reply>

Additionally, the importation of live wild animals or birds is subject to licence under the Wildlife Act, 1976 which comes under the remit of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (a body under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht). </p><p>  Reports of stray or abandoned animals should be notified to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance and can be dealt with in context of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1965 which are currently the main statutes governing cruelty to all animals. The Animal Health and Welfare Bill which I have brought forward consolidates a wide range of existing legislation affecting welfare of animals and when enacted will be enforced by a range of state bodies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Customs Officers and Local Authorities.  The Bill deals with the welfare of animals during sale and the sale of animals to minors. It also enshrines the five freedoms that underpin animal welfare and, in doing so, sets out general horizontal rules on feed, shelter, healthcare and welfare that will apply to all animals.</p><p>  My Department provides financial support to animal welfare organisations some of whom have exotic animals in their care.  In December 2012, funding of &#8364;1.365 million was awarded to 140 organisations. Members of the public should seek advice about pet care, particularly with regard to the keeping of exotic animals from a private veterinary practitioner and their local animal welfare organisation.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 (which replaced Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004) provides that where there is an over-declaration of the area declared, applicants are not entitled to benefit from payment until the over-claim is resolved. The provisions of Regulation 1122/2009 also provide for the imposition of penalties in respect of over-declarations. The Deputy will be aware that the area claimed by the claimants for many years comprises of more land than there is available on Glenary Commonage for the purposes of the Single Payment Scheme and the other area-based schemes.</p><p>  Furthermore, my Department has no jurisdiction in relation to disputes over Title, Ownership or grazing claims to land.  All parties to this dispute have been made aware of this. The law on incorporal hereditaments is very complex. The establishment and loss of same is governed by the prescription acts and common law. In this case Legal Title is based on a Land Commission Vesting Order<font color="#FF0000"> </font>dated 30 June 1950. Other parties may have established grazing rights on the mountain and other parties may have lost same. This is obviously a matter of evidence and the Circuit or High Court has jurisdiction in the matter. The area is further complicated in that grazing rights invariably attach to appurtenant lowland and from our experience the court orders obtained by claimants are based on the common law principles of 'Levancy and Couchancy'. In simple terms this means that the right to graze is based upon the ability of a person&#8217;s lowland to sustain the sheep for the winter period.</p><p>  I would also like to bring to the attention of the Deputy the efforts made by this Department to find a resolution to this dispute. In particular, I wish to refer to the number of meetings organised by this Department at which efforts were made to resolve the dispute and allow payments to issue. In addition, officers of this Department have spent much time over many years in discussions with the parties involved. However, no resolution could be achieved despite the efforts made by this Department to secure a settlement. </p><p>  I would strongly urge all of the parties directly involved with this commonage and their representatives to come together and seek a resolution to this matter.  Their cooperation and agreement is the only way in which this matter can be resolved.</p></reply>

The HLIC, which I chair, consists of the senior officials of all state agencies involved in the agriculture, food and fisheries sector.

By end 2010, the latest data available from the CSO, value added production had improved by 5.6%.</p><p>  As you will be aware, the volume of milk production is currently constrained by EU quotas.  Significant volume increase will not take place until the EU milk quotas are abolished in 2015.  In the meantime, steps are being taken at primary and commercial level, through initiatives such as the dairy efficiency programme, capital investment in processing equipment, marketing and trade promotions, to ensure that the industry can capitalise on this valuable opportunity. </p><p>  Volume increase has already been achieved in fish processing levels which have risen by over 60% on the Food Harvest baseline figures.</p></reply>

This review, arising from a Government commitment that such be undertaken, commenced in 2010 and was undertaken by a group consisting of representatives of the forestry sector.  The review of forestry policy is currently in the process of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), which includes consultation with statutory bodies and the general public. It is anticipated that the process will be concluded by the end of July after which it is planned to issue the report, taking account of any further inputs received during the SEA process.</p></reply>

These proposed reductions are still the subject of negotiations and there is no certainty as to the final outcome.</p><p>  In the case of the reductions proposed for the national reserve and the young farmers&rsquo; scheme, the percentages currently proposed are for maximum deductions of 3% and 2% respectively.  However, the final deductions may be less &ndash; depending on the funding needs for these schemes.</p><p>  As regards the crisis fund, there is an additional complication in that there is a disagreement between the Commission, Council and European Parliament as to whether annual payments below &euro;5,000 should be exempt from deductions to finance this.  The Commission has proposed a franchise of &euro;5,000.  The European Parliament has proposed no franchise and the Council has suggested a limit of &euro;2,000.  This will have to be resolved before any meaningful modelling can be carried out on the impact.</p><p>  Equally, there is disagreement between the three institutions on the level of coupling that should be allowed with the Commission arguing for a 5% limit in the case of Member States such as Ireland who have fully decoupled payments, the Council advocating a maximum level of 7% for these Member States and the European Parliament seeking a maximum of 15%.  And of course, coupled payments are proposed as an option for Member States.  I do not intend to take a decision whether to proceed with a deduction for coupled payments until the deal is finalised and the full outcome known.</p><p>  Given the extent of variables that I have outlined above, it would be premature, in my view, to attempt an exercise that would superimpose the impacts of various models of internal convergence on the other factors playing out in these negotiations.</p></reply>

Section 25 of the Bill provides for the adoption of Codes of Practice for the purposes of providing practical guidance relating to any of the purposes of the Act. Sub-section 25(7) states that a failure to observe a code of practice (where there was a code of practice in effect at the time of the commission of an offence) is admissible in evidence before a court.

Accordingly, the matter will now be tabled at an Appeals Committee meeting in late April. </p><p>  I opposed the proposal on the basis that, procedurally, the EU Commission proposal should be based on the EFSA conclusions and current proposal seeks to go beyond these.  The procedure to date has been for the Commission to approve (or not) an active substance, in consultation with the Member States.  Then each Member State approves, or not, products, containing those approved substances, and specifies risk mitigation measures, where appropriate.  The proposal is taking the decision making process away from Member States and thus ignores the principle of subsidiarity, whereby approval of an individual product at Member State level has heretofore been a matter of Member State competence.  I am concerned that a precedent may be set for the future handling of active substances and authorisation of products.</p><p>  I also had some technical concerns with the proposal, including the proposed prohibition for use on some crops that are not attractive to bees and the proposed prohibition for use on crops based on the time of year that they would be sown.  Finally, I noted that the risk relating to the use of alternatives, to replace the prohibited neonicotinoids, has not been assessed or considered.  </p><p>  Prior to the vote on the Commission proposal, I received correspondence from the chemical industry, the farming sector, non-governmental organisations and members of the general public.</p></reply>

My Department is not aware that the mortality has caused the closure of farms, but marine sites are fallowed regularly as part of best practice and to fulfil licence conditions.</p><p>  The treatment of choice for <i>Neoparamoeba perurans</i> , the causative agent of AGD, is to bathe the fish in freshwater for 2-3 hours, which causes lysis (cell breakdown) of the pathogen.

My Department&#8217;s policy on sea lice management is strictly evidence based.  The control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>-the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry</p><p>-data obtained as a result of inspections is published</p><p>-treatment trigger levels are set at a low level</p><p>  The control protocols have been the subject of detailed investigation and testing by the EU Commission which has confirmed that it regards the sea lice protocols operated in Ireland as representing best practice internationally.</p></reply>

No. 311 of 2010 gives effect to a series of European Directives concerning the protection of animals, including horses, kept for farming purposes. Department Veterinary Inspectors are designated authorised officers under these Regulations.  The provisions of the Protection of animals Act 1911, as amended by 1995 Act, applies in the case of cruelty to all animals.</p><p>  The identification and registration of equines is governed by EU Council Directives 90/426/EEC and 90/427/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 504/2008. The latter regulation, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, provides that equine animals registered after that date<b></b>  must be identified with a passport and a microchip. This regulation applies to all equines, including equines not deemed to be bloodstock or sport horses.</p><p>  The EU legislation relating to the identification and traceability of equines has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st</sup>  of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain. S.I. No 357 of 2011 was amended in September 2012 by S.I. 371 of 2012 in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport. Passports are essential in the control and prevention of disease, in public health and animal welfare.</p><p>  My Department introduced enhanced<b></b>legislation and procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises such that, from 1 May 2012, anyone who is the owner/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with my Department.  Keepers seeking to register equines are required to have a herd number registered with my Department and to keep records of movements on/off their premises. This legislation applies to all equines.</p></reply>

This shows that, in general, farmers with payments per hectare above the national average (&euro;272/ha) had significantly higher stocking densities that farmers with payments below the national average.  Of course there would be individual exceptions to these results.

The objective of this process is to get a view on the level of potential interest in particular assets and hear of any concerns about specific issues, etc., in advance of the commencement of any formal disposal process.  The procedure as envisaged under the protocol is important in terms of the various Government entities involved presenting a single consistent and coherent front to market participants and/or advisers in advance of the commencement of any formal disposal process. I understand that, following the receipt of formal requests under the procedure outlined in the protocol, meetings with potential market participants/advisers and concerned parties have taken place with the objective of receiving the perspectives of those requesting the meetings.</p></reply>

This is provided for  under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991. The service has eliminated  the placing of children in a hospital setting due to a family emergency. Children stay in the emergency foster care placement for between one and three nights (over a weekend) until the local social work service is available to deal with the case. Examples of when this is needed is where a parent/s may have an emergency admission to hospital, or where a parent is found to be unable or unfit to care for a child in the immediate situation. </p><p>-	  The HSE provides and funds preventative services to identify to children and families to avoid situations where children leave home due to discord or abuse. Theses service include family support, youth services, family therapy and counselling. </p><p>-	  A small number of short term residential hostel places are available to   support for young people under 18  who are out of home. </p><p>  The Programme for Government 2011-2016 commits inter-alia, to (i) end long term homelessness and the need to sleep rough for all (ii) review and update the existing Homeless Strategy. </p><p>  A review of progress of my Department's National Strategy for Youth Homelessness (for under 18)  was undertaken in 2008 by the HSE in conjunction with other agencies, and found that significant progress had been made, especially in the areas of interagency cooperation, early prevention and an &lsquo;out of hours&rsquo; service. A major decrease in demand for hostel places was found. </p><p>  My Department  engaged the Centre for Effective Services (CES) to undertake a review of the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy, 2001, to establish the extent that the strategy has been successful and to identify any blockages or challenges to its implementation. CES has consulted with the relevant service providers, NGOs and young people as part of this process. The report is now complete and I plan to publish it shortly. </p><p>  The Report will indicate that there have been significant improvements in the service response to youth homelessness in the last 10 years. Improved services for children in care, especially for older teenagers are evident. Positive implications of the changed responses to youth homelessness can be deduced from the fact no child under the age of 18 was found to be sleeping rough during the rough sleeper counts conducted by the Dublin Region Homeless in Dublin in November 2011.  My Department will examine recommendations in conjunction with the HSE and other Government Departments. </p><p>  My Department and the HSE are working closely with the Department of the Environment to support young people over 18 years in aftercare, and other vulnerable young people to make the transition to stable accommodation.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.173m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  These projects and schemes operate in Dublin City and throughout the country. These supports are designed to be preventative and to address a range of issues affecting young people and their communities including early school leaving, unemployment, drug/substance misuse, youth homelessness, and the impact of problems to do with juvenile crime and anti-social behaviour. Young people are provided with a wide range of programmes and activities, which respond to their needs, interests, capacity and age profile. </p><p>  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality has overall responsibility in the area of crime and anti-social behaviour and his Department funds a range of  youth services, in particular Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) and Young Person Probation Projects (YPP), in areas of greatest need with a specific youth crime intervention approach, targeting those involved in or at risk of offending behaviour through early intervention work. These services are linking with other youth services provided by my Department to support effective crime prevention approaches by equipping young people with experiences and skills and competences that will enhance their development and their positive engagement in their local communities.</p></reply>

The Policy Framework is expected to be published in mid 2013 and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland&rsquo;s first Children&rsquo;s Strategy which was published in 2000.  The National Early Years Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is already under development and is expected to be completed later this year.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and  family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education, including literacy and numeracy.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the 'Growing up in Ireland' study.  It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Interventions Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources.  The major programme of institutional change which is currently underway, including the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, will also be taken into account.</p><p>  My Department provides significant support to parents to assist them with the cost of childcare.  This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low incomes.</p><p>  The CETS programme was introduced in September 2010 and provides &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.    </p><p>  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector. This initiative, which represents a full year investment of &euro;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  </p><p>  In 2013, the total expenditure by my Department on these support programmes is expected to be in the region  &euro;260 million.  These programmes have been maintained and expanded despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.</p></reply>

The SCP is one of three service strands, which also includes the Home School Community Liaison and the Education Welfare Service, being integrated under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.</p><p>  In 2013, funding of &euro;26.456m has been made available by my Department to support the programme, which involves 124 projects and initiatives throughout the country.</p><p>  The Local Management Committee assesses the needs of marginalised educationally disadvantaged students at local level to devise an integrated, costed and targeted proposal of interventions to support these young people. </p><p>  The structure of the retention plan is required to encompass four distinct pillars of support to include, in-school, after-school (including breakfast clubs), holiday and out of school supports. This project model approach, allows the Local Management Committee the autonomy to be creative and innovative in developing strategies to encourage attendance, retention and participation of the targeted young people. Accordingly, it is a matter for the SCP to decide on the use of SCP funds in the context of the available grant and the overall programme of activities.</p><p>  In September 2012, the Local Management Committee responsible for each SCP project was notified that a reduction on last year&rsquo;s allocation would apply for the coming academic cycle. Nonetheless a significant  level of funding  of &euro;274,761 was made available, to the School Completion Project raised by the Deputy, for the 12/13 academic year.</p><p>  Projects were requested to revise their plans for 2012/13 in order to achieve efficiencies and reduce costs whilst prioritising evidence based services to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), under the remit of my Department, has provided assistance to projects through this process in accordance with its management responsibilities for the programme.</p><p>  In the present challenging financial circumstances it is not feasible to alter the notified allocations to individual projects. I would note that my Department intends to complete a review of the SCP over the course of 2013. It is anticipated that the review will assist in identifying operational efficiencies and other reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing as a key component of an integrated school support service under the NEWB. </p><p>  With regard to the wider question of other services that are available to children before attending and after leaving DEIS schools daily, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. Funding of some &euro;53.173m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which is implemented by my Department, provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced rates to qualifying parents for childcare provision including breakfast and after school clubs. </p><p>  A new After School programme is being introduced later this year by my Department, in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection, which will provide funding to enable participating childcare services, both commercial and community, to provide after school care at reduced rates to qualifying parents.</p></reply>

A number of initiatives were introduced to encourage childminders exempt from notification under the Regulations to voluntarily notify their services.</p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post or provide a staff member in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.</p><p>  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.</p><p>  In recent years, the HSE made a decision to gradually reduce the level of funding and support for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.</p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.</p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.</p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of our Early Years sector, aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to the age of six.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p></reply>

HSE West Region comprises the following 5 areas;</p><p>- Donegal</p><p>- Sligo / Leitrim / West Cavan</p><p>- Mayo</p><p>- Galway / Roscommon</p><p>- Mid West (Limerick / Clare / North Tipperary)</p><p>  The objectives of this assessment were twofold:</p><p>- Identify if recommendations arising from the RCCC Report relating to service delivery have been implemented and to what extent.</p><p>- Support the due diligence exercise that is required as part of the transfer of child care services from the HSE to the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p><p>  The team found sufficient evidence that the following RCCC recommendations have been implemented:</p><p>- Organisation change, including establishment of a national management tea</p><p>- Court processes</p><p>- Staff roles, particularly in respect to contact with children</p><p>- Observations made on home visits</p><p>- Working with fathers</p><p>- Child Protection plans</p><p>- Follow-up on, and feedback in relation to, third party concerns</p><p>- Key designated worker role</p><p>- Targeted family support service developed for Roscommon, and review of the effectiveness of the Home Management Service</p><p>- Children First Guidelines implemented locally</p><p>  Partial evidence was found that the following recommendations have been implemented, and most are works in progress:</p><p>  - Policies and procedures for all stages in the child welfare and protection system</p><p>  - Practice audits and quality assurance</p><p>  - Reporting up of escalating risks and cases of public importance</p><p>  - Implementation of a common assessment framework</p><p>  - Alternative plans</p><p>  - Working with parents who seek to distract workers</p><p>  - Involvement of Speech and Language (S&amp;L) Department, and review of Public Health Nursing (PHN) records</p><p>  - Specialised Child Sexual Abuse Unit or Team in place</p><p>  - Staff management, including supervision and caseload management</p><p>  - Child protection case conferences processes and chairpersons</p><p>  - Standardised file recording and file management systems</p><p>  - Appropriate staff training</p><p>  Insufficient evidence was found that the following 4 recommendations have been implemented:</p><p>- Victim impact statements: The audit team were advised that guidance was intended to be issued to Children and Family staff on the preparation and presentation of victim impact statements and the right of children in care to privacy.  This was to be subject to clearance from Legal Services. This matter remains outstanding. </p><p>- Documenting frequency and purpose of home visits: The audit did find that home visits did appear to occur regularly.  A number of developments are in train which will ensure that this recommendation is addressed.  A National Record Management Strategy will be implemented in Quarter 2.  The National Staff Supervision Policy was launched on the 22nd March 2013 and a detailed implementation plan is in place. The introduction of the new policy will provide an important opportunity to provide a renewed focus on a number of areas.  </p><p>- Outcomes measurement: The National Child Protection Notification project is in the process of developing Guidelines with Supporting Documentation on Child Protection Conference and the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS).  Under these guidelines, the requirement for Child Protection places to have achievable measurable child focused outcomes with timeframes will be clearly set out.  Child Protection and Welfare Inspections have commenced by HIQA and forthcoming recommendations from these will be implemented and associated learning disseminated. </p><p>- Staff alert to Attachment theory, and testing assumptions in supervision: Liaison between the Regional Workforce Development Manager and the Area Managers on training needs has been ongoing in agreeing training priorities for 2013, which includes attachment training. The plan will be kept under review and there will be ongoing liaison in respect of the priorities between the Regional Service Director and the National Manager for Workforce Development.</p></reply>

Some &euro;800,000 of this has been allocated to the PEIP in 2013, its final year.  </p><p>  The PEIP is co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies (AP) to examine innovative and integrated ways to improve outcomes for children.  PEIP supports projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour. These programmes are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.</p><p>  The three PEIP sites are expected to participate in the new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative, which was announced in Budget 2013 and will be implemented by my Department from later this year.  The Initiative, which will build on and continue the work of the PEIP, will deliver the Government's commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  A key objective will be to improve outcomes for children and young people where these are currently significantly poorer than they are for children and young people living elsewhere in the State.</p><p>  The Area-Based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative has a funding allocation of &euro;2.500 million in 2013 and this is expected to rise to &euro;4.750 million by 2015.  It is hoped that the Initiative will be co-funded by philanthropic partners and discussions are ongoing to this end.  </p></reply>

PEIP supports projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour. These programmes are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.  </p><p> The Early Years Programme referred to by the Deputy was coordinated by the Childhood Development Initiative (CDI), a participant in the PEIP, and was developed with the aim of supporting and targeting families in Tallaght West whose children may have faced barriers to educational achievement and well-being.    An evaluation of the programme found that children who took part in the tailored programme demonstrated improved attendance, behaviour and social skills on entry to school.</p><p>  The three PEIP sites are expected to participate in the new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative which my Department will my Department will be introducing later this year.  This initiative was announced in December 2012 and is intended to build on and continue the work of the PEIP.  It has a funding allocation of &euro;2.5m in Budget 2013 which is expected to rise to &euro;4.75 by 2015. Discussions are on-going with Atlantic Philanthropies in the hope of securing matching funding for the new initiative. </p><p>  The Initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people where these are currently significantly poorer than they are for children and young people living elsewhere in the State.  New Area-Based Approach to Child Poverty sites will be required to implement programmes which have been shown by rigorous research to have a positive impact on the lives of children.</p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is already under development and is expected to be completed later this year.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and  family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education, including literacy and numeracy.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the 'Growing up in Ireland' study.  It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Interventions Projects, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources.  The major programme of institutional change which is currently underway, including the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, will also be taken into account.</p></reply>

Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding. </p><p>  Funding provided by my Department to support youth projects in the Dublin City area is administered, on behalf of my Department, by the City of Dublin Youth Services Board (CDYSB).

This facility is open to all such bodies administering funding for the provision of youth services on behalf of my Department.  Such proposals were received from CDYSB this year following notification of the allocations by my Department and, where the proposals recommended that funding cuts in excess of the 10% reduction be applied, my Department directed that, with a small number of exceptions, no project in the Dublin City area would be reduced by more than the 10% required by the CRE.  </p><p>  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board was notified of this decision and revised proposals in this regard were submitted by CDYSB and approved by my Department.</p><p>  I have met, and will continue to meet, with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings.

Funding of some &euro;53.173m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>The overall funding of &euro;53.173m available for the provision of youth services in 2013 includes capital funding of &euro;1.75m.  &euro;1m of this capital funding is being made available for the provision of new youth caf&eacute;s in 2013.  I do not accept the need; as the Deputy seems to be suggesting; for a review of my decision to allocate this funding in 2013 for the development of new youth caf&eacute;s. The availability of capital funding in 2013 reinforces the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the extension of quality youth caf&eacute; throughout the country, in particular noting the repeated emphasis that young people have placed on the need for safe, alcohol-free recreational facilities. Since becoming Minister I have been greatly encouraged by the quality of the projects that have already been grant-aided under previous Youth Caf&eacute; funding schemes.</p><p>The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings.</p><p>The funding allocated for the provision of youth services in Co. Dublin is administered by Co. Dublin VEC on behalf of my Department.  It is open to that body, as it is to all bodies administering funding to youth services/programmes on behalf of my Department, to submit proposals to my Department to reconfigure the allocations made by the Department, based on their local knowledge and expertise in relation to the youth projects in their area.  Co. Dublin VEC submitted such proposals to my Department and following consideration in the Department these proposals were approved.  It is my understanding that Co. Dublin VEC have consulted with the projects in the Clondalkin/Lucan area and assured them of their continued support for these projects in managing the resources available in the most effective and efficient way.</p><p>In 2013, the youth funding amounting to almost &euro;1.5 million has been allocated to services in the Clondalkin and Lucan area.  This includes:</p><p><b>Youth Affairs Funding 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Special Projects for Youth</th><th>&#8364;262,331</th></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities Services Fund 1</td><td>&#8364;479,965</td></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities Services Fund 2</td><td>&#8364;666,373</td></tr><tr><td>Youth Information Centre</td><td>&#8364;49,001</td></tr><tr><td>Traveller Development</td><td>&#8364;33,545</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition, Co. Dublin VEC disperses small grant support, funded by my Department, to local voluntary youth clubs in the Lucan &amp; Clondalkin areas. The Deputy should note that under the Comprehensive Review of expenditure, I have ensured that there has been no cut to the total national funding being provided by my Department to support the local voluntary youth club grant schemes as this funding plays an important role in supporting volunteer-led youth groups and in promoting and leveraging valuable voluntary activity in youth work.</p></reply>

The Government has made a very significant commitment in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the current budgetary situation.   The universal nature of this programme is critical for childhood development by providing every child with early learning and preparation for school. </p><p>  The ECCE programme includes a number of additional provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions should be made prior to the child commencing the programme.</p><p>  It is my view that it would be extremely helpful to many children if a second pre-school year were to be provided.  This would be particularly beneficial for children with special needs and I would like to be in a position to deliver on this.  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding and I must operate within the financial constraints under which the rest of the Government is operating.  The ECCE programme will continue to be evaluated and developed as resources permit.</p></reply>

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.  There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.</p><p>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth services. Youth work and non-formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience, motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21st century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&rsquo;s world.</p><p>  The role of research and consultations with youth sector interests and the young people themselves are central elements in my Department&rsquo;s approach to the formulation of the youth policy services that are responsive to young peoples needs.   My Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth work to advance our understanding of the impact of youth services in the lives of children and young people. The study will inform a new Youth Policy Framework which is planned by my Department for later this year. The findings of the Growing Up In Ireland Study of my Department and other studies including EU studies have been significant in relation to providing information about children and young peoples experience of bullying and its impact on them.</p><p>  The Action Plan on Bullying - produced by cross-sectoral working group on which my Department and the youth services were represented, contains a range of evidence based actions to support parents, young people, schools and community interests, in tackling this issue which can have a serious impact on young people. My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Action Plan in supporting initiatives to raise awareness about the problem and implementing identified actions to tackle prejudice and promote a safer environment for our young people. The Youth Clubs funded by my Department are an important outlet for children and young people in this context.  Their activities can help to build self esteem, increase confidence and strengthen friendships so that young people are better equipped to counter bullying behaviour.</p><p>  The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department also provides funding towards the administration of the National Youth Health Programme.  This programme is a partnership between my Department, the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) and the Health Service Executive.  Funding of some &euro;83,940 has been allocated to the programme in 2013 by my Department. The aim of the programme is to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings. The programme has sought to develop the capacity of the sector and organisations to advocate on issues that affect young people and develop evidenced based resources and training to support that work.  The advantage of this training is evident in the fact that Youth Work often acts as the first point of contact and referral in the interface with other youth-related services spanning the realms of care, health and welfare.</p><p>  My Department works closely with the youth sector organisations to address the needs of children and young people. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee is an important source of advice and guidance to my Department in developing youth policy and initiatives.  The committee is composed of a chairperson and 32 members drawn equally from the voluntary and statutory sectors involved in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services. This committee advises my Department on matters relating to the development and coordination of youth work policies, programmes and services. </p><p>  In addition, The Late Night League (LNL) Programme, for which my Department provides funding under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, is a diversionary programme incorporating soccer leagues at various locations across Dublin. It is aimed at encouraging at risk juveniles to participate in meaningful activities, thus reducing anti-social behaviour involving young people in the selected areas. It also provides a forum which promotes positive lifestyle choices away from problems such as homelessness. Open to young people aged 13-21, this diversionary programme takes place in disadvantaged areas during prime anti-social hours such as Friday nights.  This initiative has proved to be very successful with teams from both the travelling and settled community participating and other diverse groups. The initiative is based around the concept of using football as a tool for social inclusion and learning.</p><p>  There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the significance of youth work in promoting young people&rsquo;s development, health and well-being, enhancing their participation in education, training and employment and the potential youth work has, as part of wider strategies to respond to the challenges that arise. I am delighted to have hosted an EU Youth Conference in March 2013.  This conference, organised by my Department in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI), was the flagship event in the Irish Presidency Youth Programme and it was the culmination of the EU wide consultation with youth on the theme of social inclusion in which young people in all 27 Member States are currently participating.  The seven thematic areas identified were; </p><p>  Employment &ndash; employment leads to inclusion</p><p>  Education &ndash; inclusive education for all young people</p><p>  Participation &ndash; equal rights and equal opportunities to participate in civic life</p><p>  Welfare &ndash; access to welfare</p><p>  Support &ndash; social and youth services for young people</p><p>  Youth organisations &ndash; youth organisations and social inclusion</p><p>  Quality &ndash; assuring quality in youth work to ensure social inclusion</p><p>  Young people and Ministry officials from the 27 Member States have jointly defined the 21 conclusions arising from the Conference. The conclusions from this Conference will be brought forward in the current trio cycle and will inform the Structured Dialogue components of the Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies, which will ultimately inform the development of a Council Resolution on Structured Dialogue at the end of this current Presidency Trio.  This is a clear and compelling example of young people&rsquo;s voices and vision directly informing youth policy.</p><p>  I have met, and will continue to meet, with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of the savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and to see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to continue to support the provision of quality youth services to young people.</p></reply>

Flagship initiatives such as the Growing Up in Ireland Study are focused on securing good evidence on children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s lives and outcomes, and should provide future opportunity to follow children&rsquo;s lives from childhood to early adulthood and examine the factors that impact later outcomes.</p><p>  The National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives 2011-2016 sets out a comprehensive action plan for research and data on children&rsquo;s lives in Ireland and proposes a systematic, harmonised and coordinated approach across departments and agencies to achieve a better understanding of children&rsquo;s lives including research actions so that children&rsquo;s educational outcomes will be better understood.</p><p>  School absenteeism is one of the strongest known risk factors associated with early school leaving and research confirms the enduring nature of the difficulties which arise from high levels of absenteeism and associated poor educational achievement.</p><p>  There is a body of evidence on this from work carried out by the ESRI and others in the area of education research and early school leaving and its impact on access to employment and the risk of poverty. This evidence has informed a range of policy responses introduced by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills and others to promote school retention and support young people&rsquo;s participation in education. The Department will explore areas for future research on issues related to youth employment in the context of the new Children&rsquo;s and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework, which is currently being developed by this Department.</p><p>  Combating the issues underlying poor school attendance requires concerted action and close collaboration among schools, school support services and other stakeholders involved with children, young people and their families. My Department is committed to supporting the educational attainment of young people, in particular by targeting supports to young people from disadvantaged communities through a variety of formal and informal educational support services.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), which operates under the remit of my Department, has a mandate to ensure that &lsquo;each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education&rsquo;. The Board&rsquo;s services, which include the Educational Welfare Service, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, operate within an integrated continuum of services to deliver a range of services from the universal and preventative activities up to more intensive interventions where required. The work of the Board is a key component of Delivering Equality of opportunity in Schools (DEIS), the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. The latest NEWB report of the Analysis of School Attendance Data shows that the percentage of student days lost through absence is running at just over 6% (or 11 school days per year) in primary schools and around 8% (or 13 school days per year) in post-primary schools. These figures continue to show a slight improvement in attendance over time since the introduction of this analysis by the NEWB.</p><p>  While the overall improvement is to be welcomed the number of children who continue to miss school each day, in particular in areas of social and economic disadvantage, remains a concern. This is why we must maintain our focus and target resources effectively to secure further improvements in educational outcomes for children in at risk groups.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s youth work services and programmes also play an important role for young people who encounter difficulties with school attendance in that engagement in youth activities complements the formal learning in the school system. Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout the country. There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance learning and contribute to employability of young people and that it may have a particular role as part of a wider education, employment and enterprise strategy for those young people who are marginalised from more formalised systems of education and training. This priority theme is being explored further as part of the Ireland&rsquo;s Youth Presidency Programme. I plan, as part of the Presidency programme, to host an expert round table event on quality youth work and its contribution to youth employment (20&ndash;21 June 2013, Kildare).</p><p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills and other Government departments to ensure that policy is informed by the best available evidence and to ensure a consistent approach is taken to achieving our shared policy objectives for children and young peoples educational outcomes.</p></reply>

The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency. It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &euro;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team. </p><p>  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p><p>  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function. </p><p>  The new Child and Family Support Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.</p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of bullying raised by the Deputy, the Action Plan on Bullying - produced by cross-sectoral working group on which my Department was represented, contains a range of evidence based actions to support parents, young people, schools and community interests, in tackling this issue which can have a serious impact on young people. My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Action Plan and is undertaking a series of initiatives to raise awareness about the problem and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

However, the challenges faced by some older people are acknowledged. While many of the challenges might be described as human rights issues and while gaps in protections for older people have been identified, older people worldwide are not a homogenous group and discussions need to continue to identify existing implementation gaps. I believe that it is in our best interests to continue to concentrate effort on effective implementation of existing instruments and make better use of existing mechanisms for monitoring and appraisal of the situation of older people in society.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note the General Assembly resolution 67/139 of 13 February 2013, entitled &quot;Towards a comprehensive and integral international legal instrument to promote and protect the rights and dignity of older persons&quot; in which the open-ended working group on ageing is mandated starting from its upcoming fourth session to be held in 2013, to consider proposals for an international legal instrument to promote and protect the rights and dignity of older persons. I would like to assure the Deputy that the challenges and opportunities associated with ageing will continue to be given a priority by the Government and my Department will work with colleagues in other Government Departments and in appropriate international fora to ensure continued effective and constructive collaboration in relation to the situation of older people in society.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.</p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination, in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.

I met with both representative organisations in July 2011 and have been in correspondence since.</p><p>  Given the challenges that persist for each individual, this Government's aim is to address the health and personal social care needs of thalidomide survivors living in Ireland.  I have stated that I am willing to enter into discussions about a health care package on a non-statutory basis; an ex-gratia payment having regard to current financial circumstances; and a statement to the D&aacute;il recognising the challenges faced by survivors.</p><p>  The Irish Thalidomide Association announced publicly in 2012 that it had ceased talks with the Government. The Association's legal advisor has initiated personal injuries claims against the manufacturer and distributors of the Thalidomide drug and the State.</p><p>  The Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society is seeking, amongst other things, an independent agency with ring fenced funding to provide for a statutory package to provide for their needs including health and personal services, housing adaptations, heating, transport and clothing. I am not in a position to meet the demands of the Society. I would also point out that each Irish thalidomide survivor has a medical card and it is open to each individual to apply for the numerous public supports available to people with a disability provided by other Departments such as housing adaptation grants, disabled drivers tax concessions and disability allowance. However, I have asked the Society to consider, in good faith, proceeding with a Health Care Protocol which envisaged appointing and training a multi-disciplinary team, arranging a multi-disciplinary health evaluation, identifying and documenting their health care needs/issues and developing plans to address those needs. The Society are unwilling to proceed on that basis.</p><p>  There are currently 32 Irish Thalidomide survivors.  Each survivor received lump sum payments from a German Foundation and the Irish Government in the early 1970s.  In 1975 the lump-sums paid by the Irish Government ranged from &euro;6,400 to &euro;21,000.  In addition, each survivor receives on-going monthly payments from both the German Foundation and the Irish Government.  Combining the Irish and German payments, most individuals receive over &euro;2,500 per month, or &euro;575 per week tax free.</p></reply>

In the 2013 National Service Plan (NSP), the HSE's priority is to maximise the provision of services to people with disabilities within available resources and to maintain a consistent level to that provided for in 2012, including the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.</p><p>  The demand for life-skills training and day services for school-leavers with disabilities continues to grow.  The HSE expects that approximately 700 school-leavers will require services in 2013.  I am pleased to confirm that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4m to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on the percentage of population.</p><p>  The recommendations of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services (New Directions) will guide the reconfiguration and modernisation of HSE funded adult day services and will underpin the collaborative action in terms of flexibility and innovation when addressing requirements for school leavers in 2013.</p><p>  Currently the National Disability Unit is liaising with the Regional Leads for Disability Services in terms of a cohesive and collaborative approach to meeting the needs of school leavers within the resources available.

These communications have been both oral and written.  In addition , an official from my Department is a member of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body (AMCMB).  This body monitors adherence and compliance with voluntary codes of practice on the placement of alcohol advertising, and the drinks industry has one representative on this body.</p><p>  I wish to also advise the Deputy that real and tangible proposals are now being finalised on the basis of the National Substance Misuse Strategy recommendations and I expect to submit them as soon as possible to the Government for consideration and approval.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. The new UHI system will be underpinned by a robust legislative framework and grounded in the principles of open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating.</p><p>  The Department is preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland.  As part of this work, policy proposals are being developed in relation to defining the scope and content of services covered by the standard UHI package.  Following careful consideration by Government, these proposals will feed into the development of the published White Paper.</p><p>  In advance of the White Paper, I published The Path to Universal Healthcare: A Preliminary Paper on Universal Health Insurance in February 2013. This document provides a comprehensive update on progress achieved to date and sets out the main actions for the road ahead in relation to laying the foundations for UHI.</p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. </p><p>  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.</p></reply>

The National Service Plan sets out the quantum and type of health services to be provided in 2013 within the overall level of funding provided.</p><p>  In accordance with the Act Minister Reilly approved the Plan and laid a copy before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9<sup>th</sup>   January this year.  Subsequently, the Executive prepared and published its Operational Plan and Regional Service Plans which underpin the National Service Plan. </p><p>  The HSE has responsibility for the delivery of services set out in these Regional Plans and to ensure that services are delivered within budget.   The demand for these services will continue to grow with changing demographics, and the associated complex needs of an ageing population.  At the last Census, there were over 535,000 people over the age of 65 in Ireland. This was an increase of 14.4% since the 2011 Census. It is estimated that by 2041, there will be between 1.3m and 1.4m people over the age of 65 in Ireland, with the greatest increases in the over 80 age group.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department is working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding future public nursing home provision for the Minister&#8217;s consideration.  The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the on-going need to meet service and safety standards; all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.  Additional work is needed before this exercise can be completed and a set of proposals presented to the Minister for consideration. </p><p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, <i>A Fair Deal, </i>is a demand - led, resource capped system of financial support for people assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.   Funding is currently being released on a weekly basis. At end of January it was taking an average of 34 days for funding to issue, from the date that the person's application was determined.</p><p>  The 2013 Service Plan sets a target of 22,761 people to be in receipt of financial support at end-2013, compared to 22,065 at end-2012.  Approvals will continue to be granted and the position will be kept under constant weekly review.  The HSE is  monitoring the Scheme on a weekly basis and has demonstrated its ability to manage this process effectively.</p><p>  Work on the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is ongoing. The review will include an examination of the on-going sustainability of the Scheme. It is expected that the review will be completed in 2013. </p></reply>

Under the Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  </p><p>  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:</p><p>(a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; </p><p>(b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and</p><p>(c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. </p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:</p><p>-	  there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and</p><p>-	  any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.   	</p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.     </p><p>  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputy. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.2874.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRXX02500"><p>Responsibility for maintenance of this Medical Register lies with the Medical Council. The Supervised Division was established in 2011 by amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to enable the Health Service Executive (HSE) to recruit doctors to practise under supervision for a fixed term in specialty specific non-consultant hospital doctor posts.  It was established to address a shortage of doctors in the HSE.</p><p>  This amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act requires that doctors registered in the Supervised Division only practise medicine in the post to which they have been proposed by the HSE, while under strict supervisory arrangements, for a period of up to two years.  These assessment and practice arrangements are designed to protect patients.  The amendment was intended to complement and not to replace arrangements already in place for registration of doctors pursuing training in Ireland.  </p><p>  Under the arrangements for registration set out in Part 6 of the Medical Practitioners Act, doctors registered in the Supervised Division, wishing to establish themselves in practice on an ongoing basis outside the supervised, specialty specific posts for which they were initially assessed, may transfer to the General Division or the Trainee Specialist Division.  </p><p>  Once registered in the General Division, practitioners may practise medicine on an ongoing basis in Ireland in any post and without any regulatory limit on scope of practice.  The ability to practice medicine in any post was not assessed in the specialty specific assessment, which was designed for registration in the Supervised Division.  </p><p>  The registration process for entry to the General Division involves an assessment to ensure that the practitioner is fit-to-practise in a diverse range of positions.  For most doctors currently registered in the Supervised Division, this will involve examination by way of the PRES, which is designed to ensure that the doctor demonstrates competence in a general scope of practice, which is consistent with registration in the General Division of the register.  This is a critical and necessary measure to protect the public.  </p><p>  Doctors registered in the Supervised Division may also seek registration in the Trainee Specialist Division provided relevant criteria are met.  These criteria include having access to a recognised training post, holding a document which is deemed equivalent to a certificate of experience, and being successful at the PRES, or being exempted from this exam.</p><p>  The Medical Council is currently working with the HSE to operate an efficient process for doctors seeking transfer from the Supervised Division.  Doctors currently registered in the Supervised Division wishing to transfer registration to the General Division must engage in this process. </p></reply>

The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.   Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  </p><p>  There were 572 intern posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. All 2012 EU graduates from Irish medical schools who sought an intern post here that year and met the HSE eligibility criteria were successful in securing a post. Indeed, to date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of additional posts for some non-EU applicants. </p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. There are 639 intern posts available for the July 2013 intake. This means that the HSE will have approximately 70 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013, compared to July 2012. The Executive remains confident that all EU graduates from the six medical schools in Ireland who have applied for an internship and who meet eligibility qualifications will be allocated a post within the public health service as of July 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-16a.2947.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041600060#WRYY03100"><p>Since the national cochlear implant programme commenced seventeen years ago, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants.  I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.  Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.</p><p>  While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. </p><p>  The HSE has advised that it is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The Beaumont Cochlear Implant Team attended a meeting with the British Cochlear Implant Group in March 2013 to determine best practice in relation to introducing a bilateral cochlear implant programme. The HSE has also engaged the services of Professor Gerry O' Donoghue, University of Nottingham, an international expert on the implementation of cochlear implant programmes who will meet with HSE and Beaumont Hospital representatives in May 2013 to advise on the best evidence-based approaches and methodologies for implementing such a programme. Following this, it is envisaged that a business plan will be developed to identify the requirements for funding and resources required to provide a sustainable and cohesive service. A framework will be provided that clarifies the prioritisation of children waiting for a sequential implant which will be on a fair and equitable basis.

However, in the Irish context, there has been no existing data to establish what that cost might be or the level of need for such a service.  </p><p>  The absence of data for aeromedical support in the Irish context indicated the need for a pilot project, in order to assess the type and extent of service, if any, that might be required to support the National Ambulance Service (NAS).  In cooperation with my colleague Alan Shatter, Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, I decided in March 2012 to carry out an EAS trial.  The trial involves the Irish Air Corps providing aeromedical support to the HSE NAS, from a base in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  The aircraft is operated by the Air Corps, with clinical staffing from the NAS. The objective of the trial is to gather operational data, including costs and clinical outcomes, with a view to agreeing recommendations on the future provision of service. </p><p>  A review of the trial is being carried out by the Emergency Aeromedical Service Audit and Evaluation Group, comprising representatives from the HSE NAS, the Air Corps and the Departments of Health and Defence.  Assessment of the trial will inform future policy direction, and in the event that a decision is made to provide this type of service, how best to proceed operationally.</p></reply>

The Government is also conscious of the position of the Ombudsman that the schemes are illegal in the context of the Equal Status Acts.</p><p>  Following detailed consideration of issues surrounding the Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant, the Government decided in February that it is no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they presently operate and to devise an alternative for meeting people&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>  It is important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the transport needs of relevant people.</p><p>  It is also important to note that despite the fact that both schemes ended for new applicants in February, the payment of the Mobility Allowance to those who are currently in receipt will continue until June as we devise an alternative method of meeting people&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>  A special Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  The work of the Project Group includes a public consultation process, which is currently underway and available on the Department of Health's website www.doh.ie  Any views held by individuals or organisations on this matter can be made known to the Project Group, through this process. The results of the review will be presented to the Government before any final decisions are made on future arrangements. At this stage I am not in a position to pre-empt the outcome of the review or the decision of the Government.</p></reply>

If someone with coeliac disease is exposed to gluten, they may experience a wide range of symptoms and adverse effects, including diarrhoea, bloating, abdominal pain, weight loss and malnutrition.  The cause or causes of coeliac disease are unknown, but it is thought to be associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p><p><b>Prevalence</b></p><p>During the 1980s, before advances in testing for coeliac disease were made, the condition was mistakenly thought to be rare.</p><p>Coeliac disease is now recognised to be a common condition that is thought to affect approximately 1 in every 100 people. Women are two to three times more likely to develop coeliac disease than men. Cases of coeliac disease have been diagnosed in people of all ages.</p><p>In some cases, coeliac disease does not cause any noticeable symptoms, or it causes very mild symptoms. As a result, it is thought that at least 50% or possibly as many as 90% of cases are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as other digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Department of Health does not have information about the clinical and cost implications of undiagnosed cases.  Data on the prevalence of coeliac disease in Ireland are not routinely available since it is not a condition covered either by statutory notification nor at present included in any disease registers.</p><p>Information on discharges from publicly-funded acute hospitals is collected via the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) system which records diagnoses and procedures for each in-patient and day case.  Patients with a principal diagnosis of coeliac disease can be identified and the attached Table displays the results for the period 2007 to 2011 by HSE region of residence and age group.  The data shows an increase in discharges with this diagnosis over the period, particularly in the 0-14 age group. In the absence of prevalence data it is not possible to identify whether this increase indicates an increase in the disease or a change in diagnostic practice. It must be emphasised that the data refer only to hospitalised cases and that if a person is admitted more than once during the year for a specific condition each admission is counted separately in HIPE.  For these reasons, the figures cannot be interpreted as an estimate of the prevalence of coeliac disease within the community.</p><p><b>Hospitalisations with a Principal Diagnosis of Coeliac Disease by HSE Region of Residence and Age, 2007 - 2011</b></p><p><table><tr><th>HSE Region of Residence</th><th>Age Group</th><th><div>2007</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>0-14 Years</td><td><div>29</div></td><td><div>39</div></td><td><div>39</div></td><td><div>41</div></td><td><div>67</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15-44 Years</td><td><div>74</div></td><td><div>101</div></td><td><div>83</div></td><td><div>70</div></td><td><div>74</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Mid-Leinster</td><td>45-64 Years</td><td><div>77</div></td><td><div>73</div></td><td><div>71</div></td><td><div>69</div></td><td><div>49</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>65+ Years</td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>41</div></td><td><div>28</div></td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All Ages</td><td><div>214</div></td><td><div>254</div></td><td><div>221</div></td><td><div>220</div></td><td><div>228</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0-14 Years</td><td><div>22</div></td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>22</div></td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>37</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15-44 Years</td><td><div>38</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>53</div></td><td><div>49</div></td><td><div>50</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North-East</td><td>45-64 Years</td><td><div>36</div></td><td><div>39</div></td><td><div>39</div></td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>39</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>65+ Years</td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All Ages</td><td><div>111</div></td><td><div>125</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>130</div></td><td><div>147</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0-14 Years</td><td><div>27</div></td><td><div>28</div></td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>41</div></td><td><div>58</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15-44 Years</td><td><div>89</div></td><td><div>69</div></td><td><div>57</div></td><td><div>93</div></td><td><div>71</div></td></tr><tr><td>South</td><td>45-64 Years</td><td><div>89</div></td><td><div>57</div></td><td><div>63</div></td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>64</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>65+ Years</td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>37</div></td><td><div>50</div></td><td><div>47</div></td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All Ages</td><td><div>245</div></td><td><div>191</div></td><td><div>194</div></td><td><div>257</div></td><td><div>212</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0-14 Years</td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>23</div></td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>44</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15-44 Years</td><td><div>46</div></td><td><div>49</div></td><td><div>86</div></td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>88</div></td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>45-64 Years</td><td><div>52</div></td><td><div>64</div></td><td><div>58</div></td><td><div>72</div></td><td><div>72</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>65+ Years</td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>38</div></td><td><div>31</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All Ages</td><td><div>152</div></td><td><div>162</div></td><td><div>200</div></td><td><div>216</div></td><td><div>235</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0-14 Years</td><td><div>108</div></td><td><div>116</div></td><td><div>111</div></td><td><div>129</div></td><td><div>206</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15-44 Years</td><td><div>247</div></td><td><div>262</div></td><td><div>279</div></td><td><div>288</div></td><td><div>283</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>45-64 Years</td><td><div>254</div></td><td><div>233</div></td><td><div>231</div></td><td><div>265</div></td><td><div>224</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>65+ Years</td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>121</div></td><td><div>121</div></td><td><div>141</div></td><td><div>109</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All Ages</td><td><div>722</div></td><td><div>732</div></td><td><div>742</div></td><td><div>823</div></td><td><div>822</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Source: Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Notes: </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>The data reported above refer to inpatients and daycases with a principal diagnosis of Coeliac Disease (ICD-10-AM K90.0). Approximately 16% of the discharges reported above were re-admissions to the same hospital following a previous admission.</p><p><b>Treatment</b></p><p>Coeliac disease is usually treated by simply excluding foods that contain gluten from the diet. This prevents damage to the lining of the intestines (gut) that is caused by gluten, and the associated symptoms, such as diarrhoea and stomach pain. Many basic food items do not contain gluten and a wide range of gluten free alternatives to foods containing wheat, barley and rye is available in supermarkets and pharmacies.</p><p>Patients with coeliac disease can receive help and advice from their General Practitioner about dietary management and should also be referred for dietetic advice to ensure that the diet is balanced and contains all the nutrients needed, including essential vitamins and minerals.</p><p>In relation to the level of support available on the General Medical service for patients with coeliac disease, eligibility for health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.  The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE) are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to persons and themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded.</p><p>Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services. They are also entitled to prescribed drugs and medicines subject to a &euro;1.50 charge per prescribed item (maximum charge of &euro;19.50 per month).  Other services such as allied health professional services may be available to medical card holders.</p><p>People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultants services.  The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;75 per night, to a maximum of &euro;750 in any twelve consecutive months.  Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;100 where the patient does not have a referral note from his/her doctor.  This charge applies only to the first episode of care. Under the Drug Payment Schemes, no individual or family in this category pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>In the current financial environment the Health Service Executive (HSE) faces a continuing challenge to deliver services in a way that will minimise any adverse impact on patients and continue to protect, as far as possible, the most vulnerable citizens.  Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  This includes gluten-free products.</p><p>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: <i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/swa9.pdf</i>  .  Separate application forms are available for children.  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p><p><b>Screening</b></p><p>Screening for coeliac disease involves a two stage process:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">blood tests to help identify people who may have coeliac disease</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">gut biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.</div></p><p>Routine screening for coeliac disease is not recommended unless a patient has symptoms associated with the condition or pre-existing risk factors.</p><p>In 2009, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance about when testing for coeliac disease should be carried out.  Information about the NICE guidance is available on the HSE website.</p><p><i>http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/flu/A-Z/C/Coeliac-disease/Diagnosing-coeliac-disease.html</i></p><p>The NICE guidance identifies the signs or symptoms for which testing for coeliac disease is strongly recommended for adults or children. The guidance also identifies a number of disease conditions in which testing for coeliac disease is or may be recommended.</p><p>In addition, I have arranged to have the Deputy's specific questions in relation to access to screening and access to dietetics referred to the HSE for attention and a more detailed response.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  For the first time data are available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment. </p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. </p><p>  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Approximately 20 will be offered to the market subject to a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres and b) site suitability and availability.   The HSE is currently finalising matters relating to the available sites and GP engagement in each location.  The HSE is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) as required to progress Primary Care Centre Public Private Partnership.  The NDFA as a centre of expertise will be responsible for the delivery of the Primary Care PPP programme on behalf of the HSE, including the management of the procurement phase and the provision of financial advice including a Value for Money assessment.   It has been reviewing the processes involved in procurement of PPP projects with a view to streamlining the process and delivering projects more quickly.  The preparatory work which precedes signing of any PPP agreement is well underway.</p><p>  Public Private Partnership  (PPP) involves a large element of up-front funding by the private sector and allows the cost of financing infrastructure to be spread over the lifetime of the asset.  PPPs are reimbursed through annual unitary payments. As unitary payments are linked to performance over the lifetime of the project payments will only be made where the asset is delivered in line with the terms of the contract.  While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.  Therefore it is estimated that the HSE is unlikely to make annual unitary payments before late 2016.</p></reply>

The HSE also recognise the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes and communities in accordance with Government policy. Home helps play a vital role in enabling people to continue to live at home and this policy will continue to be a key feature of health service delivery. The Government will make every effort, despite significant resource pressures, to protect front-line home support services for vulnerable older people and to facilitate the development of the home help service.  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning home help contracts.  The Court issued a further recommendation on 12 December 2012 noting that management proposals to deal with the issues raised would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services. The parties have since met on a number of occasions and significant progress has been made.  A further meeting is taking place today at the Labour Relations Commission.</p></reply>

The handling, processing, storage, etc, of human tissue, including gametes  (eggs and sperm) and embryos, is currently regulated under the <i>European Communities (Quality and Safety of Human Tissues and Cells) Regulations (Statutory Instrument No.158 of 2006</i>) which came into law on 7 April, 2006.  The Regulations apply to tissues establishments involved in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells intended for human applications.  The aim of the Regulations is to ensure a high level of protection of human health. The Regulations include criteria for assessing the status of prospective donors, inspection and control measures, traceability of donations and qualifications and training for persons working in tissue establishments.</p><p>  Fertility clinics are tissue establishments under the Regulations and thus, they must be inspected and authorised by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), which is the competent authority under the Regulations, to ensure that they meet quality and safety standards.  The Medical Council provides specific guidance in the area of AHR in the ethical guidelines issued periodically to registered medical practitioners for application in the clinical situations in which they work. However<font color="#0000FF">,</font> these Guidelines have no statutory remit and do not apply to anyone working in the area other than medical practitioners.  Section B (20.1-20.4) of the 7th Edition of the Medical Council Guidelines provides as follows:</p><p>  - 20.1 Assisted human reproduction treatments, such as In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), should only be used after thorough investigation has shown that no other treatment is likely to be effective. You should ensure that appropriate counselling has been offered to the patient and that the patient has given informed consent before receiving any treatment.</p><p>  - 20.2 Assisted reproduction services should only be provided by suitably qualified professionals, in appropriate facilities, and according to international best practice.  Regular clinical audit and follow-up of outcomes should be the norm.</p><p>  - 20.3 If you offer donor programmes to patients, you must consider the biological difficulties involved and pay particular attention to the source of the donated material. Such donations should be altruistic and non-commercial. You should keep accurate records for future reference.</p><p>  - 20.4 You should not participate in creating new forms of life solely for experimental purposes. You should not engage in human reproductive cloning.</p><p>  I am currently considering policy proposals to further regulate Assisted Human Reproduction and related matters.</p></reply>

The Government is also conscious of the position of the Ombudsman that the schemes are illegal in the context of the Equal Status Acts.</p><p>  Following detailed consideration of issues surrounding the Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant, the Government decided in February that it is no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they presently operate and to devise an alternative for meeting people&rsquo;s needs.  It is important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the transport needs of relevant people.  It is also important to note that despite the fact that both schemes ended for new applicants in February, the payment of the Mobility Allowance to those who are currently in receipt will continue until June as we devise an alternative method of meeting people&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>  A special Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  The work of the Project Group includes a public consultation process, which is currently underway and available on the Department of Health's website www.doh.ie  Any views held by individuals or organisations on this matter can be made known to the Project Group, through this process. The results of the review will be presented to the Government before any final decisions are made on future arrangements. At this stage I am not in a position to pre-empt the outcome of the review or the decision of the Government.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Revenue Commissioners' Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme is unaffected by the Government Decision in relation to the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes.  Under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme, a family member of a disabled passenger can qualify for tax relief linked to the purchase of vehicles, provided he/she is living with and is responsible for the transport of the disabled person in question, has acquired the vehicle for that purpose and the disabled passenger is the holder of a Primary Medical Certificate.  Applications for Primary Medical Certificates are processed by the HSE through local health offices.</p></reply>

This funding is being used for the further development of forensic services and community mental health teams for adults, children and older persons and for mental health intellectual disability, and to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention.  </p><p>  Funding for suicide prevention is provided to the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) by the HSE from its overall budget for mental health.  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &#8364;13 million.  Over &#8364;8 million of this is provided to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.  This includes an additional &#8364;1 million from the &#8364;35 million allocation for 2013 (above).  The remaining &#8364;5 million for suicide prevention is available regionally to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.</p><p>  The NOSP is reviewing its current activities to make the  most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  This will result in a revised strategic approach for 2013 and will inform the final phase of <i>Reach Out,</i>  our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention which runs until 2014.  I expect that the HSE will approve the revised approach in the very near future.  This reviewed approach will build on progress made to date, which includes the provision of awareness and training programmes such as safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), National Mental Health Awareness Campaigns as well as the Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health &amp; Suicide Prevention which were jointly developed with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The Bill passed Committee Stage in the House on the 19th of March and Report Stage is scheduled for the 23rd of April. I hope that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses shortly thereafter.  The key aim of the legislation is to ensure value for money in the supply of medicines; therefore, the medicines that will be reviewed first are most costly to patients and the Exchequer. </p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has been asked by the Department of Health to prioritise consideration of the classes of medicines that give rise to the greatest costs.  Twenty of these medicines have been identified.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.  The drugs involved are: Atorvastatin, Anastrazole, Candesartan, Clopidogrel, Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole, Lercanidipine, Losartan, Olanzapine, Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, Perindopril, Pravastatin, Quetiapine, Rabeprazole, Ramipril, Risperidone, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin and Valsartan. </p><p>  As soon as the legislation is commenced, the IMB will begin compiling Lists of Interchangeable Medicines. As required by the legislation, Marketing Authorisation Holders will be consulted on the proposed groups of interchangeable medicines and will have 28 days to comment.  It is anticipated that the first List of Interchangeable Medicines will be published on the IMB website within 2-3 months of the commencement of the legislation.  It is my intention that the review of the first 20 medicines will be completed as soon as possible, subject to compliance with the strict timelines set out in the legislation.       </p><p>  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.  The Department is committed to establishing high-level annual targets by the end of September for the share of generic penetration over the medium-term. These targets will be informed by the findings of a report currently being completed by the ESRI which is examining the usage of generics in Ireland and comparable EU jurisdictions. </p><p>  The Health Information Bill, which is expected  be ready for publication later this year, will deal, in conjunction with the Data Protection Acts, with the governance and use of health information so as to improve patient care and safety and to facilitate the achievement of wider health service goals.</p></reply>

It aims to provide a framework for sustainable intervention to prevent and effectively respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and is lead by Cosc which is the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The HSE subsequently published its own Policy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The principal actions are in line with the National Strategy.  The HSE&rsquo;s policy states that a health-focused analysis of violence is crucial, not only because the consequences of such violence require a significant amount of healthcare system resources, but most importantly because the health care system is often the first route through which victims seek to access supports.</p><p>  Nationally the HSE funds 42 frontline domestic violence service providers.  20 of these provide refuge accommodation and this number has risen from 15 since 2000.  The services provide a wide range of supports such as crisis refuge, advocacy and counselling and were funded to the amount of &euro;13.465M in 2012.

At present, patients who require this treatment are referred to neurosurgical centres outside of Ireland (primarily the UK) for surgery and follow-up care, with funding being provided through the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS). The purpose of this HTA was to compare this method of service delivery to that of a proposed national DBS service in Ireland. The Health Information and Quality Authority published the results of the HTA  of a national deep brain stimulation (DBS) programme for adults with movement disorders in November 2012.</p><p>  The Authority&rsquo;s assessment found that the cost of a national DBS programme in Ireland would exceed the cost of continuing to fund DBS through the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) by approximately &euro;21,000 per patient over 10 years. Over five years, the incremental budget impact of a national DBS service would be &euro;1.84 million more than the estimated &euro;4.29 million required to treat the same number of patients through the TAS.  I have not received a proposal from the HSE in relation to the development a cross border brain stimulation service.

In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged to ensure that a person&rsquo;s eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to the medical card schemes is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement.  The HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in the making of reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing an applicant for the General Medical Services scheme.  These guidelines are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HSE's medical card website. </p><p>  The standard procedure for the review of medical cards for persons aged 66 years or older is that their medical card will be reviewed every 4 years. For persons under the age of 66 years, the length of validity of a medical card is 3 years.  Depending on the individual's circumstances, it may be issued for a shorter period. If an individual's circumstances change, he/she must inform the HSE, as he/she may no longer be eligible.  In addition to the standard assessment and review processes, random audits of eligibility will also be undertaken by the HSE on an on-going basis. If selected for review under this process, the Medical Card holder will be informed and requested to submit up to date income details.</p><p>  Any medical card holder undergoing a review to renew a medical card, who genuinely engages with the HSE in that review, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, they retain their medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided.</p></reply>

However, people attending outpatient and hospital appointments are, in general, expected to make their own travel arrangements, using private or scheduled public transport. The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients, where transport may be provided.  In these cases, the patient's appointment or treatment should be directly related to the treatment.  Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher. </p><p>  Following implementation of the HSE's non-ambulance patient transport policy, responsibility for the arrangement and provision of non-ambulance transport has moved from the HSE National Ambulance Service to local health offices in each region.  For non-emergency transfers of patients between hospitals, where these transfers are stretcher-based or otherwise clinically indicated, the new intermediate care service (ICS), is being progressively rolled out. The ICS currently serves Cavan, Castleblayney, South County Dublin, Letterkenny, Sligo, Galway, Roscommon, Limerick, Mallow and Bantry.  Supported by the National Service Plan, it is expected to be expanded in 2013, including Cork and Tralee. In addition to the ICS, the HSE has a framework agreement with private providers for the provision of non-emergency transfers.  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Enamel fluorosis has been monitored in Ireland since 1984. This is regarded as an accurate method of monitoring total fluoride intake, using increasingly sophisticated new technologies. Surveys to measure the effectiveness of water fluoridation on children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; oral health include national studies in 1984, 1990, 2001 and 2002, regional studies between 1990 and 1999 and a cross border study in 2006. All of these studies showed a substantial benefit of fluoridation in terms of a reduction in tooth decay.  </p><p>  A high level advisory group to provide technical and academic oversight of a planned bio-monitoring study of total fluoride intake in Ireland was established by the Department of Health and the HSE in 2012. The group advised that, due to its inherent limitations, such a study utilising samples of urine or nails, on its own, would not be beneficial. It proposed that consideration be given to an assessment of fluorosis as a bio-marker in an oral health study. The Health Research Board has approved funding for a study by the Oral Health Services Research Centre of University College Cork. The Department of Health is a collaborator in the study. The study 'What Impact Have Major Policy Changes Had on Oral Health in Ireland? Establishing a Blueprint for Oral Health Surveillance' will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children (2002) and the reduced level of fluoridation in drinking water (2007).</p></reply>

Arrangements are now being made within the HSE to coordinate the necessary documentation for submission to its National Recruitment Service (NRS) to proceed with the filling of the posts.  The NRS has confirmed that panels are in place for the above grades and they will be in a position to proceed to offer the posts once all the necessary documentation is received.  The expectation is that appointments will be made as soon as possible thereafter.  Any savings which arise as as result of delays in recruiting the above staff will be used to offset expenditure pressures within the primary care area which may arise during this year.</p></reply>

The overarching aim of the NAP is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is improved management of people with asthma in primary care and, thereby, avoiding attendances at emergency departments and hospital admissions.  The target is to reduce bed days  for acute asthma by 10% per year over 3 years through implementing the programme&#8217;s asthma guidelines and national model of care.  In the first year of programme, there was an 8% reduction in acute hospital bed days.  </p><p>  The initial focus of the work of the NAP has been on the development and implementation of national asthma guidelines.  The National Model of Care for Asthma will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless experience within the health system.  This includes a model for the management of asthma in primary care and the necessary links with specialist hospital services.  The National Model of Care will document the care that should be provided for a patient with asthma in both primary and secondary care and is a key deliverable for the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  85% of asthma is managed in primary care, which is in line with the Government's policy of providing care as close as possible to the patient's home.</p><p>  Adult Emergency Asthma Guidelines were published in November 2011 and are available online at .  These guidelines are being revised at present and will be submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC).  Paediatric Emergency Asthma Guidelines have also been developed and will be available for circulation shortly.  Guidelines for managing a patient with asthma in primary care have recently been approved by the Irish College of General Practitioners and are currently being circulated.</p><p>  A self-learning asthma e-learning 6 modular theoretical programme, based on the national evidenced based guidelines and developed by NAP in conjunction with the Asthma Society of Ireland is available online at <i></i>and   This will enable healthcare professionals to underpin their skill sets with theory.  There is also a similar programme available for GPs on the ICGP website.  In addition, a practical workshop is also being delivered by Respiratory Clinical Nurse Specialists for staff in Primary Care and hospitals.  This education programme will continue throughout 2013.</p></reply>

The Supervised Division was established in 2011 by amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to enable the Health Service Executive (HSE) to recruit doctors to practise under supervision for a fixed term in specialty specific, non-consultant hospital doctor posts.  It was established to address a shortage of doctors in the HSE.</p><p>  This amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act requires that doctors registered in the Supervised Division only practise medicine in the post to which they have been proposed by the HSE, while under strict supervisory arrangements, for a period of up to two years.  These assessment and practice arrangements are designed to protect patients.  The amendment was intended to complement and not to replace arrangements already in place for registration of doctors pursuing training in Ireland.  </p><p>  Under the arrangements for registration set out in Part 6 of the Medical Practitioners Act, doctors registered in the Supervised Division, wishing to establish themselves in practice on an ongoing basis outside the supervised, specialty specific posts for which they were initially assessed, may transfer to the General Division or the Trainee Specialist Division.  </p><p>  Once registered in the General Division, practitioners may practise medicine on an ongoing basis in Ireland in any post and without any regulatory limit on scope of practice.  The ability to practice medicine in any post was not assessed in the specialty specific assessment, which was designed for registration in the Supervised Division.  </p><p>  The registration process for entry to the General Division involves an assessment to ensure that the practitioner is fit-to-practise in a diverse range of positions.  For most doctors currently registered in the Supervised Division, this will involve examination by way of the PRES, which is designed to ensure that the doctor demonstrates competence in a general scope of practice, which is consistent with registration in the General Division of the register.  This is a critical and necessary measure to protect the public.  </p><p>  Doctors registered in the Supervised Division may also seek registration in the Trainee Specialist Division provided relevant criteria are met.  These criteria include having access to a recognised training post, holding a document which is deemed equivalent to a certificate of experience, and being successful at the PRES, or being exempted from this exam.</p><p>  The Medical Council is currently working with the HSE to operate an efficient process for doctors seeking transfer from the Supervised Division.  Doctors currently registered in the Supervised Division wishing to transfer registration to the General Division must engage in this process.</p></reply>

Approximately 90% of mental health problems are dealt with in primary care and some 30% of people who attend primary care have a mental health problem.

It may be implemented in many ways, but the essence of individualised budgeting is that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised. This approach must be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated. </p><p>  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Review. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure their long-term viability.</p></reply>

The Team now includes a representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides disabled individuals with an entitlement to an independent assessment of need and a statement of proposed services to be provided, and allows them to pursue a complaint and, if necessary, make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer. Part 2 of the Act was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children under the age of five. It had been intended to have both the Disability Act 2005 and the EPSEN Act 2004 fully implemented during 2010 for children and young people aged up to 18. However, in 2008 the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of both Acts. Notwithstanding this the Cross-Sectoral Team continues to meet to address issues of mutual concern for children with disabilities. </p></reply>

Approximately 20 will be offered to the market subject to a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres and b) site suitability and availability.   The HSE is currently finalising matters relating to the available sites and GP engagement in each location.  The HSE is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) as required to progress Primary Care Centre Public Private Partnership.  The NDFA as a centre of expertise will be responsible for the delivery of the Primary Care PPP programme on behalf of the HSE, including the management of the procurement phase and the provision of financial advice including a Value for Money assessment.   It has been reviewing the processes involved in procurement of PPP projects with a view to streamlining the process and delivering projects more quickly.  The preparatory work for the primary care centre project which precedes signing of any PPP agreements is well underway.   While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016. </p></reply>

In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).

The Disability Appeals Officer (DAO) is an independent officer appointed by the Minister for Health whose purpose is to provide an appeals service to people who wish to appeal (i) against a finding or recommendation of a complaints officer of the HSE made under the Disability Act 2005; or (ii) against the failure of the HSE or an education service provider to implement a recommendation of a complaints officer. </p><p>  The Office of the Disability Appeals Officer (ODAO) was created to support the DAO in the performance of his/her functions.  It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body.  Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act.  From 2007, staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.</p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and, by 2011, there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position.  This remains the position.</p><p>  The existing Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31st December 2011 and my Department has had discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. </p><p>  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the Disability Appeals Officer and is independent in the performance of this function.  A longer term arrangement is being considered. </p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act.  As part of its service, the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line.  The Lo-Call line is monitored during normal business hours Monday- Friday.</p></reply>

In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged to ensure that a person&rsquo;s eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to the medical card schemes is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement.  The HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in the making of reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing an applicant for the General Medical Services scheme.  These guidelines are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HSE's medical card website.  </p><p>The standard procedure for the review of medical cards for persons aged 66 years or older is that their medical card will be reviewed every 4 years. For persons under the age of 66 years, the length of validity of a medical card is 3 years.  Depending on the individual's circumstances, it may be issued for a shorter period. If an individual's circumstances change, he/she must inform the HSE, as he/she may no longer be eligible.   In addition to the standard assessment and review processes, random audits of eligibility will also be undertaken by the HSE on an on-going basis. If selected for review under this process, the Medical Card holder will be informed and requested to submit up to date income details. </p><p>  Any medical card holder undergoing a review to renew a medical card, who genuinely engages with the HSE in that review, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, he/she retains the medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy  in relation to Ms Farrell's review as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In a time of very limited recruitment opportunities in the public sector, this initiative is offering up to 1,000 graduate nurses and midwives two- year contracts in the public health services. Participants will be recruited on two-year contracts and will be paid 80% of the starting-point of the Staff Nurse Scale. They will also qualify for premium payments and allowances on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, bringing expected average pay to about &#8364;25,000 per year, excluding overtime. The employment of Graduates in a specific graduate scheme is a widespread practice in other sectors of the economy.  The rate of pay under this initiative is within the norms for such programmes.  </p><p>  The scheme will support the retention of graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation. It offers graduates an opportunity for further professional development. Participants will be supported to complete a Certificate in Advanced Healthcare Skills, such as Health Assessment and Pharmacology. The graduate nurses and midwives will be able to avail of the suite of educational programmes provided by the Centres for Nursing and Midwifery to enhance their professional development including intravenous canulation and anaphylaxis training. These skills are aligned to the delivery of the HSE clinical care programmes supporting earlier access to assessments and treatments for patients. This programme of professional development will be of great value for individual nurses as they embark on their career path.</p><p>  Applications from graduates under this scheme will continue to be accepted by the HSE.  In line with normal practice, the HSE will continue to facilitate applicants with offers of appointment to posts in the part of the country for which they have expressed a preference.</p></reply>

However, the provision of modern, high quality, safe care requires increasing levels of cooperation and overarching systems of governance and communication. We know that the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  Experience in Ireland and abroad teaches us that a co-ordinated system of care is clearly better for patients than a sporadic approach from hospital to hospital.   The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  </p><p>  It was with this in mind that I appointed Professor John Higgins in June of last year to chair a Strategic Board on the establishment of Hospital Groups. I have received Professor Higgins&rsquo; report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the Strategic Board.  I will shortly submit this report to Government, to consider and decide on the final formation of each hospital group.  I appreciate that this report and the related  government decision are anxiously awaited: however, this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the State&rsquo;s foundation and I take very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely, to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it. </p><p>  The Government will decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. </p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. </p><p>  In moving to UHI, the Government is not seeking to simply transplant a health system from another jurisdiction.  While it is important to learn from international experience, we are committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance which best fits the Irish system.  Detailed design work is currently ongoing on the model of UHI for Ireland.  This work includes explicit consideration of mechanisms for ensuring appropriate cost control and long-term sustainability of our health system. </p><p>  Finally, a number of initiatives are currently underway in order to prepare the system for the introduction of UHI. These initiatives will bring benefits and drive efficiencies in advance of implementing universal health insurance. They include: </p><p>-  the strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients,</p><p>-  the work of the Special Delivery Unit in tackling waiting times and establishing hospital groups, </p><p>-  the introduction of a more transparent and efficient &quot;Money Follows the Patient&quot; funding mechanism for hospitals, and,</p><p>-  the establishment of a Consultative Forum on Health Insurance comprising representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  The Forum provides a  platform for identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. In addition, it gives a voice to insurers in raising issues relating to the development of UHI.   </p></reply>

Additionally, &euro;31,032.50 of Free Travel Pass (FTP) funding has been allocated to WCRT from January to June 2013, with a further proposed allocation of &euro;31,032 from July to December 2013. This represents a total 2013 allocation of combined RTP and FTP funding of &euro;322,262.50 for the provision of RTP services in West Cork. </p><p>  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making  the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. </p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding West Cork or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.   </p></reply>

The position is unchanged.<blockquote>D&aacute;il Question  <b>No: 4</b>  To ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport his plans to supply the public transport passenger with a more diverse bus service provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.<br /><br />- Timmy Dooley.<br /><br />For PRIORITY answer on Wednesday, 27th March, 2013.<br /><br /><b>Ref No: </b>  15509/13 <br /><br />Answered by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Leo Varadkar<br /><br /><br /><br />REPLY<br /><br />This question relates to the structure of the public service obligation bus market.  The programme for Government contains a commitment &quot;to establish a Cabinet Sub-Committee on Infrastructure to explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of a more diverse bus service provision&quot;.  In line with this commitment, the National Transport Authority conducted a non-statutory public consultation in the summer of 2012.  A report on the process is available on the website of the authority.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the Competition Authority's submission, which highlighted the positive international experience of tendering.  The National Transport Authority briefed the Cabinet sub-committee on the process in October 2012.  Public consultation submissions will be considered and taken into account by the authority when it comes forward with proposals.  If the authority proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services, it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Furthermore, the legislation states that it may not enter into direct award contracts unless &quot;it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts&quot;.  Accordingly, the matter will require further examination by the National Transport Authority before any decisions are taken.  I have been advised by the authority that it is commencing a series of analytical tasks in respect of the public service obligation bus market.  This analytical work will be completed before August of this year, when the authority anticipates that statutory consultation on any new direct award contract will need to commence.</blockquote></p></reply>

The new licensing system involves three outsourced contracts, managed by a specialist unit based in RSA headquarters in Ballina.  The outsourced elements are: a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer, and a back office to process applications.  This system will not be fully up and running until September of this year.  In the meantime, local authorities continue to perform front office functions on behalf of the RSA.  The Deputy may wish to note that, during this transition period, applicants can still provide their photos as before.  Once the new system is fully operational, the only option will be the digital photo taken at the front office network.  I understand from the RSA that when they published the Request for Tenders for the front office they asked tenderers to put forward a preference for scanning or digital capture.  All three tenderers went for digital capture, as it is the most effective, secure and efficient process.  The operation of the tender processes was a matter for the RSA, and I had no involvement in it.  The contractors for the front office, and the back office and card producer, have already been procured.</p></reply>

Neither makes any reference to organ donation.  One of the main purposes of the new EU licence is to provide harmonisation in the level of information in all Member States.  The EU Directives provide for a series of number codes that Member States may include on the new licence format for various forms of information.  Member States have the option of including additional information besides that required by the Directives.  The use of number codes is a standard form of conveying information under the Directives, with codes from 100 upwards available to be used for such optional addition information as individual member states choose to require.  Ireland has chosen to make an indication of willingness to be an organ donor available as an option, and this is therefore indicated by a number code.  This replaces the option on the old paper licence, which had a box in which a licence holder could write indicating if they wished to be an organ donor.</p></reply>

The current contract represents a competitive price for a highly professional and reliable life saving service. It represents a stepped improvement in the capacity, range, speed and capability of Ireland's SAR service and enhanced support for the national ambulance service.  The new helicopters being deployed allow for staying on scene longer, searching using improved radar, night lighting and infra-red and have the ability to fly in cloud and reduced visibility.  They have better hover performance, a sophisticated mission planning and tracking systems and the crew have better medical qualifications.  All of this represents a significant enhancement on the previous helicopter SAR arrangements.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.</p><p>   The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.</p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will be working with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.</p></reply>

Under the first phase of the funding programme, Limerick County Council was provided &euro;290,000 in 2012 towards the cost of delivering part of the Great Southern Trail from Abbeyfeale to Kilmorna.  As this phase of the programme will expire at the end of 2013, it is my intention to initiate a new funding call later this year to provide, through competitive process, a further tranche of funding for the remainder of the years to 2016.  Developing further and completing the cycleway route in question is now principally a matter for Kerry County Council.  Any plans to develop the remaining part of the route progressed by  Kerry County Council could be submitted to the Department under the next phase of the NCN funding programme, once initiated, although it should be noted that requests for funding are likely to significantly exceed the funds available and it is possible that only a small proportion of the projects seeking funding will be supported.</p></reply>
