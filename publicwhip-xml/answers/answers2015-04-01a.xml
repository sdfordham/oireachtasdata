    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-01a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015040100057#WRA00800"><p>As I have previously advised this House, confronting tax evasion in all its guises, including the use of offshore accounts for that purpose, is a priority for the Revenue Commissioners.  They have been to the forefront internationally in addressing evasion using offshore accounts and other mechanisms, and a series of special investigations that they have undertaken in this field has yielded in excess of &euro;2.7 billion in tax, interest and penalties. Action against offshore accounts specifically had yielded more than &euro;1 billion by the end of 2014.</p>  <p>  In the case of HSBC Bank, Geneva, the Revenue Commissioners became aware in 2010 of newspaper reports that the French authorities had come into possession of information in relation to accounts held with that Bank. Revenue wrote to the French authorities enquiring as to whether the data obtained by them contained information relating to Irish residents, and whether the French authorities would consider disclosing any such information to Revenue. The French authorities responded positively and made a disclosure to Revenue on 23 June 2010.</p>  <p>  The information received was evaluated carefully by Revenue and it was found, for a variety of reasons, that there was no basis for pursuing an investigation in many cases.  The reasons included the absence of Irish addresses on certain accounts, persons associated with the accounts not being resident or domiciled in the State and Revenue establishing that, by reason of prior disclosure, that there was no tax liability. In the case of corporate entities, many were found to have been Irish-registered but non-resident for tax purposes. The vast majority of the funds linked to Ireland in the HSBC data were related to the Funds industry: more than 98 of the total related to the Global Funds sector.</p>  <p>  Following the evaluation of the information, Revenue initiated thirty three investigations. In eight of these, it was determined that there were no additional tax liabilities. Nineteen investigations resulted in settlement payments of over &euro;4.5 million, and a further amount of over &euro;172,000 has been received, as payment on account in relation to two appeals against tax assessments that were entered following investigations into the account holders. Six investigations are ongoing.</p>  <p>  In addition to pursuing taxes owed, Revenue have also sought to have criminal proceedings brought in any cases where the information provided by the French authorities, and their own subsequent investigations, suggested that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute in respect of identified tax offences. Three convictions have been secured, resulting in the imposition of fines ranging from &euro;4,000 to &euro;25,000, and a further case remains under investigation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 2010 mentions the mutual assistance request made to, and the subsequent receipt of information from, a Treaty partner, which provided details of accounts held in Switzerland held by Irish residents. I understand also that the matter was raised when the then Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the Public Accounts Committee in 2011. A comprehensive report on the matter was submitted to the PAC in February 2015, and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the PAC on 12 March 2015. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are in close contact with their counterparts in Revenue on  relevant tax matters on an ongoing basis. The Deputy will be aware, however, that there is a longstanding convention that the Minister for Finance does not intervene in matters involving Revenue and individual taxpayers. I would draw his attention to the terms of section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011, which provides for the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions.</p>  <p>  I wish to commend Revenue for the pro-active role it has taken in tackling tax evasion through the use of offshore accounts. I am confident that they will continue to undertake this important work efficiently and effectively, and that they will use all the analytical and investigative  tools and methods at their disposal to extract as much information as possible from both current and any further data that become available to them. I am aware that they intend to carry out a further evaluation of the HSBC Bank data using new analytical technology, to ascertain whether it brings to light any further cases that may warrant investigation. They will also play an active role in developing cooperation between countries to ensure that the scope for the use offshore accounts to escape tax responsibilities is curtailed to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

Domestic demand grew on an annual basis for the first time since 2007.  Both private consumption and investment contributed to this growth. Exports rose by 12.6 per cent annually in 2014.  This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001. Exports are now at an all-time high. Based on data published to date, Ireland was the fastest-growing economy in the EU in 2014.</p>  <p>  Other data released recently have provided room for encouragement. Consumer spending was strong in 2014 with the volume of retail sales up by over 6 per cent when compared with 2013.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up close to 4 per cent in 2014.  This trend has continued into 2015. Headline sales were up 8.2 per cent in February with core sales up 4.5 per cent year-on-year. </p>  <p>  Investment is also growing, with both construction activity and machinery and equipment spending on a rising path.  Recovery in the construction sector continued in February with the Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector recording its eighteenth successive month of expansion. The euro has depreciated considerably on a trade-weighted basis since last summer. This is a positive development for the Irish export sector. </p>  <p>  The improvements in the real economy are being reflected in the labour market. Total employment grew by 1.5 per cent (+29,100) over the year to Q4 2014, marking a ninth successive quarter of employment growth.  This was driven by increases in full-time employment and was broadly-based, with gains recorded in 11 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.  The unemployment rate continues to fall from the peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012, but still remains high at 10.1 per cent in February this year.</p>  <p>  My Department published its latest macroeconomic forecasts in October with Budget 2015 in which GDP is expected to expand by 3.9 per cent in 2015 and 3.4 per cent in 2016. Annual average growth of just over 3 per cent is expected in the following years. Revised forecasts will be published with the Spring Economic Statement next month and these will take into account latest data and developments at that point.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-01a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015040100057#WRA01200"><p>I have initiated a review of the operation of the LPT. The Review will primarily have regard to recent residential property price developments, the overall yield from LPT and the desirability of achieving relative stability in LPT payments. It will also address a number of issues which have arisen in relation to the efficient and effective administration of the LPT, among which is likely to be the matter of the operation of the pyrite exemption provisions. It is intended that the outcome of the Review will be presented to me no later than summer 2015.  </p>  <p>  Resolution of this matter may necessitate a change in the relevant provisions of the LPT legislation and/or the Pyrite Regulations.  If so, I am examining with the Revenue Commissioners the possibilities for applying any changes on an administrative basis, in advance of such legislative changes.</p>  <p>  It is important that any such changes do not go beyond the objectives of providing a temporary exemption for homes with "significant pyritic damage" only.</p>  <p>  Pending any decisions in relation to the statutory provisions, Revenue has an obligation to act in accordance with section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) which requires that an LPT exemption can only apply where the residential property has been assessed and a certificate confirming "significant pyritic damage" has been issued.  This is the only type of certificate that is relevant and a homeowner cannot claim the exemption until it has been issued. Furthermore, the administration of LPT is a matter for Revenue. The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 put the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions on a fully statutory basis. It would not be appropriate for me to instruct Revenue in such circumstances. However, in regard to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, Revenue has confirmed to me that no compliance action has yet started in respect of the outstanding amounts due to ongoing discussions between the LPT team and the person in question.</p>  <p>  LPT operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property. Issues such as the presence of pyrite would be one of the factors that a property owner should take into account in valuing their property.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-01a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015040100057#WRA01400"><p>The impact of gambling addiction is one that every public representative has come across in the course of their work.  The recently enacted Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 was a first step in providing protection for vulnerable people through the supervision of operators offering remote betting services in this jurisdiction. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act provide that it will be an offence to offer betting services without a licence and provides for the relevant authorities to bring proceedings in these cases. </p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan refers specifically to the extension of opening hours for bookmakers premises included in the Finance Act 2014. These provisions formed part of the above mentioned Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 but were brought forward to the Finance Act 2014 to protect jobs in the industry. The extension of opening hours was provided for to allow the bricks and mortar bookmakers compete with the online sector. This recognised the fact that individuals can bet on line through the medium of mobile phones, PCs and other electronic devices 24 hours a day 7 days a week. As I have already said, the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for the first time a regulation regime for the online sector and ensures that all businesses offering betting services to persons in Ireland are regulated appropriately. With regard to underage gambling it extends to online operators the prohibition on a licensed bookmaker entering into a bet with a person under 18 years of age. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the concerns around gambling addiction and, in particular, underage gambling. The Betting (Amendment) Act was a first step in a move towards the more enhanced regulatory framework being prepared by the Minister for Justice and Equality. In this regard the general scheme of a new comprehensive gambling control legislation was approved by Government in July 2013 and will bring together under one single enactment the regulatory environment for all forms of gambling.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Greek authorities agreed to present a first list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, by 23 February, which they have done. The Institutions have provided a first view on the list of reform measures and stated that the list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. The measures will need to be further specified and then agreed with the Institutions by the end of April.</p>  <p>  On 9 March, the Eurogroup discussed procedural issues relating to the ongoing negotiations to conclude the fifth review of the Greek programme. </p>  <p>  A meeting took place between Prime Minister Tsipras, the Presidents of the European Council, Commission, ECB and Eurogroup, and the leaders of Germany and France en marge of the European Council on 19-20 March, to advance progress on the list of reforms. </p>  <p>  The Greek authorities are currently working with the Institutions on this list of reforms and they will be brought to the Eurogroup in due course.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that the comprehensive list of reform measures and the completion of its requirements will allow for a successful conclusion of the 5th review of the Greek programme and for disbursement of the associated funds. </p>  <p>  In relation to Greek debt, as I have repeatedly outlined, my own view is that Greece should remain in the euro area and that sovereign debt should not be written off. However, there is - of course - some room for manoeuvre in terms of maturity extension and other ways to reduce the burden of debt. This is what we have done in Ireland, in cooperation with our European partners, with the extension of maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans, the replacement of the promissory notes with long-term bonds and the replacement of IMF loans with cheaper market-based funding.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses, and the SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  </p><p>One such policy measure is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, whose goal is to ensure access to flexible funding for Irish SMEs by facilitating the provision of:</p><p>- Flexible products with longer maturity and capital repayment flexibility, subject to credit approval;</p><p>- Lower cost funding to financial institutions which is passed on to SMEs;</p><p>- Market access for new entrants to the SME lending market, creating real competition.</p><p>Each of these elements create a more competitive and dynamic environment for SME funding. The SBCI is a vital new part of the country's financial architecture. By taking a fresh approach to funding SMEs in Ireland, the long-term potential of the sector to drive economic growth and job creation will be actively supported. </p><p>The Central Bank &quot;Retail Interest Rate Statistics: January 2015&quot; shows that the weighted average interest rate on new NFC loans up to &euro;1 million stood at 5.09 per cent at end-January, 210 basis points above the euro area rate.<b></b>However, it should be noted that in the most recent SME credit demand survey covering the six month period to September 2014, only 1% of SMEs that did not demand credit thought that it was too expensive to borrow. In addition, the lower cost funding by the SBCI should act as a catalyst for downward pressure on interest rates by fostering greater competition in the marketplace.</p></reply>

Mortgages are currently subject to the maturity limits contained in section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act, 1997 which sets out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member.</p>  <p>  The Commission on Credit Unions in its Report recommended that some credit unions should be permitted to develop a more sophisticated business model. On 27 November 2014, the Central Bank issued a consultation paper - CP88 - Consultation on Regulations for Credit Union on commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act. This consultation paper contains a number of draft regulations including draft lending regulations. Under these draft lending regulations credit unions can continue to provide mortgages. Existing maturity limits that are currently contained in section 35 of the 1997 Act are included in the draft lending regulations. A maximum maturity limit of 25 years is introduced in the draft regulations.  The draft lending regulations also include a large exposure limit on the maximum exposure a credit union may have to a borrower or a group of borrowers who are connected. The Central Bank will publish a feedback statement taking account of submissions received and propose to introduce the new regulations in December 2015. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has introduced new regulations on residential mortgage lending, under section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 and the Housing Loan Requirements Regulations 2015.  The Regulations, which came into effect on 9 February 2015, apply to mortgage lending by regulated financial services providers (including credit unions) in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Where a credit union is providing mortgage lending, it is vital that a credit union ensurs that it has the appropriate systems, controls and expertise to undertake this type of lending. Also, scale is an important factor in determining whether a credit union can put these processes in place and offer mortgages as a viable business line. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and welcomes any initiatives that might enhance the business model while simultaneously ensuring the protection of members' savings.</p></reply>

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA states that a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the lender has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement under the CCMA with the borrower or his/her nominated representative and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.   </p>  <p>  There is a wide range of advisory services available to borrowers such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). The establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) was also a very significant step in addressing cases of over-indebtedness. The initial take-up of the service was low but this has improved and has shown significant success.  75% of proposals have been supported by creditors.</p>  <p>  The effective management of the mortgage arrears issue is, however, an area that remains under continuous review.  More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, my Department is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.</p></reply>

This review took place, by way of a meeting between officials from my Department and senior management of IBRC, on 11 June 2012. At this meeting, IBRC officials explained how the sale process was conducted, from the selection of the original 50 candidates through to the 8 bids ultimately submitted and the selection of the winning bidder. </p>  <p>  Following this review, a further meeting was held on 25 July 2012, which I attended along with officials from my Department and the Chairman and CEO of IBRC. At this meeting, the transaction referred to in the question was discussed further, along with a number of other topics. I can confirm that at this meeting, it was put to senior management of IBRC that officials in my Department had concerns with a number of decisions taken by IBRC in relation to the sale of SiteServ including the decision to allow the sale process to be led by advisors of SiteServ, the bidding process, entering into exclusivity with one of the bidders and the decision to exclude trade buyers. It was at this meeting that senior management of IBRC confirmed to me that the transaction involving the sale of SiteServ was thoroughly assessed by the Board of IBRC prior to them approving it and that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State. A further meeting between the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, and the then CEO of IBRC took place in August 2012 at which this matter was also further discussed. At that point, the transaction had been concluded and no further action could have been taken. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that a new Relationship Framework had been put in place, it was decided (following the meeting with John Moran and the then CEO of IBRC in August 2012) that a senior Department of Finance official would be seconded to IBRC to explore opportunities for deleveraging with a view to maximising the recovery for the taxpayer. This had the additional benefit of providing greater oversight while supporting the management team. The secondment of Neil Ryan to IBRC commenced shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

Our commitment is to support such countries in raising domestic tax revenues in ways that are more efficient, that promote good governance and equitable development, and that can allow them to eventually exit from a dependence on official development assistance. As part of this commitment, we are currently conducting 'spillover analysis' to research what impact, positive or negative, Ireland's tax system may have on the economies of developing countries; this research is due to be finalised around April 2015.</p>  <p>  A process is also underway at the UN to replace what were known as 'Millennium Development Goals' with a post-2015 menu of 'Sustainable Development Goals' (SDGs). My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is taking the lead in these negotiations; the process includes negotiating a new Global Partnership on "Financing For Development" whereby countries like Ireland will commit to achieving the new SDG's, one of which includes combating illicit financial flows and tax cooperation. Ireland will proactively assist in the development of these "Financing For Development" proposals which will be central to a new framework for global development. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, Ireland proactively combats the inflow of illicit funds from low and middle-income countries by ratifying international anti-money laundering and anticorruption conventions. One example of the sort of measure which seeks to prevent inflows of corrupt monies is in s.37 of the Irish Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 which requires Irish financial services providers to apply enhanced customer due diligence procedures when providing services to foreign politically exposed persons. Furthermore, the latest EU directive in this area, the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive was recently agreed by Ireland and other Member States in January 2015 and the final legal text is due to be published shortly.  We hope to transpose the Directive as soon as possible.</p></reply>

One of which was to develop a framework to govern the exercise of the State's ownership rights in the banks resulting from the capital injections, including to put in place relationship frameworks with the banks to protect the commercial basis for the banks' operations while under State ownership.</p>  <p>  On 30 March 2012, Relationship Frameworks were put in place by my Department with each of the banks in which the State acquired an interest in the context of the financial crisis to govern the relationship between the State, as shareholder, and each bank.  They were designed to recognise the separation of each bank from the State, to ensure their businesses would be run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State , and to limit the State s intervention to the extent necessary to protect the public interest.</p>  <p>  Under the Relationship Frameworks each bank was to remain a separate economic unit with independent power of decision with its board of directors and management team retaining responsibility for determining the bank's strategies and commercial policies and conducting its day-to-day operations.</p>  <p>  A revised Relationship Framework with IBRC was published on March 30, 2012 in line with the introduction of similar agreements for each of the other banks. That followed interaction with the management and Boards of each of the banks concerned.  </p>  <p>  While I confirm that IBRC was consulted on an ongoing basis over a period of months in relation to the introduction of the revised Relationship Framework, the information requested by the Deputy as part of this Parliamentary Question relating to the specific dialogue which took place between my Department and IBRC is currently the subject of a Freedom of Information request and will be released in due course as part of this Freedom of Information request should the Deciding Officer consider its full release to be appropriate.

The draft proposal on the CCCTB does not provide for any harmonisation of corporate tax rates within the EU.

At the moment, the reference rate used in the calculation of the expenditure benchmark is based on a ten year average of potential growth that is updated every three years. The reference rate to apply for 2014 to 2016 was calculated in 2013 when both the outturn and outlook for our economy's growth potential was considerably weaker.  The use of these outdated estimates could lead to inappropriate fiscal decisions being made.   </p>  <p>  On foot of my interventions at political level, my officials have been in discussions at a technical level with the European Commission and other Member States.</p>  <p>  The aim of technical discussions has been to ensure that the methodology for calculating potential output and its implementation in the context of EU fiscal rules is applied in a manner that produces credible results that underpin the operation of a sound set of rules.</p>  <p>  The focus of our discussions has been two pronged: firstly to improve how estimates of potential GDP are calculated for Ireland by using more appropriate population projections and secondly to apply these calculations in a more logical fashion so that the fiscal policy consistent with these rules is set based on latest available information regarding both the outturn and prospects for the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Discussions are progressing well but final decisions at a technical level must be endorsed at the relevant committees. While I do not want to prejudice these ongoing discussions, I want to welcome the strong engagement of the Commission on this issue.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would emphasise that I support the revised fiscal rules.  What I am seeking from the Commission and colleagues from other Member States is a more sensible application of the rules for all Member States as this will enhance the credibility of fiscal policy decision making.</p></reply>

These targets required the six lenders to meet targets at quarterly intervals to both "propose" and "conclude" sustainable solutions in relation to both PDH and BTL mortgagees more than 90 days in arrears.  This strategy had a beneficial impact as the number of mortgage accounts in arrears has declined and the number of restructures put in place to deal with mortgage difficulty has increased.  This is, however, an area that remains under continuous review. More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and as the Taoiseach has previously announced, my Department is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  That said, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and this has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. </p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware of the significant progress which NAMA has made in this respect: up to end-March 2015, it had redeemed &euro;17.6 billion of senior bonds, 58% of the amount originally issued. Its target is to redeem at least &euro;24 billion (80%) by end-2016.  NAMA's progress in this regard has been recognised in Ireland's credit ratings upgrades and is a very important contributory factor to the current very favourable positioning of Ireland in the international bond markets.  NAMA has stated that, on the assumption that conditions in the economy and in the property market continue to remain favourable, it expects to be in a position to repay all of its senior debt by 2017/2018 and to repay  all of its subordinated debt.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware also that, in order to maximise taxpayers' return on its acquired loan portfolio, NAMA advances funding for the development and completion of projects.  NAMA has advanced over &euro;1 billion across a range of commercial, retail, leisure and residential development projects in Ireland to date and has indicated that it expects to advance substantial further funding on a commercial basis to help address current and impending residential and office supply shortages particularly in the Dublin area.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware in this respect that NAMA has committed to funding the delivery of 4,500 new homes in the Dublin area in the three years to end-2016 and facilitating the timely delivery of key Grade A office, retail and residential space in the Dublin Docklands Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) and the wider central business district. NAMA has established dedicated Docklands SDZ and Residential Delivery teams to oversee the funding of these two important projects.  </p>  <p>  In addition to repaying NAMA's debts and advancing development capital to enhance its assets, NAMA uses its cash reserves to meet its on-going funding requirements and operational expenses.  In this context I am advised the NAMA Board considers it will not require additional resources from the Exchequer over its lifetime.  The Deputy will note that, as outlined in the Section 53 Annual Statement, NAMA's operating costs as a percentage of cash generated are less than 3%, which is substantially lower than that of comparable entities internationally where the costs to cash ratio has typically averaged 6%.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Central Bank has indicated that banks subject to the MART process recorded a reduction in the number of accounts in arrears of more than 720 days during the quarter, the first such decline in this category to date.  Similar trends were experienced in the mortgage arrears of more than 90 days category before it peaked in September 2013.  Nevertheless, this is a significant aspect of the mortgage arrears problem that requires continued attention.  With pro-active lender engagement and borrower co-operation, sustainable resolutions or restructures are possible for many mortgages in arrears.  While some borrowers in this cohort may now be in the legal process, it should also be noted that even where legal proceedings have commenced, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears requires a lender to periodically maintain contact with the borrower to see if an alternative repayment arrangement can be agreed.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, even if the case comes before a Court, the 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, gives power to a Court to adjourn possession proceedings in relation to a principal private residence to see if a Personal Insolvency Arrangement could be proposed as an alternative resolution of the matter.</p></reply>

Asset purchases provide monetary stimulus to the economy in a context where key ECB interest rates are effectively at the lower bound. They should further ease monetary and financial conditions. They should also help to support investment and consumption, and ultimately contribute to a return of inflation rates which are close to 2 per cent.</p>  <p>   This substantial additional easing of the monetary policy stance supports and reinforces the emergence of more favourable developments for the euro area economy. In an environment of improving business and consumer sentiment, the transmission of these measures to the real economy will strengthen, thus contributing to a further improvement in the outlook for economic growth and a reduction in economic slack. This will have positive implications for the Irish economy because the euro area is Ireland's largest trading partner.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish economy should benefit from the monetary stimulus through a number of other channels which will create employment and reduce unemployment. Monetary policy works through the exchange rate channel and the depreciation of the euro will provide a further boost to Irish exports, as the majority of Irish exports are to outside the euro area. A more stable price environment, and notably the absence of deflationary pressures, will also make legacy debt less burdensome as the real debt burden becomes less onerous. </p>  <p>  Finally, by lowering real interest rates and by increasing liquidity the EAPP should lead to an easing of credit conditions and over time support increased bank lending to the real economy, both in Ireland and elsewhere in the euro area.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age is taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Work has commenced on changing this to a total contributions approach, where anomalies arising with the current method would not occur.  Under the total contributions approach, the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes. It is unlikely that this legislation will be ready in the current year.  It is my intention that the changes will be announced well in advance of introduction, to allow those workers affected to factor the new rules into their retirement planning.</p>  <p>  Where a person does not qualify for a full contributory pension following these reforms, alternatives such as the State pension (non-contributory) will continue to be available.</p></reply>

Section 37(1) of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides that VAT is chargeable on the full consideration which a taxable person becomes entitled to receive in respect of or in relation to a supply of goods or services "including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever" but not including the Value-Added Tax itself.   </p>  <p>  It is Revenue's understanding that, in general, utility providers offer discounts in two ways.  The first is a percentage discount, say 5%, on the standard energy unit price.  The discounted price, in this case 95% of the standard energy unit price, is then used to calculate the VAT-inclusive bill amount.  In this way the customer does not pay VAT on the 5% discount.  The second way is by means of a bill credit or cashback.  The bill credit or cashback amount is offset against the VAT-inclusive bill.  Take, for example, a customer whose VAT-inclusive bill is &euro;227 made up of &euro;200 plus &euro;27 VAT.  If this customer receives a bill credit or cashback of &euro;100 then the customer's bill is only &euro;127.  The utility provider accounts for VAT on the VAT-inclusive amount of &euro;127 (VAT-exclusive amount of &euro;112 plus &euro;15 VAT at 13.5% on the &euro;112) being the full consideration which the provider becomes entitled to receive in relation to that supply.  The customer's bill credit or cashback of &euro;100 is essentially a VAT-inclusive discount made up of a VAT-exclusive amount of &euro;88 plus &euro;12 VAT at 13.5% on the &euro;100).  If this is the practice described by the Deputy then it is in line with VAT legislation.</p></reply>

Provision 49 of the CCMA provides that a lender must have an appeals process to enable a borrower to appeal in relation to a decision of the lender and for this purpose must establish an Appeals Board to consider and determine any such appeals submitted by borrowers.</p><p>If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO).  The FSO, as an independent body, will consider whether the lender complied with the CCMA in reaching the decision and may direct a lender to re-assess the borrower's case.  Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at .</p><p>The Central Bank also has a Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprise (the SME Code).  Under the SME Code, regulated entities must have and implement policies and procedures for dealing with SME borrowers in financial difficulties.  Such policies and procedures must be aimed at assisting the SME borrower in the SME borrower's particular circumstances.  In particular provision 21 of the SME Code requires that the regulated entity must make available to borrowers in financial difficulty, an information booklet containing, inter alia, the borrower's right to appeal a regulated entities decision on an arrangement and the timeframes involved. Where a regulated entity is not willing to offer an alternative repayment arrangement, or if an SME borrower is not willing to accept an alternative repayment arrangement, the regulated entity must advise the SME borrower of its right to make an appeal to the regulated entity.  Where a participating bank refuses to assist with the restructuring of credit facilities up to &euro;3,000,000, SME borrowers may be entitled to refer the matter to the Credit Review Office.  SME borrowers with an annual turnover of less that &euro;3,000,000 may also take their complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p></reply>

These regulations provide that, in respect of mortgage for a principal dwelling, first time buyers will be subject to a maximum mortgage LTV of 90% for a property valued up to &euro;220,000, and subject to an 80% LTV on any excess value above that amount. For non-first time buyers, a mortgage will be limited to 80% of the value of a principal dwelling house.</p>  <p>  However, investors who wish to purchase a buy to let property will have to meet a higher deposit threshold when borrowing from a bank to fund the purchase. Such borrowers will be subject to a loan to value ratio of 70% meaning that they will have to have 30% deposit in order to obtain a mortgage on a buy to let property. </p>  <p>  Additionally the Deputy may wish to note that, in Budget 2015, I announced a number of measures to support a functioning housing market.

The European Commission in its recent winter forecasts estimated that real unit labour costs in Ireland fell by 4.3 per cent for 2014 as a whole, which is the largest decline across all EU Member States and compares with a fall of 1 per cent in the UK, a fall of  0.2 per cent in the USA and increases of 0.1 per cent in the EU, and 0.3 per cent in the euro over the same time period. </p>  <p>  Improved competitiveness has been achieved through wage moderation as compared with our trading partners as well as through productivity improvements. In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation over the last number of years has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness because Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers. For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2009. </p>  <p>  The European Central Bank's Expanded Asset Purchase Programme (EAPP), which began on 9 March, has been associated with a depreciation of the euro in recent months. This should also improve the competitiveness, and therefore the export potential, of firms in Ireland.</p></reply>

Domestic demand grew on an annual basis for the first time since 2007.  Both private consumption and investment contributed to this growth. Exports rose by 12.6 per cent annually in 2014.  This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001. Exports are now at an all-time high. Based on data published to date, Ireland was the fastest-growing economy in the EU in 2014.</p>  <p>  Other data released recently have provided room for encouragement. Consumer spending was strong in 2014 with the volume of retail sales up by over 6 per cent when compared with 2013.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up by close to 4 per cent in 2014.  This trend has continued into 2015. Headline sales were up 8.2 per cent in February with core sales up by 4.5 per cent year-on-year. </p>  <p>  Investment is also growing, with both construction activity and machinery and equipment spending on a rising path.  Recovery in the construction sector continued in February with the Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector recording its eighteenth successive month of expansion. The euro has depreciated considerably on a trade-weighted basis since last summer. This is a positive development for the Irish export sector. </p>  <p>  The improvements in the real economy are being reflected in the labour market. Total employment grew by 1.5 per cent (+29,100) over the year to Q4 2014, marking a ninth successive quarter of employment growth.  This was driven by increases in full-time employment and was broadly-based, with gains recorded in 11 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.  The unemployment rate continues to fall from the peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012, but still remains high at 10.1 per cent in February this year.</p>  <p>  My Department published its latest macroeconomic forecasts in October with Budget 2015 in which GDP is expected to expand by 3.9 per cent in 2015 and 3.4 per cent in 2016. Annual average growth of just over 3 per cent is expected in the following years.  Revised forecasts will be published with the Spring Economic Statement next month and these will take into account the latest data and developments at that point.</p></reply>

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA states that a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the lender has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement under the CCMA with the borrower or his/her nominated representative and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  The CCMA does however recognise that, having considered the full individual circumstances of the borrower, in certain cases the only available option may be the sale of the property.  In some cases this may involve voluntary surrender or legal action for repossession.</p>  <p>  When borrowers engage with their lender it is usually possible to agree a sustainable restructure to address and resolve their difficulties.  Data released by the Central Bank shows that almost 115,000 mortgage accounts were classified as re-structured at the end of 2014.  This represented an increase of about 30,000 accounts over the course of 2014.</p>  <p>  In relation to situation where unregulated third parties have acquired loan books the Deputy should note that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation.  It is my intention to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same protections as they had prior to the sale. The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage.  The legislation is not retrospective. However, it will apply to all loans as defined, regardless of when they were acquired, thus capturing loan books that have already been sold. A similar approach was used in 2013 in relation to debt management firms.</p></reply>

The draft proposal on the CCCTB does not provide for any harmonisation of corporate tax rates within the EU. We remain steadfastly committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate which is a central element of our strategy for an export-led sustainable economic recovery that promotes investment and employment.  We will continue to play fair but play to win.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance commissioned Ernest &amp;amp; Young to carry out an independent economic impact assessment of the CCCTB proposal and this report was published in 2011.  The results of this economic impact assessment indicate that CCCTB would result in a slight reduction in employment and foreign direct investment in the EU.  It also points to the possibility of significant winners and losers arising from the re-distribution of tax bases among Member States.  </p>  <p>  It is clear from the discussions that have taken place to date on the various elements of the CCCTB proposal that there is no consensus among the Member States on the issue.  The Commission is currently reviewing the CCCTB proposal with a view to a re-launch of the proposal in the summer and Ireland will actively participate in any ensuing discussions on the matter.</p></reply>

This will include trade and investment aspects of our relationship with the UK, including financial services. The research will be published in due course. </p>  <p>  We recognise, of course, that the nature of the UK's relationship with the EU is primarily an issue for the British people. While respecting that fact, my Department will continue to work alongside other Departments, particularly the Department of the Taoiseach, to enhance our understanding of any developments which have a potential impact on Ireland. We will also seek to play a constructive role in the evolving debate on the matter, when appropriate.</p></reply>

A whole-of-Government approach has been adopted in addressing the issue with a view to maximising the level of loan restructuring arrangements and minimising the number of home repossessions.  Initiatives such as the reform of Personal Insolvency legislation and establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Helpline and the availability of mortgage to rent scheme ensure that borrowers are assisted in dealing with their arrears.</p>  <p>  In March 2013 the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) framework was introduced which set out demanding quantitative targets for mortgage arrears resolution at six Irish mortgage lenders who account for about 90% of the mortgages in Ireland. The six lenders (Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Permanent tsb, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank) were required to meet targets for proposed and concluded sustainable solutions at quarterly intervals.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  Under the CCMA a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession only after it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative and specific timeframes have been adhered to, or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Central Bank monitor the situation in regard to mortgage arrears on an ongoing basis.  Data published by the Central Bank in early March for end-2014 showed continued improvements in the number of PDH accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days, which reduced by 7.4% over the quarter, representing the 5th consecutive reduction the number of accounts in arrears for this category.  In addition, the number of borrowers reaching agreement with their bank to restructure their mortgage is increasing. </p>  <p>  Mortgage arrears is, however, an area that remains under continuous review.  More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, my Department is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions. Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only. The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.</p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at . Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers. </p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers. The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also lists the various charges imposed by the various financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions .  </p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking. Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit for working capital or other purposes from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p><p>As regards the success of Government policy towards assisting SMEs with enhanced lending, it should be noted that the most recent Department of Finance credit demand survey shows that 86% of credit applications were approved by the banks, with positive trends also seen around trading performance, profitability and employment. </p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was established during September 2014 with the core purpose of enhancing the supply of credit to SMEs. The SBCI has already signed up the two largest SME lenders in the country, AIB and Bank of Ireland, to deliver products to SMEs. Loans have been available since 9 March 2015 at branches of both banks throughout the entire country. SBCI's funding must be passed to SMEs and the SMEs must receive the full benefit of any discounted rate offered to the partner lenders. SBCI has committed &euro;200m to each of the initial bank lending partners and has a further &euro;400m available to other future lenders. Talks are continuing with circa ten other potential funding partners from both the banking and non-banking sectors. The SBCI will offer working capital facilities which are of at least 2 years duration. It can also offer loans for investment on longer terms, loans to agriculture and loans for the refinancing of credit originally extended by banks who have since exited the Irish market. Further information is available at .  </p><p>In seeking to build on the progress to date and to further support the financing of growth within the SME sector our focus in 2015, outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, will be to implement a series of actions under the following thematic areas:</p><p>- Support and influence the effective implementation of major policy initiatives to ensure that the maximum benefits are afforded to SMEs;</p><p>- Continue to raise awareness and understanding amongst SMEs and entrepreneurs of the full suite of State business supports that are available;</p><p>- Ensure that the Local Enterprise Office network is a key conduit in providing information, support and advice to small businesses on access to finance issues and strengthen the linkages between enterprise capacity building, accessing finance and business guidance;</p><p>- Deepen our engagement with international funding institutions;</p><p>- Facilitate and support the development of a more diverse range of financing options for SMEs;</p><p>- Maintain a strong focus on policy impact, evaluation and learning; and</p><p>- Develop measures to ensure prompt payments and promote improvements in the payment culture and practices in Ireland.</p></reply>

The aim of these European rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular bidders on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement has been operational since January 2014. Statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold tendering activity by the Irish public sector is collected and provided to the European Commission for each year. These EU statistics for 2013 and 2014 are not yet available and therefore we do not have the data to perform trend analysis on that tendering activity. The OGP plans to issue an annual report on spend and tendering analysis for 2014 similar to that recently published on 2013 data. Content of the report will be subject to data collected.   </p>  <p>  The 2013 Spend and Statistics Report mentioned above and issued by the OGP analysed a subset of total procurement spend for government.  The OGP is confident that the data set is representative of public service spend and that the collection and reporting methodology is robust. The procurement expenditure that has been classified and analysed for this report is &euro;2.742 billion across 35,827 suppliers. Of this &euro;2.742 billion 93% went to Supplier accounts in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) and 7% went to Supplier accounts outside the RoI. It must be noted that the data set for 2013 used in this report is not complete and that as more data is collected and analysed, and business profiles for Suppliers are received, the statistics may change.</p>  <p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  My Department continues to introduce changes to assist SME's in competing for government contracts. In April 2014, I introduced Circular 10/14 which provided guidance to contracting authorities on measures to reduce barriers for SMEs in tendering for public contracts. In addition, the Office of Government Procurement continues to engage with industry bodies through the SME Working Group to identify issues in public procurement and implement solutions.</p>  <p>  The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion. It is important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad.</p></reply>

We secured an increase for our vitally important prawn fishery and stability for many of our valuable stocks around our coast.  This is a good outcome for the fishing industry and it also supports a sustainable approach to protecting our fish stocks.</p><p>In terms of additional supports for the fishing industry, I launched for public consultation a &euro;241 million<i>investment programme for the seafood sector. This investment will assist seafood enterprises to sustainably grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in our coastal communities.</i></p><p>Over the last two years I was successful in negotiating <i>a doubling for the period to 2020 of the EU seafood development funds available to Ireland. Under this Programme, &euro;147m will be provided to Ireland under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. Government is providing an additional &euro;94 million in co-funding, demonstrating our commitment to growing and developing the sector. The details of exactly how this package will be distributed are contained in a proposal that is currently undergoing a public consultation process at which point I will be considering all views and discussing them with stakeholders.</i></p></reply>

Priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;.

We are keen to increase our access to the American market for dairy products, pig-meat, beverages and food ingredients. Now that we have gained access to the US beef market, we want to grow that trade by securing higher quotas and lower tariffs. </p>  <p>  Of course we have defensive interests as well. One of these is our beef sector where we are mindful of the potential of increased imports of US beef to have a negative effect on the economics of EU and Irish beef production, particularly beef from suckler cows. We must ensure that the EU market is not undermined by over-supply and our proposals to mitigate the impact of quotas and tariff cuts are well known to the Commission. These defensive interests should be seen in the light of the current high US beef prices which at least temporarily reduce the US competitive advantage, and the recent opening of the US market to Irish beef, with the favourable prospects for capitalising on this through TTIP by further reductions in beef tariffs and the opening of a quota for the EU.  </p>  <p>  On the dairy side, the focus of our expanded production post-quota is on emerging markets in Asia, and indeed the United States, and we do not see increased imports from the US to the EU as a significant threat. There are also significant market opportunities for Irish pig-meat in the United States and it is important that we balance our defensive interests in this sector against the prospects for increasing our exports. </p>  <p>  Finally in relation to food standards, it is a prerequisite in these negotiations and a red line for me that imports from the United States must comply with equivalent standards of animal health, welfare and food safety to those observed by EU producers and processors. </p>  <p>  We are at a relatively early stage in these negotiations but I am confident that there is sufficient determination and good will to secure an agreement that will be beneficial on both sides of the Atlantic.</p></reply>

Recent tragic events in that part of the Mediterranean have underlined the significant challenges which need to be addressed by the international community, and I agreed to the transfer of ownership of L&Eacute; Aoife to the Maltese Armed Forces on humanitarian grounds.</p>  <p>  While the vessel is no longer viable for use in Irish waters it is ideally suited to address a pressing short-term requirement. The donation of L&Eacute; Aoife will contribute additional capability to the Maltese authorities, and especially the Armed Forces of Malta in their humanitarian work.   </p>  <p>  Discussions between officials of my Department and the Maltese authorities regarding the modalities for the transfer of ownership of L&Eacute; Aoife to the Maltese Armed Forces took place in the Naval Base last week and are expected to be finalised shortly.</p></reply>

This figure does not include non-EEA students who are in the State to engage in studies for a period of less than 3 months or who have permission to remain in the State in a different category (for example as a dependant of an Irish or EEA national).</p><p>The main countries of origin for the persons concerned are the following: Brazil 30%, China 9%, USA 8%, India 7%, Malaysia 6%, Saudi Arabia 5%, Venezuela 4%.</p><p>It is not possible to provide visas statistics for each of the past ten years. Prior to the introduction of a new computerised visa system by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department in 2008 and rolled out to Irish Missions and Visa Office worldwide throughout 2008 and 2009, only limited statistical information was recorded, often manually, at individual offices. However I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that the statistics set out below are available. </p><p><b>Irish Study Visa Applications Outcomes</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Net Granted</th><th>Net Refused</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>4849</td><td>4405</td><td>9254</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>4563</td><td>2238</td><td>6801</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>4049</td><td>1140</td><td>5189</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>5123</td><td>754</td><td>5877</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>4741</td><td>671</td><td>5412</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>6939</td><td>851</td><td>7790</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>9099</td><td>1751</td><td>10850</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10462</td><td>1886</td><td>12348</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that nationals from many countries including for example Brazil, USA do not require a visa to come and study in Ireland. For nationals requiring a visa, in line with other jursidictions my Department operates a visa system which examines the bona fides of each study visa application. The requirements and  procedures that are in place are designed to ensure that potential abuses of the study visa system are minimised, whilst also affording visa required non-EEA nationals with every opportunity to come and study in Ireland. Whilst the requirements are rigorous they are also fair.</p><p>In common with other jurisdictions the non-EEA student immigration system has suffered abuses. This became especially apparent last year through inspections by my Department and media revelations where colleges (many of which are now closed and one which is currently suspended) and in some cases students were effectively circumventing the rules which apply to non-EEA nationals studying in Ireland. In that regard I remain fully committed to delivering on the Government's regulatory reforms programme in this area which I announced in September 2014 in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills. These reforms provide the necessary regulatory framework through which abuses of the student immigration system can be curtailed to the benefit of bona fide students and colleges alike.  The Government is committed to maintaining Ireland's reputation as a high quality destination for international students and will continue to implement all necessary reforms to protect that reputation.</p><p>Work is at an advanced stage in implementing these reforms taking into account a high court judgement in respect of that part of the reform programme relating to English language courses, and I expect that full details will be available shortly.</p></reply>

This included the funding of some 60 services throughout the country:</p>  <p> - &euro;10m for 20 Crisis Refuges and support services </p>  <p> - Over &euro;4 million for 16 Rape Crisis Centres </p>  <p> - Almost &euro;3.5 million for 24 Domestic Violence Support Services. </p>  <p>  In addition, funding of &euro;2.54m for domestic violence refuge services has recently transferred to my Department's Vote from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and in turn to Tusla. The purpose of this funding transfer is to ensure that the State&rsquo;s relationship with domestic violence services is managed in a manner which is more coherent and adapted to the needs of service users i.e. victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Tusla has concluded a review of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services and a consolidated national budget is now in place for these services.  A roadmap for the future delivery of services has been approved by the Board of the Agency.  There is for the first time a consolidated national budget for sexual violence and domestic violence services and an opportunity for more co-ordinated and equitable provision of domestic and sexual violence services across the country.  The Agency will continue to engage with funded organisations and representatives of all those involved in the delivery of services were invited to consultations throughout the review process.  </p>  <p>  A structure for the national oversight of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services is currently being put in place, with dedicated roles to support the delivery of these services. This approach will facilitate the provision of effective, high quality services with more equitable availability of services across different geographical areas and different population groups. Future planning for domestic violence and sexual violence services will seek to address gaps, avoid duplication and support effective delivery of frontline services nationally.</p>  <p>  I have met recently with representatives of many of the 16 Rape Crisis Centres around the country to discuss issues and developments in that sector.  I continue to be updated on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Service matters as they arise and my Department is in close contact with Tusla in relation to this important area.</p></reply>

The foster care allowance is tax exempt.   </p>  <p>  Respite care is defined in the National Standards for Foster Care as &lsquo;short term care provided to a child in order to support the child, his or her parent(s) or foster carers by providing a break for the child and his or her primary caregivers&rsquo;.

Respite care would not feature in all placements, and would normally be included as part of the child's care plan if it is to be availed of during the placement.  Where planned respite care is for a period of less than a week, then a pro-rata payment is made based on the foster care allowance for a full week.

Finglas south and west remains a priority for both the Department and the HSE as it is one of the communities most in need of access to primary care services.

Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. Premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. </p>  <p>  Community-rated markets depend on a continuing entry of younger people, to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out private health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings. From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over, set at 2% per year for each year over the age of 34, up to a a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over. There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it. A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover when a full adult premium is paid in respect of anyone, including spouses and dependant students. In addition, a credited period (in total not exceeding 3 years) is also available for individuals who previously had health insurance but relinquished cover since 1 January 2008 due to unemployment. In such cases, the level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s).  </p>  <p>  LCR relates solely to the current voluntary health insurance market and any loadings that apply after the 1 May 2015 will apply in subsequent years, until Universal Health Insurance is in place.</p></reply>

The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed by the Government in 2013 on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy. The other measures (eg for the HSE, professional bodies etc) set out in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant departments and organisations.

For this reason, the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a number of important new mechanisms, including an independent Historical Investigations Unit, which will take forward investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths from the former PSNI Historical Enquiries Team process and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In addition to a Historical Investigations Unit, the Stormont House Agreement makes provision for the establishment of an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, an Oral History Archive and an Implementation and Reconciliation Group to oversee themes, archives and information recovery across the framework for dealing with the legacy of the past.  It provides further for the NI Executive to take appropriate steps to improve the way the legacy inquests function is conducted in Northern Ireland to comply with ECHR Article 2 requirements.  The Agreement sets out that processes dealing with the past should be victim-centred and emphasises the importance of providing services and support to victims and survivors. </p>  <p>  Primary legislation to establish the Historical Investigations Unit will be taken forward at Westminster and I understand that the intention is to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to enable the Unit to be established in 2016. Notwithstanding the complex work involved in establishing these mechanisms, I am confident that the British Government shares the Irish Government&rsquo;s resolve that the new framework to address the legacy of the past is put in place at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  The Government has committed to putting all necessary arrangements in place to ensure full cooperation with the Historical Investigations Unit, including legislation if necessary.  Any such legislation in this jurisdiction will be a matter for consideration by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the first instance.</p>  <p>  The efficient and expeditious implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in its totality is a key focus for the Government.  On 27 March I participated in a second implementation and review meeting of the Agreement in Belfast with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive Parties; it was a useful opportunity to take stock of progress.  The two Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive parties must continue to work collectively to meet the objectives we set together and to ensure that the overall benefit of the Stormont House Agreement is realised for the people of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

This includes freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture in detention. There are concerns in particular about the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists and bloggers, and human rights defenders.  Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of our engagement and dialogue with Iran.</p>  <p>  During my address to the Human Rights Council on 4 March, I expressed my concern that &ldquo;Freedom of Religion and Belief is in peril in many places worldwide, with members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faith, disproportionately affected by violence, discrimination, and harassment.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call strongly for the release of the seven Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; leaders and the end to the persecution of members of this faith in Iran, including through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN.  Ireland has been instrumental in consistent activity by the EU in raising the discriminatory treatment of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s in Iran.</p>  <p>  Bilaterally, our concerns are conveyed to the Iranian Ambassador and Embassy on all appropriate occasions.  Moreover, in January 2015, during political consultations with Iran, which took place in Dublin, my Department again directly communicated our concerns regarding the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i community to the visiting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Majid Takht Ravanchi.</p>  <p>  During Iran&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council in April 2014, Ireland voiced concerns in its intervention regarding the situation of religious minorities, including recommending that Iran review its policies discriminating against students on account of their faith, ensure that the trials of members of religious minorities are conducted in a fair and transparent manner, and accord them the full rights of citizens of Iran.</p>  <p>  At the 27th Session of the Human Rights Council in September 2014, under Agenda Item Four, on human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention, Ireland raised concerns that some groups, including those of the Baha&rsquo;i faith and some Christian groups, are subject to significant persecution.</p>  <p>  We also raised the issue at the 28th Session of the Human Rights Council in March 2015 during the interactive dialogues with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief. </p>  <p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the Irish Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with the EU, will continue to encourage progress in relation to religious minorities in Iran and to make clear our concerns to the Iranian authorities at every appropriate opportunity.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p>  <p>  Home tuition is provided to children with autism aged between 2.5 and 3 years of age as they cannot enrol in a school until they reach the age of three.</p>  <p>  Parents can choose to enrol children with autism in an early intervention class from the age of three and where such a placement is not available home tuition is approved. Children with autism over the age of four may also be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them.</p>  <p>  The annual circular for the 2014/2015 Home Tuition Scheme (048/2014) is available on www.education.ie and provides detailed information on the purpose of the scheme including the eligibility criteria. Home tuition is intended as an interim provision only for children with a special educational need for whom a school placement is not available and is not intended to be regarded as an optional alternative to school.</p>  <p>  All State-funded primary and post primary schools have been allocated additional resources to provide for children with special educational needs enrolled in school.</p>  <p>  For children for whom mainstream provision may not be appropriate, my Department has provided placement options, in 2014/15, in some 125 special schools which have approximately 1,000 teachers and approximately 860 special classes located around the country, 95 of which are early intervention classes for young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>  <p>  Primary and Post Primary schools have a permanent allocation of additional teaching supports to provide for children whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category.</p>  <p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for children with additional care needs, as outlined in Circular 00030/2014 and additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the National Council Special Education (NCSE) is currently at an advanced stage in the preparation of policy advice on the education of children with autism which includes a review of early intervention provision.</p>  <p>  I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views, both National and International and will provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

This reform was accompanied by an intensive programme of continuous professional development for teachers, provided by the Project Maths Development Team.</p>  <p>  In addition, a two year part-time Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching (Level 8) is being run by the NCE-MSTL consortium. Almost 800 teachers, over the last three years,  have enrolled in this programme. These two major commitments were prioritised so as to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in post-primary mathematics. </p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle, literacy and numeracy are being embedded as key skills, not only in English and Mathematics, but also in all of the new subject specifications as they are being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the national literacy and numeracy strategy, the NCCA has initiated a review of the primary maths curriculum.  The revision of the curriculum will be on a phased basis, with the initial focus being on the development of a revised mathematics curriculum for children in the first four years of primary school, from junior infants to second class inclusive.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in relation to integrated languages curriculum.  The development of a new integrated languages Curriculum for the first four years of primary schools (Junior Infants to Second Class) is nearing completion.  It will be implemented to schools from September 2016 but will be available to teachers to engage with from September 2015.</p>  <p>  All schools are required (Circulars 0039/2012 primary and 0040/2012 post-primary) to engage in planning for improvement in the areas of literacy and numeracy as part of the school self-evaluation process. This planning requires schools to gather information about current outcomes and to use this evidence to set targets for improvement. This is done on a whole-school basis with a focus on changing teaching and learning in all classrooms. While the improvement plan is developed at whole-school level, it should be implemented in every class and across all subjects at post-primary level.</p></reply>

I would like to assure the Deputy that the matters raised are of serious concern to my Department and my officials have been working with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in order to have the concerns dealt with. I understand that NCAD is currently working on implementing a number of changes and improvements in its systems and processes in order to address the issues identified in the C&amp;amp;AG report.</p><p>Details of the recurrent funding, including grant in lieu of tuition fees funding, provided to NCAD is set out in the table.</p><p>Higher education institutions such as NCAD are autonomous bodies and have responsibility for their own day to day affairs. Many students in the higher education sector are required to pay additional charges, over and above the Student Contribution, relating to the cost of their course including costs associated with Garda vetting, health screening, fieldtrips etc. Similar charges for materials commonly occur in art and design programmes in other institutions. A referendum of registered students usually only occurs where a levy is to be introduced to contribute to the cost of specific facilities for student services purposes, e.g. student centre, sports facilities.</p><p>In relation to the fee payable for the Masters course in NCAD, again, institutions are autonomous bodies and therefore the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged in relation to postgraduate study is determined by the institutions and I have no role in relation to the matter. However, it should be noted that the average postgraduate tuition fee in other higher education institutions can range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000.</p><p>The three-year term of office of the board of the NCAD expired on 1 March 2015. A new board will be appointed for a three year period up to 1 March 2018. Members of the board are appointed in accordance with Sections 6 and 7 of the NCAD Act, 1971. My Department has recently sought expressions of interest from suitably qualified candidates for consideration for appointment as Chairs and ordinary members to boards and governing bodies of institutions and other bodies in the higher education sector including NCAD. Expressions of interest were sought by way of a public advertisement on www.education.ie and www.stateboards.ie. The expressions of interest received are being processed and the new NCAD board will be appointed as soon as possible.</p><p><b>Details of recurrent funding provided to the National College of Art &amp;amp; Design</b><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><div><b>Grant</b></div></th><th><div><b>Fees</b></div></th><th><div><b>Total &euro;</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td><div>&euro;6,139,716 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,781,384 </div></td><td><div>&euro;8,921,100 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td><div>&euro;6,994,247 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,806,417 </div></td><td><div>&euro;9,800,664 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td><div>&euro;7,410,694 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,997,960 </div></td><td><div>&euro;10,408,654 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td><div>&euro;8,223,667 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,181,400 </div></td><td><div>&euro;11,405,067 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td><div>&euro;8,684,724 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,959,000 </div></td><td><div>&euro;11,643,724 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td><div>&euro;9,966,471 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,786,700 </div></td><td><div>&euro;12,753,171 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td><div>&euro;10,853,678 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,961,900 </div></td><td><div>&euro;13,815,578 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td><div>&euro;10,415,162 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,433,064 </div></td><td><div>&euro;12,848,226 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td><div>&euro;10,532,000 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,189,575 </div></td><td><div>&euro;12,721,575 </div></td></tr></table></p><p><i>Provisional core grant allocation for 2015: &acirc;‚¬4,889,311 (excluding amounts yet to be allocated, e.g. pensions).</i></p><p><i>Amount of fees already paid to date in 2015: &acirc;‚¬700,000.

As the Deputy may be aware, the Student Contribution, which is payable by students who qualify for free fees funding, includes certain student service activities including student union services.</p>  <p>  A working group was set up by the HEA, at the request of my Department, in 2011 in order to agree a definition for student services for reporting purposes and to update the former HEA Framework of Good Practice for the Provision of Student Services. A revised Framework was subsequently introduced in 2011 by the HEA. The working group agreed a list of areas and activities to be included under the definition of student services and this includes student union activities.</p></reply>

Therefore any person is free to set up a private college of education or an English language school without having to come under the oversight of the Department or any of its agencies.  The majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run and there is a diverse range of English language courses on offer which vary considerably in duration and intensity.</p><p>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of English language schools is only available to my Department in respect of those that have gone through a recognised quality assurance process.  Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) operates ACELS (Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services), which is a voluntary scheme that grants recognition to English language teaching organisations annually.</p><p>Currently there are 98 English language organisations nationwide holding ACELS recognition.  The breakdown of these organisations by county is easily accessible on an interactive map available at: .  It should be noted that many of these 98 organisations are not sole English language training providers.  Some also operate additional seasonal centres for juniors, typically in the summer.  Others operate only as seasonal providers during the summer with junior programmes.  Some other providers offer a mixed provision of programmes including further and/or higher education programmes in addition to English language courses.</p><p>With regard to student numbers, the majority of English language training organisations operate a system of 'rolling enrolment' i.e. students may enrol at regular intervals onto courses, typically every Monday of a new week or per fortnight.  Language school enrolments are very often short-term, and because of this, ACELS does not require providers to supply student enrolment numbers.  As a result, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the current number of students in each of these organisations.</p><p>The number of recognised English language training organisations which have voluntarily submitted and gained recognition through the ACELS scheme fluctuates annually.  However over the last 10 years, QQI estimates that this number has been within a range of 95-120 organisations, comprising approximately 130-160 centres either permanent or temporary nationwide.</p><p>There are currently 24 non-ACELS English language training providers listed on the internationalisation register for immigration purposes offering other English language training awards, mainly UK aligned.  There may also be other non-ACELS English language training organisations operating domestically which are not on the internationalisation register. Typically, these are regional seasonal operators offering junior courses, who have relationships with other EU schools/agents and don't see a need to gain ACELS recognition.</p></reply>

Many thousands of students from the EU and around the world come to Ireland for full-time or short-term programmes.  The vast majority of providers of English language training in the State operate to a high standard and are motivated by the desire to enable learners to reach their potential.  However, it is evident that a minority of providers do not operate to the same standards, with serious implications for students and the reputation of the wider international education sector.</p>  <p>  For this reason, I announced robust regulatory reforms to the international education sector together with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 2nd September 2014. These reforms include specific measures to ensure the bona fides of English language colleges.</p>  <p>  A key pillar of these reforms is a strengthened and more integrated inspection regime of providers of international education including English language colleges, which entails an enhanced inspection function for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) which will be linked to Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority.</p>  <p>  A new quality assurance process to control entry by English language providers to the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) - the list of eligible programmes for immigration purposes - is being finalised by officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality and will be submitted to Government shortly for approval.</p>  <p>  Another key pillar of the regulatory reforms is the International Education Mark (IEM) and related Code of Practice.  The IEM was proposed in Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010 - 2015 as a means of enhancing the quality and promotion of international education in Ireland.  The IEM confirms that a provider has demonstrated their capacity and commitment to provide a high-quality educational experience to international students.  The Code of Practice includes requirements relating to the protection of enrolled learners, treatment of fees and tax compliance, and will also address other 'non-academic' issues such as recruitment, marketing and accommodation. Providers of English language training will have to demonstrate compliance with the Code before being authorised to use the Mark.</p>  <p>  The Mark will be used both as a driver of quality assurance within institutions, including English language colleges, and as a marketing tool to underpin the promotional activities of Enterprise Ireland in seeking to attract international learners to Ireland. In addition, the Mark will be used for immigration purposes.  From 2016 it will become a requirement that providers wishing to recruit English language students from outside the EEA have authorisation to use the Mark.  English language providers authorised to use the Mark will also be subject to ongoing monitoring and review.</p></reply>

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.</p>  <p>  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. </p>  <p>  The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. </p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-8738700.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Government gave approval in March last year for drafting the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  The Bill is on the Government legislative programme for publication in the Spring/Summer session.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Admissions to School Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent. The framework proposes new powers for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the Child and Family Agency to designate a school place for those children who cannot get any school place. </p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the draft Bill will provide for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. </p>  <p>  The draft Bill will also provide for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion.</p><p>Pobal were asked to undertake the management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.</p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. Details of the bridging funding provided are set out in the table.</p><p>The review process is well underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process. I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review in the coming months.<table><tr><th>Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland</td><td>53,882</td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td>45,592 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government. </p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete.  Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.  The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that SMEs were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes. </p>  <p>  As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to engage in consultations with the market on the matter prior to the tender process. It should be noted that there are no legal mandatory standards required for the manufacture of personal alarms.  Many of the existing units comply with the EU standard; newer manufacturers of equipment or the newer more innovative technologies may meet other quality standards e.g. ISO standard. Under the tender competition, those suppliers that meet the minimum requirement would score the minimum amount of marks available and suppliers that propose products over and above the minimum requirements would be awarded a higher score. </p>  <p>  The operational handover between my Department and Pobal is proceeding and should be completed mid-year. In the meantime community and voluntary groups wishing to draw down grant support under the Seniors Alert Scheme should continue to apply to my Department in the usual way. </p>  <p>  While I have taken note of the concerns expressed, it should be noted that Pobal will only manage the Scheme on behalf of my Department; the strategic policy direction of the Scheme will remain my Department&rsquo;s responsibility.

They fall under the category of pedal cycles for legal purposes.  As such, there is no requirement to register a rickshaw and it is therefore not possible to provide estimates of their numbers.  However, they are bound by road traffic legislation and must obey the rules of the road.  Among other legislative requirements, this means they are barred from pedestrian-only streets.</p><p>I have indicated my intention to extend the fixed charge notice system to cover road traffic offences by cyclists, which will include rickshaws.  </p><p>Dublin City Council has written to me regarding its wish to regulate rickshaws.  Its legal advisors had suggested that the proposed regulatoy regime would go beyond the scope of existing local authority powers to make bye-laws. As a result the Council sought that provision be made through primary legislation to extend the scope of those powers.</p><p>A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is required in respect of any proposal to Government seeking permission to initiate primary legislation with a regulatory purpose. The RIA would have to set out a clear statement of the regulatory objective and an evaluation of the different possible approaches to achieving that objective. It is only when the RIA is concluded that it will become clearer as to whether primary legislation is indeed appropriate and, if so, the nature of that legislation.  As rickshaws are a local matter, I informed the Council that it would be appropriate that the Council prepare the RIA.  Any questions about progress in that regard should therefore be directed to the Council.</p></reply>

It is understood that since the enactment of the legislation the Ward Union Hunt have operated a &ldquo;drag hunt&rdquo; in order to comply with the legislation.  This form of hunting involves the release of a deer to set a scent over a course. Following the recapture of the deer, the hounds and horses follow the scent. This practice is not considered to be hunting, as defined in the Wildlife Acts.   Both the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and An Garda Siochana are currently investigating alleged breaches of the legislation and if there is sufficient evidence to support the alleged breaches, prosecutions will be brought under the Wildlife Acts.</p></reply>
