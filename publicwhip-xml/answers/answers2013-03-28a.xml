The emphasis of the Emigrant Support Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, frontline welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities. These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas (particularly in Britain and the United States), reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements.</p><p>  While the support of frontline welfare services continues to be the priority of the ESP, the expansion of the programme has enabled the Government to invest in a range of community and heritage projects, which foster a greater sense of Irish identity, as well as strategic capital projects. These grants are a key part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to developing strong and meaningful links with Irish communities overseas and to securing the long term future of these communities. </p><p>  Between 2004 and 2012 over &euro;104 million has been provided under the Programme. The total spend in 2010 was &euro;11.93 million, &euro;11.57 million in 2011 and &euro;11.59 million in 2012.  Details of all grant recipients since 2006 can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  I am pleased that despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained funding under the ESP at a level of &euro;11.59 million for 2013.  The 2013 grant round closed on 20 February with applications for 360 projects received from 17 countries.</p><p>  The applications are currently under review.  The focus in 2013 will be on supporting key frontline welfare and advisory services and on projects aimed at supporting new arrivals.</p></reply>

It has transformed a continent that for so long was torn apart by war and division, shattering the lives of millions.  This has been achieved through an unprecedented process of political, economic and social cooperation among the countries of Europe over those decades. The history of the European Union is one of evolution and transformation as it has grown and deepened to meet the challenges of each era. </p><p>  The unprecedented economic crisis that has faced the Union and, more especially, the euro zone over recent years is the challenge for our generation. With 26 million unemployed across the European Union, the crisis has undoubtedly placed many of our citizens under great pressure. As the European Union continues to respond, it is imperative that we ensure that our citizens do not become alienated or isolated from the European project, and that its core values prevail. </p><p>  The need for popular understanding of and support for the European Union, is now more crucial than ever. While it is a challenge for us all, this is a particular responsibility for elected representatives at national and European level. </p><p>  The European Union, in advancing plans for a strengthened Economic and Monetary Union, has acknowledged the need for a social dimension and for enhanced democratic accountability and legitimacy. As we take further steps to respond to the economic crisis, it is vital that social aspects, and democratic accountability and legitimacy are central to our efforts.  They cannot be treated as an afterthought. Governments, national parliaments and the European Parliament have a key role to play in this regard. It will be important to get the balance right between the appropriate roles at national and European level. </p><p>  We are also exploring the social dimension of Economic and Monetary Union ahead of a report from President Van Rompuy in June. And Ireland is actively contributing to that important debate.</p><p>  Democratic accountability and legitimacy are also key priorities for the Irish Presidency. These issues have been the focus of comprehensive and constructive discussions at high-level events hosted by the Presidency in Dublin recently, including the Informal Meeting of Ministers and State Secretaries for EU Affairs, as well as the COSAC Chairpersons Conference. </p><p>  This year is also European Year of Citizens. Following its launch in Dublin last January, Citizen&rsquo;s dialogues have been organised across Ireland and throughout the wider Union. This is an ideal opportunity to celebrate the rights and benefits we enjoy, as citizens of the European Union, and to engage in a broader debate on the future direction of our Union. Whatever course that takes, it must maintain at its heart the interest of the citizens of Europe. </p></reply>

The issue is regularly discussed at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, most recently earlier this month when High Representative Ashton briefed on the latest round of negotiations which took place in Almaty last month.</p><p>  The concerns to which Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme have given rise are documented in a series of UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions dating back to 2006.  The IAEA has reported at length on Iran&rsquo;s continuing failure to provide clarity on, and facilitate unimpeded access to, its nuclear activities and facilities.</p><p>  The IAEA&rsquo;s most recent report makes clear that this continuing non-cooperation makes it impossible for the Agency to resolve concerns about aspects of the Iranian nuclear programme, including those which concern possible military dimensions to that programme.  There is no dispute with any country seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes within the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  However, this requires that each country seeking such energy cooperates fully with the IAEA.</p><p>  To date, Iran has failed to address satisfactorily a number of concerns raised by the international community.  Regrettably, therefore, it has been necessary to impose several rounds of restrictive measures.  The imposition of sanctions is not an end in itself and they are not aimed at the Iranian people.</p><p> The sole aim of these measures has been to convince Iran to return to the negotiating table and to engage with the E3+3 in order to address the serious questions regarding possible military dimensions of its nuclear programme. </p><p>  I have no doubt that the EU&rsquo;s measures, complemented by tough sanctions imposed by other countries, have led to Iran&rsquo;s belated acceptance of talks.  I welcome last month&rsquo;s discussions in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the technical meeting last week in Istanbul, and I consider it positive that further talks are planned for Almaty on 5-6 April.  This effort can only succeed, and sanctions can only be reversed, if Iran is prepared to negotiate genuinely.  A credible package of confidence-building proposals was put forward last month by the E3+3.    I very much hope that Iran will engage seriously with these proposals and work rapidly to resolve the outstanding issues in relation to its nuclear programme and the serious concerns raised by the international community. </p></reply>

The 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women took place from 4 to 15 March 2013. The priority theme for the session was the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. The outcome aimed for in this regard was a set of Agreed Conclusions, which are negotiated by all states and, in accordance with normal practice, adopted on the basis of consensus.    </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s official delegation to the CSW was led by Ms Kathleen Lynch T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality with responsibility for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People.  It included officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In addition, representatives from civil society organisations were part of the delegation.</p><p>  The EU was represented in the negotiations on the Agreed Conclusions by the EU Delegation, supported by the Irish Presidency.  Following extensive negotiations, consensus on the Agreed Conclusions was reached on 15 March 2013.  Ireland, working closely with EU and other like-minded partners, contributed actively to what has been widely received as a positive outcome.   Previously identified national priorities are clearly reflected in the Agreed Conclusions, including a strong condemnation all forms of violence against women and girls; recognition of the linkages with gender inequality and discrimination;  a commitment to end impunity; and references to women, peace and security, women human rights defenders, and the need for coordinated, multisectoral services.  New elements incorporated into the Agreed Conclusions include the role of men and boys in addressing the issue, and the role which victims and survivors can play as agents for change.</p><p>  The Agreed Conclusions (currently in unedited format) are available on the website of the 57th Session of the CSW. </p><p>  In addition to the negotiations on the agreed conclusions, the Minister of State chaired a number of side events.   The first of these, entitled &ldquo;Mobilising communities to prevent and respond to violence against women &ndash; lessons learnt from Uganda&rdquo;, looked at Irish Aid&rsquo;s work in Uganda. The second, entitled &ldquo;Addressing Gender Based Violence in post conflict and fragile states &ndash; a case study of Sierra Leone&rdquo;, presented the results of research carried out by the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence.  The Minister of State also participated in a European Union event, at which she outlined the National Strategy developed by Cosc, and a side event organised by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.  </p><p>  Additionally, the Minister of State participated in a high-level consultation on &ldquo;Accelerating Zero-Tolerance to Gender Based Violence through the HIV response&rdquo; which was organised by UN Women and UNAIDS and co-sponsored by Ireland.  Her programme also included a series of bilateral contacts with a number of other Ministers and officials.</p><p>  Ireland also co-sponsored an event with Amnesty International and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which focussed on the risks faced by women human rights defenders and at which our Permanent Representative in New York was a panellist. We co-sponsored a further event organised by the Uganda based NGO, Raising Voices, which looked at implementing an evidence based approach in addressing violence against women and girls.  An event supported by Australia, South Africa and Ireland explored the potential of new media in supporting survivors of violence against women.

The purpose of these Funds is to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work, to support efforts to create better understanding between people on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, and to assist local initiatives aimed at tackling sectarianism. Funding is provided to cross border initiatives, as well as to local initiatives within Northern Ireland.  A table showing the total budget and the amount spent in support of cross border initiatives for the years 2010 to 2012 is included with this reply.</p><p>As will be noted, the total amount of funding awarded to support cross border initiatives from 2010 to 2012 was &euro;4.783 million. The total amount of funding awarded under the Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds during this period was &euro;8.7 million.</p><p>&euro;2.7 million will be made available in 2013 under the Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds. The first round of funding in 2013 is currently underway, and I expect to announce funding decisions in early May. The closing date for the second round of funding will be 27th September. At this stage it is not possible to outline what proportion of funding in 2013 will relate to cross border peace initiatives because grants are awarded based on the strength of the applications received, but it is reasonable to expect a similar proportion to that provided in previous years.</p><p>While we must acknowledge the extraordinary progress which has been made on our island over the past fifteen years, we cannot take it for granted. There is still important reconciliation work to be done, work that may take generations. In facing up to the challenges that remain, we should remember that reconciliation must be taken forward not just at the political level but also very much at the community level.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Total Budget: Reconciliation/Anti-Sectarianism Funds</div></th><th><div>Amount spent in support of cross border peace initiatives</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3 million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1.585 million</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3 million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1.674 million</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>&#8364;2.7 million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1.524 million</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8.7 million</div></td><td><div>&#8364;4.783 million</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The visit was part of a programme to three African countries - Tanzania, South Africa and Mozambique.</p><p>  In Tanzania, I visited Irish Aid funded projects and held discussions with the Tanzanian Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.  In Mozambique I chaired, on behalf of the EU, the Ministerial political dialogue between the European Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which took place in Maputo on 20 March.  I also visited Irish Aid projects in rural Mozambique.</p><p>  While in South Africa, I took the opportunity to follow up on the very successful trade mission which I led last November, involving 37 Irish companies.  During my latest visit, I met with the Board of Business Ireland Southern Africa (BISA) in Johannesburg and was guest speaker at our St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception in Johannesburg. I also met with the local representatives of Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland and ESB International for an update on new business development, including a number of case studies which we discussed in depth. I had the opportunity to launch a joint venture between an Irish company and their South African partner and to visit three other Irish companies which are expanding their business in the region.  My visit to South Africa culminated with the Greening of Table Mountain, organised by Tourism Ireland, which received considerable media coverage both locally and in the international media.</p><p>  I am confident that my trade visits to South Africa, including this most recent visit, are supporting ongoing efforts to further develop Ireland&rsquo;s economic engagement with South Africa and the wider southern Africa region.  In 2011, South Africa &ndash; Ireland trade was worth just under &euro;1.2 billion. Enterprise Ireland reports sustained interest by Irish companies in the South African market with two new companies per week on average visiting for the first time. In particular certain food and drink exports to South Africa are growing rapidly. There was an increase of 30% in dairy exports to South Africa last year.  The total value of food and drink exports to South Africa in 2012 rose to &euro;56.84 million.</p><p>  My visit was also in line with Ireland's Africa Strategy, which seeks to build on Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding development relationship with Africa.  It explicitly recognises the role which greater economic and trade cooperation can make to relations between Ireland and Africa, and to development in Africa.</p></reply>

In particular, I hosted an &quot;Invest in Ireland&quot; business forum for IDA client and target companies, jointly organised by our Consulate General and the IDA.  The event provided an excellent opportunity to reiterate to a target audience the strengths of Ireland as an investment location and to respond directly to participants' questions.  In addition, I met and briefed senior management from a number of existing companies with major investments in Ireland, including Coca-Cola and UPS.  I also met and briefed Atlanta-based members of the Global Irish Network and other key Irish leaders in Atlanta.  On the political level, I held discussions with the Governor of Georgia, Nathan Deal, and invited him to lead a trade delegation to Ireland in the near future.  I also met with Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia and discussed the prospects for progress in relation to immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing a resolution to the situation of the undocumented Irish in the US.</p><p>  In New Orleans, I addressed an event hosted by the Irish Network of New Orleans, one of the more recent additions to the Irish Networks in the US which are playing an important role in identifying ways in which Irish communities overseas can contribute to economic recovery at home. I also addressed the Ancient Order of Hibernians Annual St Patrick&rsquo;s Day Ball and attended the opening of the new Irish Cultural Museum of New Orleans.</p><p>  During the Washington DC leg of my visit, I had a bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Kerry at the US State Department on 18 March.  We discussed a range of subjects including Northern Ireland, the Irish economy, international issues including the Middle East peace process, and the prospects for comprehensive immigration reform in the US.  In relation to the latter, I underlined the Government's appreciation for the priority which the new Administration is giving to this subject and reiterated our interest in seeing a resolution for the situation of the undocumented Irish in the US.  Immigration reform was also one of the issues which both the Taoiseach and I discussed with President Obama during the bilateral meeting in the White House on 19 March.  Later that day, both the Taoiseach and I met with Senators Patrick Leahy, Charles Schumer and John McCain to express our appreciation for the efforts they are making in the Senate on the issue.  In addition, I met with the Friends of Ireland Congressional Group to underline our interest in seeing progress on the issue.</p></reply>

The country has been ravaged by a long series of violent conflicts.  Millions of innocent civilians have been killed, injured or displaced from their homes. There have been systematic abuses of human rights, extremely high levels of sexual violence and rape, and widespread recruitment and use of child soldiers.</p><p>  European Union Foreign Ministers regularly discuss developments in the DRC and are working actively to support peace efforts.  A regional Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the DRC and the Region was reached on 24 February in Addis Ababa, following discussions involving the parties in the DRC and neighbouring countries and international representatives.  I have welcomed this agreement, as have High Representative Catherine Ashton and Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, on behalf of the European Union.  It is now vital that the parties build on this framework agreement.  I welcome the decision of the UN Secretary General to appoint former President Mary Robinson as Special Envoy to the region, and can assure her of the full support of the Government, and of the European Union.  Her exceptional skills and experience, as well as her global profile, and reputation make her the ideal choice for this extremely challenging role.  She is expected to travel to the region in the coming weeks to meet the leaders who signed the agreement and to work closely with them to ensure that there is full and active implementation of its terms.</p><p>  Ireland has raised the human rights situation in the DRC at the Human Rights Council through national statements on a number of occasions, most recently at the 19th Session in March 2012. EU Council Conclusions on the Union&rsquo;s priorities at UN Human Rights Fora, adopted on 18 February 2013, state that the EU supports the Human Rights Council to address the state of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Following a resolution adopted at the 19th Session of the Human Rights Council in March 2012, on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Council is scheduled to consider the situation in DRC again at its 24th Session in September 2013.  Ireland will continue to monitor the human rights situation in the DRC closely and use our membership of the Council to raise our ongoing concerns in relations to human rights abuses and violations.</p><p>  Ireland is providing very significant ongoing support in response to the serious humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Last year, through Irish Aid, the Government provided over &euro;10 million in assistance to those worst affected in the crisis.  Earlier this month, we announced the provision of a further &euro;3.8 million in humanitarian funding.  Of this funding, &euro;2 million has been provided to the UN Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC. This provides quick and flexible funding to UN humanitarian agencies and to NGOs on the ground and aims to assist nearly four million vulnerable people in the DRC. The remaining &euro;1.8 million is being provided to Irish Aid partners, Christian Aid (&euro;450,000), Concern (&euro;450,000), Tr&oacute;caire (&euro;300,000) and Oxfam (&euro;580,000).</p></reply>

The economy of the West Bank effectively collapsed under the impact of these controls over ten years ago;  and the degree of growth seen in recent years represents only a very partial recovery of some of that lost ground.  The daily movement of Palestinian workers into Israel was severely reduced.  Exports of goods are subject to unpredictable and often lengthy delays, which are fatal for the fresh produce which constitutes most of the exports of the West Bank and which make it impossible to build up relations with importers elsewhere.  While some of these measures may originally have had a security rationale, their continued imposition now would appear to be primarily related to the security not of Israel but of the Israeli settlements planted in the West Bank.  The continuing restrictions on exports seem designed principally to prevent competition with Israeli producers.</p><p>  It is fair to note that there has been some improvement in recent years.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of Israeli checkpoints internal to the West Bank and a small increase in the number of permits to work in Israel, although the conditions imposed on these workers are very difficult.  These partial relaxations have been far too little, however, to allow normal economic activity to resume.</p><p>  The World Bank report is only the latest document to draw attention to these problems and their consequences in terms of a continuing high level of unemployment and dependence on outside aid. These are clearly ideal conditions in which militant groups can increase their support.</p><p>  Along with its EU partners and others, Ireland has pressed Israel to allow Palestinians free movement in their own territory and normal economic relations with Israel and the outside world. The Office of the Quartet Representative has engaged with Israel bilaterally on these lines for some years.  The results, I have to say, have been disappointing;  Israeli officials and leaders seem to agree in principle but proposals to relax controls and stimulate growth are not given practical effect.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to seek to focus international attention on this critical aspect of the conflict in the Middle East.</p></reply>

We continue to urge all the parties in the Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared future for the people of Northern Ireland can be based.</p><p>  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language and the languages of the various ethnic communities, as part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland.  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  </p><p>  It also called on the incoming Northern Ireland Executive to work to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. The British legislation giving effect to the St. Andrews Agreement included a specific requirement on the Executive to adopt a strategy setting out     how it proposed to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  </p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive. In that regard, my colleagues the Minister for Arts, Heritage &amp; the Gaeltacht, Mr Jimmy Deenihan T.D. and Minister of State Dinny McGinley T.D. have had ongoing discussions on the matter with their counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  On 11 July 2012, Minister N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n launched a consultation process which concluded on 27 November on strategies for the Irish language and Ulster Scots.  Inputs from the consultation process are now being considered.</p><p>  Last November I visited An Chult&uacute;rlann in Belfast which is a very impressive Irish language and cultural centre.  I had the opportunity to meet with some of the city&rsquo;s leading Irish language activists and to hear their concerns regarding the promotion of the Irish language including their views on an Irish language act for Northern Ireland.  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland, most recently when they attended the official opening of Gael&aacute;ras Mhic Ardghail in Newry on Monday 18 February.</p><p>  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. </p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of a Consultative Civic Forum as a consultative mechanism in Northern Ireland on social, economic and cultural issues. The St Andrews Agreement provided that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North/South Consultative Forum appointed by the two administrations and representative of civil society.  In September 2008 the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The review of the Civic Forum by the Northern Ireland Executive has not yet been completed.  At its meeting on 2 November 2012, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum and agreed to review the issue at a future NSMC Plenary.</p><p>  I hope that we can take this opportunity of the 15th Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement to recall the vision of a shared society which inspired that Agreement and re-dedicate ourselves to the achievement of that goal.  While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, we should not lose sight of the progress that continues to be made, including, most recently though the establishment of the North South Inter Parliamentary Association.</p></reply>

While our response has being sometimes criticised, great strides have, in fact, been made in dealing with these exceptional and complex circumstances.  EU institutional architecture per se has not fundamentally altered.  Indeed, Treaty change would be required to introduce many such changes, and I am not convinced that current circumstances would best be served by Treaty change in itself.  Instead, what has happened is that many new instruments and mechanisms have been developed to cope with emerging challenges.  At the beginning of the crisis, there were no effective support mechanisms to assist Member States in trouble. The Union has put in place the rescue mechanisms for Member States in difficulties, firstly on a temporary footing, the EFSF and the EFSM, and then a permanent support mechanism, the ESM.</p><p>  Similarly there have been significant improvements in the economic governance structures in place through agreement on a series of measures including the &ldquo;six-pack&rdquo;, the Euro Plus Pact and the Stability Treaty. The &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo; of economic governance measures, on which the Irish Presidency recently secured agreement with the European Parliament, will improve our ability to anticipate where problems arise. </p><p>  Alongside improvements in economic governance, it became evident that economic surveillance, the discussion of economic and fiscal policies, needed to take place in a more integrated manner. </p><p>  This led to the introduction of the European Semester process which is now in its third year. As Presidency, we are working with partners and the Commission to ensure that the process is as effective and meaningful as possible. The March European council saw the conclusion of the first phase of the Semester. We are making efforts to correct perceived imbalances in the management of the process and aiming to be as timely and inclusive as possible in the way we deliver on that process.</p><p>  Beyond economic governance and surveillance, it became clear that the Union needed to strengthen what underpins our Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This new strengthened EMU will be built on a more integrated financial framework or banking union. Last December, EU Finance Ministers agreed an ambitious timetable for delivering the various elements of banking union including; the Single Supervisory Mechanism; CRD IV; the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive; and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. Earlier this month, the Irish Presidency reached provisional agreement with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism. This was a top priority for the Irish Presidency. The agreement, which we as Presidency have also brokered, on CRD IV will see the risk profile of the European banking system lessened over time. As Presidency, Ireland is working intensively to make further progress on the various strands of banking union. An operational and effective banking union will help to address one of the key brakes on Europe&rsquo;s recovery.</p><p>  Beyond the short and medium term steps already taken, there is an appreciation among EU leaders that further deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union may be necessary in order to underpin the euro as a stable and credible currency into the future. </p><p>  The European Council, in December last, asked President Van Rompuy to consider and consult further on four strands &ndash; coordination of major economic reforms; the social dimension of EMU; the feasibility of contracts for competiveness and growth between governments and EU institutions; and solidarity mechanisms. President Van Rompuy will present a &ldquo;time bound roadmap&rdquo; on these issues to the June European Council. </p><p>  As Presidency, Ireland fully supports President Van Rompuy in his further work and we are facilitating discussions in the relevant Council formations. It is clear that any new steps towards strengthening economic governance will need to be accompanied by further steps towards stronger democratic legitimacy and accountability.</p></reply>

The issue was further discussed at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers which took place in Dublin last weekend and which I co-hosted with High Representative Ashton.   </p><p> This discussion will continue at the next Foreign Affairs Council on 22 April.  The current EU sanctions regime remains essential in order to maintain strong pressure upon the Syrian authorities to stop their campaign of repression and violence against the Syrian people and to engage seriously in a process of dialogue with the opposition.    </p><p>  The 18 February Foreign Affairs Council agreed to renew the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months until the end of May, while widening the scope of the exemptions applicable under the sanctions regime so to allow the provision of non-lethal military equipment and technical assistance for the purpose of protecting the civilian population. </p><p>  While some member States have indicated that they will now avail of this possibility to provide non-lethal equipment and assistance (such as training) to the Syrian National Coalition, Ireland has no plans to do so.    I believe rather that EU action must remain focussed on strong support for the efforts of the UN/League of Arab States Special Envoy Brahimi to devise a political solution based on the June 2012 Geneva Communique and to get a genuine process of transition launched within Syria. </p><p>  The EU should also concentrate on addressing the appalling humanitarian crisis resulting from a conflict which has now caused well over two million people to be internally displaced and has led to over one million Syrians taking refuge in neighbouring countries.   The EU collectively is by far the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and to the UN and international humanitarian NGOs which are assisting them, it has to date contributed almost &euro;600 million in aid.   Ireland, for its part, has contributed &euro;7.1 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria over the past twelve months.</p></reply>

Ireland is, of course, a very strong supporter of the International Criminal Court and has always supported and encouraged universal adherence to the Rome Statute.    </p><p>  The main consideration for any state in acceding to the Statute should be a willingness to subject its own actions to the jurisdiction of the ICC.  I know that many states, including many who voted in favour of granting Palestine observer state status at the General Assembly, would be concerned that any decision to accede to the Rome Statute simply in order to open another front in an already complex and deadlocked conflict with Israel may be counterproductive.  The Palestinian leadership are aware of these concerns.</p></reply>

Some member States have suggested that the Service might take on a greater role in relation to consular assistance.  Ireland believes that the EEAS has the potential to significantly improve EU effectiveness and coherence across a range of areas.   Much progress has already been made during its first two years of operation. The network of EU delegations has a particular role to play in this regard, not least in terms of sharing of information and analysis. This represents an important resource, particularly for a smaller member State such as Ireland. </p><p>  As consular protection (assistance) to citizens is a member State competence, the EEAS does not have the legal power to take on such a role.  In addition, the EEAS currently has neither the capacity nor the expertise to take on a direct role in this area.  EU delegations and other mechanisms, such as Civil Protection, can and should play an important role in assisting with the coordination of the EU&rsquo;s response to crisis situations. </p><p>  In the context of the current Review, Ireland believes that the focus should be on consolidating capacity in areas for which the EEAS already has responsibility and improving coordination mechanisms.

The Bahraini authorities must ensure, in particular, that fundamental rights in relation to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and association are fully respected. </p><p>  I have made clear in this House on a number of occasions my view that that the Bahraini Government should consider exercising clemency and releasing imprisoned activists and human rights defenders, such as Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja and Nabeel Rajab, as well as in the case of the imprisoned medical professionals.  This would serve the wider interests of promoting the reconciliation which is urgently needed reconciliation within Bahrain.</p><p>  Since the onset of unrest in 2011, High Representative Ashton and senior EU officials have regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities the EU&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.  I fully support the High Representative&rsquo;s readiness to provide, if requested, EU support for the resumed national dialogue process.</p><p>  I have ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities and I will continue to do so.   Officials in my Department make clear our concerns to the Bahraini Ambassador in London; and Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Riyadh, who is accredited to Bahrain, has raised these issues directly with the authorities there on every appropriate occasion, including most recently with the Foreign Minister while the Ambassador was in Bahrain over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.</p></reply>

The focus at these meetings was on the most appropriate steps which the EU can take in support of the ongoing efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to mitigate the worsening humanitarian situation.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have made clear that the EU strongly supports all efforts to bring about a peaceful and negotiated solution to the violence in Syria, notably those currently being undertaken by the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi.</p><p>  We also devoted considerable attention to reviewing the current EU sanctions which apply against Syria.  At the 18 February Foreign Affairs Council, we agreed to renew the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months, until 1 June. </p><p>  Accountability remains very important, in the context of the many war crimes and human rights violations that have been committed by all sides during the conflict.  Ireland has been to the fore within the EU in supporting calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  In January we joined 57 other UN members in co-signing a letter sent by Switzerland to the President of the UN Security Council which called for referral to the ICC.   I also issued a joint statement on the same subject with my Austrian, Danish and Slovenian counterparts the same month. </p><p>  As a new member of the UN Human Rights Council, we have been active during the Council&rsquo;s most recent session in building support for a strong resolution on the current human rights situation in Syria.   This resolution, which calls for referral to the appropriate international criminal justice mechanism in the case of gross human rights violations, was overwhelmingly adopted by the Council on 22 March.   </p><p>  The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, leaving millions of Syrians, in and outside the country, in need of the most essential supplies and commodities.  Ireland and its EU partners have considerably stepped up their contribution to the UN-led humanitarian relief operations;  overall EU assistance, both from the Commission and member States, amounts to date to approximately &euro;600 million while Ireland&rsquo;s overall aid to Syria over the past year amounts to &euro;7.1 million. </p><p>  The conflict in Syria will remain a major priority for Ireland at all levels of our international engagement.   We will certainly use whatever influence we have in our current EU Presidency role to support and promote European and UN efforts and initiatives towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p></reply>

This was to the effect that, for products where place of origin is indicated, it would be misleading consumers to label products made in settlements as being &rsquo;Made in Israel&rsquo;, as the settlements are not in Israel.  Likewise, it would be misleading to label them as &lsquo;Product of the West Bank&rsquo;, as this might suggest that they were Palestinian produce.   </p><p>  This guidance was based on EU consumer protection rules and is thus a clarification of an already existing position. The UK and Denmark have previously issued voluntary guidelines along the same lines.  In Ireland, my Department has for some years carried a similar set of informal guidelines on its website, for the voluntary use of Irish retailers and wholesalers.</p><p>  I welcome this latest move by the Netherlands authorities. I agree that many consumers will wish to be able to distinguish settlement goods.  At my direction, my Department has been considering the possibilities of further action on similar lines, whether domestically or at EU level.  Action across the EU would obviously be preferable, and we have been engaged for some months in discussions with like-minded partners, and with the External Action Service and the European Commission, about possible steps.   These discussions are continuing and will be assisted by a recent positive letter on the subject which High Representative Ashton has addressed to all EU Foreign Ministers. I have this week written back to her, together with a number of my fellow Foreign Ministers, to encourage the adoption of EU guidelines on labelling.</p></reply>

The meeting was organised following the detailed discussion on the situation in Mali at the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers which I chaired in Dublin on 11 and 12 February.  The meeting reached agreement on the announcement by Commissioner Piebalgs that up to &euro;250 million in European Union development assistance for Mali will be made available this year.</p><p>  The meeting in Brussels was addressed by the Foreign Minister and the Finance Minister of Mali, who provided updates on the latest situation in the country.  They made it clear that the immediate development priorities of the Malian authorities were the rebuilding of basic infrastructure in northern Mali following the destruction caused by retreating militant groups, the funding of basic social services and the financing of elections due to take place in July.</p><p>  In response, EU Ministers outlined bilateral approaches being undertaken in support of basic services, employment opportunities for young people and ongoing humanitarian needs.  There was agreement among Member States that EU support to rebuild basic social services in Mali was a priority, but that appropriate safeguards, in the form of technical assistance and audits, must be put in place given the inherent risks of working in such a fragile environment.  The Commission indicated that the provision of development aid would be based on four essential criteria: implementation of the political roadmap; macro-economic stability, public financial management and budget transparency.  During the discussion, I stressed that support for the Malian authorities should also be linked to progress on human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles.  The Malian Foreign Minister committed to establishing a Commission for Dialogue and Reconciliation and said that all the communities of northern Mali would be invited to participate, including the minority Tuareg community.</p><p>  The situation of internally displaced persons and refugees was also discussed and EU Ministers outlined bilateral support from Member States.  I noted that over &euro;9 million was provided by Ireland in 2012 for emergency food, water and healthcare to communities affected by the crisis across the Sahel region.  Some &euro;1.25 million of this funding was for life-saving assistance to vulnerable communities in Mali as well as Malian refugees who have fled the conflict to Burkina Faso.  I also indicated that a further &euro;1.8 million was being provided by Irish Aid in 2013 for those worst affected by the crisis in Mali, including assistance to displaced people and refugees.</p></reply>

Ireland is supportive of a strong EEAS that fulfils the vision set out in the Lisbon Treaty of an effective and coherent EU foreign policy.  The EEAS has achieved much in its first two years of operation.  Ireland believes that the focus for now should be on consolidating the progress made to date and improving coordination mechanisms, in particular with the European Commission.</p><p>  As regards the European Neighbourhood Policy, we believe that the current arrangements whereby the EEAS and the Commission jointly represent EU member States in relation to this Policy have worked well to date.  The Neighbourhood has been identified as a priority area of work for the High Representative and the EEAS.  There are also important linkages between neighbourhood and enlargement policy, for which the Commission has overall responsibility.  While an expansion of the EEAS role in this area might be a logical development over the longer term, in the short to medium term the focus should be on ensuring coherence and effectiveness of EU policy, regardless of whether the EEAS or Commission is in the lead.  There may also be scope for further developing the High Representative&rsquo;s double-hatted role as Vice President of the Commission.</p><p>  As regards the EU&rsquo;s development policy, Ireland believes that the new arrangements on the functioning of the EEAS will over time assist in the more effective integration of development into the EU&rsquo;s overall external relations and improve the effectiveness of both development policy and broader foreign policy.  We would hope to see, in particular, a more central focus on poverty reduction.  We welcome the progress that has been made in increasing cooperation between EU delegations and member State missions through the new joint programming initiative which is being rolled out on a trial basis in partner countries.  EU Delegations have successfully taken on a co-ordination role in many of the pilot countries and will help ensure that the EU speaks with one voice in partner countries.</p><p>  Ireland is taking an active interest in the EEAS Review, which was also the subject of discussions at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Dublin on 22-23 March.  We look forward to hearing the proposals of the High Representative in due course.</p></reply>

The uncertainties linked to the elections in both Israel and the USA contributed to this stalemate.   Conversely, the renewed electoral mandates now of both the Israeli Government and the US Administration provide an important opportunity to restore momentum to the process.</p><p>  While it is important not to overstate matters or to create false expectations, President Obama&rsquo;s visit to Israel last week represented an early move on the part of the United States to explore this opportunity.  The President made clear that he was in listening mode and would not be launching any initiative.    </p><p>  Nonetheless, his public outreach to both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples (including an important address in Jerusalem on 21 March to a largely young Israeli audience) and his lengthy political discussions in private with both parties to the conflict were significant steps. The President and Secretary Kerry will now reflect on what they have heard and on what may be possible. </p><p>  The European Union has always recognised that it would be very difficult to restart negotiations in the Middle East without the active engagement of the United States.   The EU will be working hard, accordingly, to encourage and support this renewed US involvement, in our contacts with the parties in the region and also in our exchanges with political opinion in the US itself.  I already conveyed to Secretary Kerry the strong encouragement of the EU and discussed the possibilities with him at a meeting I had with him in Washington on 18 March just before he left for Israel.</p><p>  As I have stated elsewhere, I also believe that the EU must remain active as well on the practical issues on the ground which we have highlighted in the last year &ndash; and which have the potential to destroy any political effort to reach agreement if they are allowed to fester.</p></reply>

This has led to the complete depletion of fish stocks in that narrow zone and thus the effective loss of one of the few natural resources available to people in Gaza. </p><p>  I therefore welcomed the extension by Israel of this limit to six miles, following the renewed ceasefire in Gaza in November, and I hoped for further relaxations in this regard.</p><p>  It is very disappointing, therefore, that in recent days Israel, in response to missiles fired from Gaza at Israeli population centres last week, both closed the border to transfers of goods and restricted the fishing limit once again to three miles.  It is to be hoped that these are temporary responses to a specific event and that they will be ended quickly.  I deplore, however, this apparent return to a policy of penalising the population as a whole for the actions of militants, a policy which I consider both unjust and counterproductive.  The militant groups in Gaza who fire these missiles have already demonstrated that they do not care very much about the impact of their actions on the population around them.</p><p>  Equally, I firmly condemn the action of firing missiles at Israeli towns with the express intention of killing civilians and spreading terror.  It is difficult not to conclude that, by doing so during the visit of President Obama to Israel, and as he spoke to revive Israel&rsquo;s engagement in peace efforts,  those responsible quite intentionally hoped to provoke a response against the people of Gaza and a setback to peace efforts.</p></reply>

My aim has been to ensure that we gain maximum mutual benefit from the Presidency.   </p><p>  The Irish Presidency and other EU-related matters featured prominently at most NSMC meetings, during 2012, particularly the Plenary, and Ministers availed of all opportunities to brief their counterparts on the Presidency priorities in their sectors.  This has continued in 2013 and Ministers used these opportunities to invite their Executive colleagues to participate in relevant Presidency events and a number have already done so. This positive engagement has helped to strengthen North/South cooperation, availing of the first Irish EU Presidency during an operational North South Ministerial Council.   </p><p>  Last October Minister of State Creighton briefed the EC-UK Forum in Stormont on Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency priorities at the invitation of Northern Ireland Assembly&rsquo;s Chairman of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM), Mike Nesbitt MLA. More recently, on 6 March Minster Creighton briefed the OFMDFM Committee on the work of the Presidency to date and on the plans for the remainder of the semester. Those attending included members of the NI Assembly Business Trust, which brings business representatives and Members of the Assembly together. During the visit she paid a courtesy call on the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr Willie Hay MLA and met the two junior Ministers in the OFDFM, Jonathan Bell MLA and Jennifer McCann MLA.</p><p>  Underscoring the European Union&rsquo;s continued commitment to Northern Ireland, I am pleased to report that following intensive lobbying by the Government and subject to approval by the European Parliament, the EU will be contributing &euro;150 million to a new PEACE programme.</p></reply>

My programme in South Africa was predominantly focused on strengthening economic and business links with Ireland.</p><p>  Tanzania and Mozambique are priority countries for the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  Our   programmes in both countries are focused on reducing poverty through improved livelihoods for smallholder farmers, more equitable and better quality public health services and improved nutritional status for women and children.  We also work in areas such as governance, gender equality and building systems of accountability which will ensure lasting development results for the poorest people and communities.  </p><p>  In Tanzania, I visited health centres and schools to see how Ireland's support for health, education and nutrition programmes are making a lasting difference in people&rsquo;s lives.  I also visited Dar es Salaam port, and a rural electrification project operated by ESBI, and I met with Irish and local businesses to discuss how we can continue to increase trade volumes between Ireland and Tanzania.  In Mozambique, I saw how Ireland&rsquo;s targeted development programme supports the poorest families to access education, basic healthcare and improve their livelihoods.  I also met with Irish and local business community members to see how the Government can best support Irish companies, including agri-businesses, to enter the emerging Mozambican market.  I visited Inhambane, one of the two provinces where Ireland focuses its support, an area which is now developing following decades of destruction in the civil war.  I saw important signs of change, including during a school visit, but also the serious challenges that remain to be addressed.  One of these is the scourge of HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases, including TB, which I discussed with our partners, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and during a visit to a health centre and a home based care organisation.  I also saw how Ireland is working in Mozambique to improve the capacity of the private sector to provide jobs and economic opportunities.</p><p>  In Maputo on 20 March, with the Foreign Ministers of Mozambique and Tanzania, I co-chaired, as the representative of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, the first meeting in five years of the political dialogue between the EU and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the political and economic association of 15 countries in the region.  We discussed the economic situation in the region, which is experiencing impressive economic growth, and the need for greater progress on trade liberalisation between the EU and southern Africa.  We also focused on important developments in the political situation in Zimbabwe, in the wake of the constitutional referendum, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar.  </p><p>  The meeting served to restore the official dialogue between the EU and SADC.  We agreed that Ministerial-level meetings will now be organised every two years, along with annual meetings at senior official level.</p></reply>

It is not the first time that allegations of chemical weapons use have been made in the current Syrian conflict. Reports concerning the use of a known chemical weapon appeared in December 2012 but have not been confirmed or independently investigated. We do not, as of yet, have any information relating to the reports of an alleged attack on 19 March.  UN Secretary General Ban announced on 21 March that he had agreed to undertake the investigation requested by the Syrian authorities.  The investigation team will include personnel from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Health Organisation.  The Director General of the OPCW indicated last Thursday that he had agreed to the request from the UN to provide assistance to the investigation, as required by the Chemical Weapons Convention in the case of allegations of use by a non-State Party.</p><p>  The mandate for the investigation will be finalised in the coming days.  Ireland believes that any investigation should consider all instances of alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria and I can assure the Deputy that we will support as comprehensive a mandate as possible.</p><p>  In addition, reference was made to this issue during a discussion of the situation in Syria which took place at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Dublin on Friday 22 and Saturday 23 March.  The Deputy will be aware that the European Union has previously expressed serious concern at the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria and that it has called on Syria never to use such weapons under any circumstances and to store its stockpile securely pending independently verified destruction.</p><p>  Syria is bound by the terms of the 1925 Geneva Protocol and by customary international law.  Any confirmed use of chemical weapons by it would therefore be a breach of its obligations. However, Syria is not State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which prohibits the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and obliges States Parties to destroy any stockpiles they may have in accordance with a strict verification mechanism.  Notwithstanding Syria&rsquo;s non-adherence to the Convention, the reported use of these weapons in Syria will need to be addressed at the forthcoming Review Conference of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which will take place in The Hague from 8 to 19 April.</p></reply>

We have repeatedly called for universality of the Treaty in national as well as EU statements and also through our participation in the New Agenda Coalition.  Ireland has also played an active role in promoting a Middle East free of all weapons of mass destruction &ndash; nuclear, chemical and biological.  We see this as a priority objective not just in terms of promoting longer term peace and stability in the region but also in terms of protecting the NPT, with which Ireland has been closely associated.   The NPT is acknowledged as a cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.</p><p>  In 1995, the Treaty was extended indefinitely in a package of agreements that also included a resolution on the Middle East which envisages a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the region.  It is important for the Treaty that this Middle East resolution is fully implemented.  At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Ireland brokered agreement on some practical next steps towards implementation, including a Conference to be attended by all States of the region.  This agreement represented the first real progress towards implementing the 1995 Resolution in the fifteen years since it had been agreed, and Ireland&rsquo;s role in this has been acknowledged.  Work is presently underway to create the conditions necessary for a Conference in Helsinki in which all states of the region, including Israel, can participate.</p><p>  Israel has never officially declared itself to possess nuclear weapons and draws a veil over its capabilities in this regard.  It is one of just three states which are not party to the NPT.   The Deputy can be assured that Ireland will continue to call on Israel and the two other states to accede without delay to the Treaty as non-nuclear weapons states and to conclude a full scope safeguards agreement with the IAEA.  </p><p>  The Deputy can also be assured that universal adherence to, and full implementation of, the NPT will remain key foreign policy objectives for the Government as we approach the next NPT Review Conference in 2015.</p></reply>

I am pleased to report that significant progress has already been achieved with the decision of 13 February last by EU and US leaders to launch negotiations in the coming months.  </p><p>  The EU and the US are two of the world&rsquo;s largest trading blocs and already have very strong trading and investment ties with each other.  The joint EU-US High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth, set up following the last EU-US Summit in November 2011, was tasked with identifying policies and measures to further increase EU-US trade and investment including a possible trade and investment agreement to support mutually beneficial job creation, economic growth, and international competitiveness.  That High Level Group issued its Final Report to EU and US Leaders on 12 February 2013.  The Report concluded that a comprehensive agreement that addresses a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributes to the development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual benefit of the various options which had been considered.  The Report therefore recommended to Leaders that each side initiate as soon as possible the formal domestic procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.</p><p>  In a joint statement on 13 February 2013, EU and US Leaders welcomed the Report&rsquo;s recommendations and confirmed that each side would initiate the internal procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. </p><p>  In this context, on 12 March the European Commission agreed a draft negotiating mandate which is to be presented to EU Member States for approval by the Council of Ministers in order to start negotiations as soon as possible, still during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council.  As Presidency, we will play our full part in achieving this objective. </p><p>  For its part, on 20 March the acting US Trade Representative, on behalf of the President, formally notified Congress that the President intends to enter into negotiations with the EU on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and to initiate negotiations no earlier than 90 days after the transmittal of the notification.</p><p>  Both the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity during our recent visit to Washington DC for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day to reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment, as EU Presidency, to work for approval of the negotiating mandate before the end of the Irish EU Presidency.</p></reply>

Officials of my Department work closely with State Agencies to promote trade and investment opportunities in this significant market.   The overall trend in trade with Brazil is very positive. Ireland&rsquo;s exports to Brazil reached &euro;256 million in 2012, up 58% on 2007.  Trade in services is also strong with Irish exports reaching &euro;257 million in 2011, an increase of 47% on the previous year.</p><p>  The promotion of strong bilateral relations with Brazil is a priority for Government.  The successful visit to Brazil last October by President Michael D. Higgins provided a valuable opportunity to raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile.  President Higgins had a very positive meeting with Brazil&rsquo;s President Dilma Rousseff during which they discussed the growing bilateral relationship, in particular as regards trade and education. The President also met with political and business leaders in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia.  In this regard, I welcome indications that both the Mayor and Governor of Sao Paulo have announced their intention of sending, respectively, a trade mission and an investment mission to Ireland in the period ahead.  Our Embassy in Brazil is following up with their respective offices.</p><p>  My colleague the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr Joe Costello T.D., accompanied President Higgins and led a highly successful Enterprise Ireland Trade Mission. Other State Agencies that participated included IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and Bord Bia. 42 Irish businesses and third-level education institutions participated and they were drawn from a wide-range of sectors including education, telecommunications, financial and engineering services.  During the Mission participants advanced their interests in a range of ways including by securing export contracts, opening facilities and putting in place Memoranda of Understanding with Brazilian partners.</p><p>  The Irish Embassy in Brazil and the Irish State Agencies work closely together on the promotion of Irish interests.  Earlier this month, the Ambassador and his team collaborated with IDA Ireland on an investment mission that took place in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  Plans are already underway for a further Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led mission to Brazil later this year which will focus on Education and Technology, and the Embassy is working closely with the Enterprise Ireland office in Sao Paulo in this regard.</p><p>  Officials of my Department both in the Embassy and at Headquarters will continue to collaborate closely with State Agencies, as well as with the network of governmental and business contacts that we have developed in Brazil, so as to provide effective support to Irish businesses and education institutions pursuing opportunities in this dynamic, high-growth market.</p></reply>

These included meetings with President Obama, Senators Leahy, Schumer, McCain and Isakson and with several leading members of the House of Representatives.  I also discussed the prospects for immigration reform in my meetings with Secretary of State Kerry on 6 and 18 March.</p><p>  The clear advice that emerged from these high level contacts remains that comprehensive reform is likely to be the only manner by which a resolution for the undocumented can be achieved.  </p><p>  The prospects for such reform have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  He emphasised his commitment to achieving a positive outcome in his inauguration and State of the Union addresses and during his meeting with the Taoiseach and myself on 19 March.</p><p>  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress are also encouraging.  Although work is underway in the Senate and the House of Representatives, full proposals have not yet been tabled and it is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale during which progress might be achieved. It is also important to recognise that immigration remains a divisive political issue and that achieving a positive outcome will be very difficult. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that this issue will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s closest attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

These discussions focussed on how the EU can best promote a peaceful resolution to the crisis and alleviate the sufferings of so many Syrians caught up in this violent conflict since March 2011.</p><p>  At the Council meeting on 11 March, my EU colleagues and I had a valuable exchange with the UN/League of Arab States Special Envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, who briefed us in detail on the current situation in Syria.  Special Envoy Brahimi was honest in his assessment and expressed the clear view that only a negotiated settlement can salvage what is left of Syria and offer the hope of an end to the conflict.</p><p>  At the informal &ldquo;Gymnich&rdquo; meeting last weekend in Dublin, EU partners reaffirmed their full support for the Special Envoy Brahimi in what he is doing.   We also made clear that the priority for the EU is to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis.</p><p>  Considerable attention has also been devoted to reviewing the current EU sanctions which apply against Syria.   We want to ensure through these measures that pressure remains on the Assad regime to stop its repression and to engage in a process of political dialogue with the opposition.  At the 18 February Foreign Affairs Council, we agreed to renew the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months, until 1 June.  At the request of the European Council on 14-15 March, we again discussed this subject at the informal meeting held in Dublin last weekend.   We agreed to continue our discussion at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April with a view to reaching a common position ahead of the 1 June renewal date.</p><p>  There is also a need to ensure full accountability in relation to the gross human rights violations and war crimes which have been committed by all sides to this conflict.  Ireland has been to the fore within the EU in supporting calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  In January we joined 57 other UN members in co-signing a letter sent by Switzerland to the President of the UN Security Council which called for referral to the ICC.   I also issued a joint statement on the same subject with my Austrian, Danish and Slovenian counterparts the same month.</p><p>  As a new member of the UN Human Rights Council, we have been active during the Council&rsquo;s most recent session in building support for a strong resolution on the current human rights situation in Syria.   This resolution, which calls for referral to the appropriate international criminal justice mechanism in the case of gross human rights violations, was overwhelmingly adopted by the Council on 22 March.</p><p>  The plight of millions of ordinary Syrians remains a growing concern for Ireland and its EU partners as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, in and outside Syria.  Ireland and its EU partners are making a major contribution to the UN-led humanitarian relief operations.   The EU is collectively the largest donor to such efforts, having contributed some &euro;600 million in aid to date.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance to Syria over the past year amounts to &euro;7.1 million.</p><p>  The conflict in Syria has been a major priority for Ireland and the EU over the last two years and will likely remain at the top of our foreign policy agenda during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. We will continue to use whatever influence we have in our Presidency role and at all levels of our international engagement to support and promote European and UN efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p></reply>

From 2004 to 2010, however, the annual recruitment competition was only open to the new Member States.  Since the reopening of competitions to all EU Member States, there have been a disappointing number of successful Irish candidates.  This decline in the number of permanent Irish officials entering the EU institutions is a matter of concern.  To address this problem a number of initiatives to promote EU career opportunities have been undertaken.  A stakeholders&#8217; group, the EU Careers Committee, has been established which includes representatives of the EU Division of the Department of the Taoiseach and of the Irish Permanent Representation in Brussels, as well as representatives of the Public Appointments Service, European Movement Ireland, the European Commission Representation in Ireland and the European Parliament office in Ireland.  The committee works in close cooperation with the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), the EU&#8217;s recruitment service.</p><p>  In addition, a public information campaign &#8216;EUJobs&#8217; has been launched, led by the Minister of State for European Affairs.  An online presence has been created to provide information and raise awareness about EU career opportunities.  This includes a website ; twitter @eujobsireland; and facebook EUJobs.ie.  A mailing list for those who wish to receive updates and advice has also been set up ( ).</p><p>  EU Careers Ambassadors been appointed in all Irish universities.  Third-level careers advisory offices have received information about working in the EU institutions.  The Minister of State for European Affairs and members of the EU Careers Committee visit universities and other third level institutions to promote EU careers and attend jobs fairs on a regular basis.  Training and advice is given to candidates at the various stages of application process for jobs in the EU institutions.</p></reply>

I have also discussed these issues in regular ongoing contacts with the party leaders in Northern Ireland, and most recently in Washington DC with the First and Deputy First Ministers.</p><p>  I think it is important to put right the view that there is a legislative vacuum around the flags protest.  This is not the case, as is illustrated by the fact that over 200 people have been charged with a variety of offences since the protests began. </p><p>  There is however an ongoing debate regarding the extent, if any, to which existing legislation needs to be strengthened to enhance the remit of the Commission in these matters.  There is no cross community consensus on this matter.  Indeed, some unionist community representatives, far from wanting the Commission&rsquo;s role extended, want it abolished completely.</p><p>  What is important at present is that where the Parades Commission has jurisdiction all parties cooperate with it and respect its determinations.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I are fully in agreement on this issue.  Furthermore, we are agreed that the police should be fully supported in their attempts to maintain public order. </p><p>  My understanding is that the current debate will be further informed by the outcome of the recent judicial review proceedings which have been instituted by a resident in the nationalist Short Strand Community in Belfast &ndash; an area which has been greatly affected by the flags dispute.  In the circumstances I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</p></reply>

We see it as a vital tool for promoting reform, democracy and stability in the Western Balkans and throughout Europe, and we are working to facilitate and advance the process for all candidates and prospective candidates. </p><p>  Of those countries who have submitted an application for EU membership, Croatia has completed its negotiations and is expected to accede to the EU on 1 July 2013. Iceland, Turkey and Montenegro are currently in accession negotiations.  Serbia and Macedonia are official EU candidates, but have yet to begin accession negotiations.  Albania has applied for EU membership, but has yet to be granted official candidate status.  Although they have yet to submit applications for EU membership, the December 2012 European Council Conclusions have reaffirmed the EU perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.</p><p>  As with any negotiation, it is difficult to put a timeframe on the eventual outcomes.  Enlargement is a conditional process, whereby prospective members can advance on their EU paths by fulfilling the criteria and reforms required for EU membership.  Each applicant is considered on its own merits.</p><p>  The accession process is the EU&#8217;s most concrete and effective policy for promoting peace, stability and democracy; the prospect of EU membership provides a powerful incentive for reform in applicant and potential applicant countries.<i></i> Regional cooperation<i></i>and good neighbourly relations are essential elements of the Stabilisation and Association process and, as such, are closely monitored by the Commission at all stages of the accession process.  The December 2012 Council Conclusions on enlargement made particular reference to the importance of good neighbourly relations among countries.  High Representative Ashton and the European External Action Service continue to facilitate a Dialogue between the governments of Belgrade and Pristina in an effort to improve relations between their two countries.</p><p>  The EU&#8217;s proposed Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 also includes provision for IPA II, the Instrument of Pre-Accession Assistance.  This is a continuation of the Instrument that has been in place since 2007 which assists candidate and prospective candidate countries in preparing for accession, including by way of institution building and adoption of the EU acquis.</p></reply>

In her opening remarks to the Council, High Representative Ashton briefed Ministers on a range of topics including the Iran 3+3 talks, the elections in Kenya and progress in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue.  France and the UK intervened on developments in Mali, Germany debriefed on developments in the DPRK and Belgium welcomed the agreement reached in relation to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Condolences were also expressed on the death of seven hostages in Nigeria on 8 March.</p><p>  The first formal item for discussion was Russia (which was also considered by the European Council later that week).  The High Representative reported on the outcome of the EU-Russia Political Dialogue which had taken place in Brussels on 19 February.  Ministers addressed various aspects of the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Russia, a strategic partnership which is buttressed by strong trading and energy relations but which is also increasingly characterised by concerns about Russia&rsquo;s fulfilment of its WTO membership commitments as well as about internal developments which have undermined political pluralism in Russia.</p><p>  There was also a brief discussion of relations with Japan in preparation for the forthcoming EU-Japan summit.  Unfortunately, due to the crisis in Cyprus, the tentative date of 25 March for the summit had to be abandoned; it is hoped, however, that the meeting can be re-scheduled at the earliest possible opportunity. </p><p>  There was a brief exchange of views on Iraq and it is expected that Conclusions will be agreed at a forthcoming Council.</p><p>  Under the Southern Neighbourhood item, we took stock of the situation in Egypt and Tunisia, against the background of major political and social unrest, worsening economic outlook and forthcoming general elections in both countries.  The latest developments in Libya were also discussed, including preparations for the deployment of a CSDP mission on border management. </p><p>  Finally, the situation in Syria was addressed over lunch, where we were joined by UN Joint Special Representative for Syria. Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. Mr Brahimi provided us with an update on the latest developments in Syria, including progress on his mission to create a basis for a political way forward linked to the Geneva Communiqu&eacute;.

Furthermore, Article 21c of the Treaty specifies that the EU shall work to &ldquo;preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security&rdquo;.  The EU&rsquo;s achievements in this regard were formally recognised when it was awarded the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize.  Over six decades, the EU has consolidated peace between former antagonists, exported stability to its neighbourhood and been the first regional organisation to make a tangible contribution to peace and security beyond its borders.  In this regard, the EU already plays a leadership role in the promotion of peace.  The European Commission currently focuses its activities on the root causes of conflict and the building of sustainable peace.  In addition to deploying instruments relating to economic development and social cohesion, the Commission concentrates on the rebuilding of critical state institutions plus transitional justice and reconciliation efforts.  The European External Action Service (EEAS) promotes peace at all levels, ranging from, for example, high-level mediation between Serbia and Kosovo (which is conducted by High Representative Ashton) to the work of a newly created EEAS team on conflict prevention, peacebuilding and mediation which provides training on early warning, conflict analysis and mediation and which is helping to build conflict prevention capacity in third countries.</p><p>  In combination, and in the spirit of the EU&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;Comprehensive Approach&rdquo; to crisis management, these various instruments and resources enable the European Union to make a decisive contribution to the promotion of peace.  Ireland is fully supportive of this work.  As Presidency, furthermore, we are contributing to the organization of a conference, along with the EEAS and the European Parliament, which will look at ways of strengthening the Union&rsquo;s internal and external capacities in the field of mediation, a crucial element in conflict prevention.</p></reply>

The country has been ravaged by a long series of violent conflicts and millions of innocent civilians have been killed, injured or displaced from their homes.  There have been systematic abuses of human rights, extremely high levels of sexual violence and rape, and widespread recruitment and use of child soldiers.</p><p>  European Union Foreign Ministers regularly discuss developments in the DRC and are working actively to support efforts to bring peace and stability to the country. </p><p>  Countries in the region are eager to prevent the fighting from escalating further and recently joined together under the auspices of the African Union, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the Southern Africa Development Community to sign a Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement.  The agreement calls on the authorities of the DRC to reform their security forces in order to re-establish the State&rsquo;s authority in the east of the country, as well as to carry out basic institutional reforms.  The countries of the region, for their part, pledge to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their neighbours.  The adoption of the Agreement was welcomed on behalf of the EU in a joint statement by High Representative Catherine Ashton and Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs. </p><p>  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has appointed Mary Robinson to oversee implementation of the peace deal.  I have warmly welcomed this development.  She is expected to travel to the region in the coming weeks to meet the leaders who signed the agreement and work closely with them to ensure that the agreements are implemented.  I believe her efforts will be assisted by the surrender of indicted warlord, Bosco Ntaganda to the International Criminal Court where he faces 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. </p><p>  Ireland continues to provide ongoing support in response to the serious humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  Last year Irish Aid provided over &euro;10 million in assistance to those worst affected in the crisis. </p><p>  Earlier this month a further &euro;3.8 million in humanitarian funding was announced by the Government.  Of this funding, &euro;2 million has been provided to the Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC.  This provides quick and flexible funding to UN humanitarian agencies and to NGOs on the ground and aims to assist nearly four million vulnerable people in the DRC.  The remaining &euro;1.8 million is being provided to Irish Aid partners, Christian Aid (&euro;450,000), Concern (&euro;450,000), Tr&oacute;caire (&euro;300,000) and Oxfam (&euro;580,000).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-28a.198.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032800061#WRJ00400"><p>Since its inception in 1974, Ireland&rsquo;s programme of official development assistance has had a particular focus on the continent of Africa.  Both historically, and in many cases up to and including the present day, African countries have been faced enormous difficulties, including food insecurity, poverty, protracted conflict, environmental degradation, weak government capacity, unequal global trading relationships, severe infrastructural weaknesses, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV/AIDS.  In an effort to help the countries of the continent confront these far-reaching challenges, we channel some 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance to Africa.  </p><p>  As the Deputy notes, some countries in Africa continue to face particularly acute challenges in terms of conflict and food insecurity.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian budget we respond quickly and effectively to needs arising from such emergencies as well as to the effects of natural disasters across the continent.  </p><p>  The international humanitarian system has undergone significant reform since the Asian tsunami of 2004.  Important lessons have been learned in the intervening period from the shortcomings in the international response and major steps have been taken to improve the effectiveness, predictability and accountability of the system as a whole.  Ireland has played an important role in this process in practical, financial and policy terms.  </p><p>  Together with a number of other like-minded donor countries, we have worked particularly closely with the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to put in place new systems to improve the way in which aid is delivered and to ensure that coordination on the ground is improved.  </p><p>  Central to these efforts has been the establishment of the Cluster System, which brings together different aid agencies working in sectors such as shelter, nutrition, water and sanitation.  Another important development has been the establishment of the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which is a pool of funding held by the UN and which can be released within hours of a disaster.  Ireland, which was one of the original advocates for the creation of this fund, has contributed almost US$130 million to it since 2006.  We continue to support these and other innovative policy approaches at UN level.  </p><p>  At EU level, there have also been improvements in coordination between Member States and the European Commission, which together constitute the largest donor of development assistance in the world.  The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, adopted in December 2007, commits the EU to working to provide an emergency response based on need and to upholding the principles of good humanitarian practice: humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality.  Under our EU Presidency, Ireland is currently chairing the Council Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Assistance and continues to work to enhance coordination and ensure a timely and effective response to crises. </p><p>  At home, we have also made a number of significant changes in how we respond to humanitarian emergencies.  A portion of our emergency funding is now pre-positioned with partner agencies for immediate release in a crisis.  This reduces red tape and ensures aid can be disbursed in the critical hours and days following an emergency.  In addition, we have developed a network of humanitarian stockpiles around the globe and close to zones vulnerable to natural or other disasters.  This means that emergency supplies can be airlifted at short notice directly to where they are needed.  We have also established the Rapid Response Corps, a roster of skilled and experienced volunteers who make themselves available to deploy at short notice to work in humanitarian emergency situations. </p></reply>

This follows a call on 31 December 2012, from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, for urgent and rational debate on comprehensive measures to address such crimes. She also welcomed the Indian Government&rsquo;s announcement that it would establish a Commission of Inquiry into public safety of women in New Delhi. </p><p>  &lsquo;UN Women&rsquo;, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women is active in India, and continues to push for the creation and implementation of laws, policies and programmes that provide real opportunities for women to exercise their rights as equal citizens of India. </p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that India underwent a Universal Periodic Review of Human Rights on 24 May 2012.  During this review, Ireland together with our EU partners, supported recommendations which called upon India to enact comprehensive reforms to address all acts of violence against women.</p><p>   At EU level, India&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union has been underpinned by the EU-India Strategic Partnership since 2004.  This Partnership has seen both sides commit to dialogues on areas of mutual interest, including human rights issues.  The latest EU-India Summit was held in New Delhi in February 2012 where, among other matters raised, there was an exchange of views concerning human rights. </p><p>  Ireland was elected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) for the period 2013-2015 in late 2012.  During our term at the HRC Ireland will work with partners, including India, on a range of matters of mutual concern and interest and will continue to urge India to ensure that the rights of all citizens are protected.</p></reply>

The High Representative / Vice President of the European Commission Catherine Ashton, and the Secretary General of the United National Ban Ki Moon issued statements condemning this attack &ndash; condemnations which I shared at the time, and continue to share.</p><p>  Again, I wish to state that I admire Malala Yousufzai&rsquo;s courageous efforts to promote the fundamental right to education and her efforts to achieve education for women and girls in Pakistan and other regions worldwide.</p><p>  On 7th  March my colleague, Minister for State, Kathleen Lynch met with Mr Shaigan Sharif Malik the Federal Secretary of the Ministry of Human Rights while at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, New York. During this meeting, the Minister of State raised the shooting of Malala Yousufzai and conveyed the shock of Ireland and the international community. In response, Mr Malik conveyed that this event had shocked the whole nation of Pakistan.. He assured the Minister of State that the Pakistani Parliament was acting on women&rsquo;s issues and considering legal reforms that would tackle minority extremists.</p><p>  At a recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on the 11th   March, Ireland together with our EU partners adopted conclusions which support Pakistan in upholding the rule of law and human rights.  Further to this, the Foreign Affairs Council also strongly condemned all acts of violence against women, children and religious minorities and urged the authorities in Pakistan to take the necessary action to protect the rights of all citizens and bring perpetrators to justice.</p><p>  At UN level, Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of expression and opinion.  In addition, as an elected member of the Human Rights Council (HRC) for the period 2013-2015, Ireland is fully engaged at the UN to ensure that these rights are protected.  Pakistan was also recently elected to the HRC for the period 2013-2015, so we will have the opportunity of working closely with them on a range of human rights issues.</p><p>  I am informed that Malala Yousafzai was discharged from Hospital in February and is recuperating from her injuries well. I am happy to say that she has returned to her education, having started school in Birmingham.</p><p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s exchanges with Pakistan, both sides have underlined support for the views espoused by Malala Yousafzai. Ireland and our international partners will continue to support equal access to education for boys and girls and urge the government of Pakistan to fulfil its international and constitutional obligations and protect all citizens&rsquo; rights.</p></reply>

The Ambassador and officers in the Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, have also been very active in pursuit of progress in this difficult case.</p><p>  The person named by the Deputy has been detained in Sri Lanka since 5 September 2007.  No charge was brought against him until 29 January 2013.  I am informed that at his trial on that date a sentence of one month was imposed. Subsequently, he was informed that he would be released on 12 February 2013. Based on this information his family made flight arrangements for him to return to Ireland.  Officials from the Honorary Consulate attended the prison on 12 February to be present on his release and to offer any possible consular assistance.  They were informed that the release would not go ahead and that further charges would be brought against him.</p><p>  As previously communicated to the Deputy in my response to PQ9267/13, I wrote to the Minister for External Affairs expressing in the strongest possible terms my disappointment and concern at the sudden manner by which the release was revoked and asking that the Minister act to ensure that all possible due process of law is afforded to the person named by the Deputy. Our Ambassador in New Delhi travelled to Sri Lanka on 20 February and personally delivered my letter to the Sri Lankan Minister for External Affairs. The Ambassador also made a prison visit to the person named on the same day. </p><p>  The Ambassador and another Diplomatic Officer in New Delhi again travelled to Sri Lanka last Thursday, 21 March 2013, and a prison visit was again made to the person named by the Deputy. The person named by the Deputy is being treated as a foreign prisoner which allows him some privileges including a better standard of food. He is in regular contact with his wife and lawyer and has not raised any issues about access to communication with his family or lawyer. Our Honorary Consulate in Colombo is also in regular contact with the prison and the person named by the Deputy to ensure that he is treated well.</p><p>  The Ambassador and the Diplomatic Officer also met with the lawyer acting on behalf of the person named by the Deputy and will remain in touch with him to ensure the Embassy is kept fully aware of any developments in the case and to offer assistance in making any representations to the Sri Lankan government which the lawyer thinks may be helpful.  The lawyer indicated that the Sri Lankan Supreme Court has ordered that all charges be dealt with by September 2013.  </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware from previous replies, the EU Delegation in Colombo is also pursuing this case on our behalf and we are in ongoing contact with them, including at Ambassadorial level.</p><p>  As the Deputy may also recall from my response to PQ55354, Sri Lanka underwent its Universal Periodic Review, or UPR, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on the 1st of November last year. In advance questions to Sri Lanka, Ireland raised the issue of legal safeguards for persons suspected or charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, stressing the importance of trials taking place within a reasonable time frame. Ireland also requested information on any actions taken or plans to begin a process of reintegration for those in detention following the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka in May 2009, or information on any plans to begin legal proceedings in accordance with due process against those in detention. Finally, Ireland recommended that the Government of Sri Lanka take steps to ensure that all detainees are afforded a fair trial within a reasonable time period.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be interested to know that on 21 March 2013, at the 22nd Session of the UN Human Rights Council, a resolution on Sri Lanka, entitled &quot;Promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka&quot; was adopted. Ireland co-sponsored and voted in favour of this resolution, which included a call for a re-evaluation of detention policies in that country.</p><p>  My Department will continue to take every opportunity to seek to discuss this case bilaterally with the Sri Lankan authorities and at international fora.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that all possible consular assistance will continue to be provided in this very difficult case and that my officials will continue to liaise with the family of the person named by the Deputy.  </p></reply>

We also work to ensure that countries affected by repeated crises are provided with support to prepare for, and reduce the impacts of, disasters.  In 2012, Ireland provided over &euro;100 million to support those in need of humanitarian assistance across the globe. This helped millions of people to survive through conflicts and through natural and man-made disasters.</p><p>  To ensure that this assistance is effectively programmed to be delivered to those most in need, we work in partnership with national governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations and European Union. These programmes and agencies which are in receipt of our funding are subject to strong appraisal and regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being achieved.</p><p>  I am also aware that Irish-based aid agencies and their partners operate in some of the most sensitive and insecure locations in the world. The Government strongly supports and promotes the efforts taken by many of these organisations to develop solid security management plans and to employ dedicated security professionals to help train staff and ensure that they are adequately protected during the course of their work.  </p><p>  We are also continuing to work with the members and observers of the D&oacute;chas Humanitarian Aid Working Group to develop a series of overarching professional standards for Irish aid organisations with respect to safety and security issues.</p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity again to recognise the heroic role played by the many thousands of Irish aid workers and their colleagues around the globe who are striving to save lives and to deliver humanitarian help to those who need it most, often under the most sensitive and trying circumstances.</p></reply>

Overall, Irish exports reached their highest level ever in 2012.   Merchandise exports to Europe increased by 3.2% in 2012, with notable growth in exports to Switzerland (37.5%), Germany (19.7%), Denmark (11.6%), Poland (11%), Great Britain (7.3%), Netherlands (7.1%) and Belgium (2.4%). Outside of European markets, there was significant growth in merchandise exports to, inter alia, Canada (24.5%), Mexico (24%), Saudi Arabia (20.1%), Japan (20.5%), Russia (19.1%) and India (15%). </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government Trade Strategy identifies 27 priority markets, including those with the best prospects for increased trade. Local market teams headed by our Ambassadors are in place in these markets and their work is overseen by the high level Export Trade Council, which I chair. My Department and Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy network will continue to prioritise our work to support the growth of Irish exports. This year eighteen Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions will take place to a variety of countries which have been identified as priority markets for Irish exporting companies in close co-operation with each of our relevant Embassies.  I look forward to leading one of these missions myself to Turkey from 7 &ndash; 10 April 2013.  </p><p>  Competence for the EU's common commercial policy, which includes the negotiation of international trade agreements, lies with the European Union, and as a matter of Ireland's trade policy, comes within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation, Mr Richard Bruton, T.D.  As I understand it, the negotiations with Canada and with India could conclude in the short term, the prospects of concluding negotiations with Georgia, Moldova and Armenia are promising, the negotiations with Japan are set to begin in April, and negotiations with the US could begin as soon as the EU Council of Ministers adopts the mandate for negotiations, which we hope can be achieved under the Irish Presidency of the EU.  I am keenly aware of the opportunities presented by EU Free Trade Agreements for Irish business and in this regard will continue to work closely with my Government colleague Minister Bruton in the framework of the Export Trade Council.</p></reply>

The deferred tax remains a charge on the property until the property is sold or transferred to another person.  Interest will be charged on deferred amounts from the due date of payment until such time as it is paid.  The daily rate of interest will be 0.011%, which equates to a rate of 4% per annum. The deferred amount, including interest, will be a charge on the property and will have to be paid to Revenue on the sale/transfer of the property.  If the property is valued between &euro;250,000 and &euro;300,000 the liability for LPT for 2013 is &euro;247 and if this amount was deferred for a full year would attract an interest charge of &euro;10.  The total charge as a result of deferral is dependent on the total LPT liability and the length of time of the deferral.</p><p>  As an alternative to deferral the person may opt to have it deducted at source from the pension at just under &euro;10 a week or the amount may be paid through any of the other payment methods by a family member.</p><p>  If the family member who raised the matter has any further questions s/he may contact the LPT helpline at 1890 200 255 or write to LPT Branch, P.O.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-28a.222.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032800062#WRK00900"><p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) sets out how the tax is to be administered and how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes.  Section 7 of the Act provides that voluntary social housing bodies will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.  Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  To avail of the exemption from LPT, the social housing provider must operate as a charity and must have a general tax exemption granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have had extensive contacts regarding the LPT obligations of social housing providers either directly with the providers themselves or indirectly through the Irish Council for Social Housing. Where a property owned by a provider of social housing is not exempt from the charge to LPT because it is not used to provide special needs accommodation, the Act provides that the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of zero to &euro;100,000 up to and including 2016.  This will result in an LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013 and &euro;90 per year for 2014 to 2016.  As the social housing body will be liable for the payment of LPT, it will be a matter for the bodies themselves to decide whether they will pass on the LPT liability to their tenants in the form of an increase in rent or whether they will absorb the liability without recourse to their tenants.

Section 7 of the 2012 Act provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, however, that residential properties purchased under the various local authority shared ownership schemes will also be subject to LPT and that the liable person in these instances will be the purchaser.  This is on the basis that under these schemes, the purchaser acquires a leasehold interest in the property for a period that exceeds 20 years.  Such a purchaser is in the same position as a property owner who purchases a residential property with a mortgage from a financial institution.  Accordingly, there is no reason why such an individual should not be liable for payment of the LPT on the property.</p><p>  As in the case of any other liable person, the LPT is based on the &ldquo;chargeable value&rdquo; of the property, which is the price which the unencumbered fee simple of the property might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market were that property to be sold on the valuation date in such manner and subject to such conditions as might reasonably be calculated to obtain for the vendor the best price for the property.</p><p>  I am informed by the Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessed tax.  In the context of the question put by the Deputy, it is a matter for the person who is purchasing a local authority shared ownership residential property to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property and to make a Return to Revenue.  As part of the general issue of LPT Returns which commenced on 11th March 2013, liable persons will also receive a Guide to Local Property Tax, which provides detailed guidance on completing the Return.</p></reply>

However, in Finance Act 2010, mortgage interest relief was extended up to the end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after (i.e. those who purchased in 2004 or after).  Accordingly, individuals who took out qualifying loans in the period 2004 to 2012 will continue to be entitled to mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.</p><p>  It should be noted that, where there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief, it is available at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings.  For example, individuals who are in the <i>first seven tax years of their qualifying loan</i> are entitled to a higher interest ceiling, on which the rate of relief is applied.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &#8364;10,000 per annum for a single individual and &#8364;20,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships.  For individuals who have an entitlement to mortgage interest relief and who are in their <i>eighth or subsequent years of their qualifying loan</i> a lower interest ceiling applies.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &#8364;3,000 per annum for single and &#8364;6,000 per annum for married couples/civil partnerships.  Therefore, some individuals will experience a reduction in the level of relief they receive as they enter into their eighth and subsequent years of their qualifying loans.  However, they will continue to receive mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.  </p><p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who moved in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.    </p><p>  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to amend the scheme along the lines proposed.</p><p>  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. </p></reply>

The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State.  This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based.  The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets.  The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged.  In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences.</p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will establish the regulatory framework for the licensing regime, was published in July last year.  Since that date work has been continuing by officials of my Department and Revenue on the drawing up of a number of amendments to the Bill to strengthen enforcement measures.  It is my intention, given the number of amendments, to go back to Government in the very near future for approval to republish the Bill.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the EU Technical Standards and Regulations Directive it will be necessary to show the published Bill to the EU Commission and other Member States, which could take 3 months for clearance.  However, I hope to use this time to progress the Bill through the D&aacute;il subject to scheduling agreement between the Whips.  The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.</p></reply>

The main form of criminality in this area is the laundering of marked gas oil whereby the marker is removed from the gas oil and the laundered product is then sold as auto-fuel.  As well as impacting negatively on the exchequer and on legitimate business, the laundering of marked fuel threatens the environment through the waste sludge that it generates.  In addition, laundered fuel can damage the engines of vehicles in which it is used.  Combating this activity is a major priority for Revenue and considerable success has been achieved in this area.</p><p>  Revenue officers have extensive powers to deal with this criminal activity, including the power to search premises and to stop, examine and search vehicles; take samples of mineral oil and question the owners or persons in charge of, or present in relation to, vehicles or premises.  Revenue officers have the power also to detain and seize mineral oil products and any vehicle in which such products are found.</p><p>  Revenue officers have powers of arrest where a person has committed certain mineral oil tax offences, for example, where a person, without the consent of the Revenue Commissioners, removes or attempts to remove, or is knowingly concerned in removing or attempting to remove, any marker from any mineral oil, or knowingly deals in mineral oil from which a marker has been removed, or to which anything has been added in order to impede identification of the marker, or keeps or has prohibited goods on any premises or other land or on any vehicle.  Revenue officers can raise assessments also on the amount of excise duty payable where they believe a person has an excise duty liability.</p><p>  In early 2011, in response to the escalation of the fuel laundering threat, Revenue strengthened the fuel-licensing regime for auto fuel traders, with effect from September 2011, to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  Following the enactment of new licensing provisions in the Finance Act 2012, this regime was strengthened further and a new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.  Under the provisions of the Finance Act 2012, Revenue also introduced new supply chain controls from January 2013.  These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  This information will provide assurance about the distribution of all fuels and identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and distribution patterns.</p><p>  In the period 2011 to 2012, Revenue closed 89 auto fuel retail outlets because they were unlicensed or operating in breach of licensing conditions.  In this period Revenue also seized over 2 million litres of fuel and detected and closed 20 oil laundries.  In view of the links between organised criminals and the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement agencies.  A Cross-Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, involving all relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland, facilitates co-operation among these agencies in dealing with the illegal fuel trade.  Arising from its work, a number of groups operating in both jurisdictions and involved in the production and distribution of laundered diesel, have been targeted for investigation.</p><p>  In addition, Revenue is working in close co-operation with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs on obtaining an improved and more effective fuel marker.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 2012 on a joint approach to seeking a new marker for rebated fuel and a joint 'Invitation to Make Submissions' (IMS) issued in June 2012 for this purpose.  The final date for submissions was 30 November 2012.  The IMS generated international interest and twelve submissions were received by the closing date.  These submissions are being evaluated at present.</p><p>  I am informed by Revenue that the effectiveness of the new rules will be closely monitored and evaluated.  If, as a result of this evaluation or due to other developments in this illicit trade, Revenue bring forward further proposals for additional powers then my record in this area shows that any such proposals will be given favourable consideration in the context of future Finance Bill provisions.</p></reply>

Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS).</p><p>  The document referred to by the Deputy relates to information compiled in 2004 by SESS at a time when teachers and schools were seeking information and greater clarity around Autism.  The reference to supervised training was included in a section of the document which sought to explain Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) as one of two main approaches at that time.</p><p>  My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism.  It is for this reason that the preferred policy is for a child centred approach based on the individual child's needs.  This approach is supported by ongoing monitoring of educational objectives to determine whether a child is benefiting from a particular intervention or range of interventions and to allow for appropriate adjustment to objectives and strategies.</p><p>  Reflective of the important role of CPD, my Department, through SESS, has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).</p><p>  CPD in relation to Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), within the learning and teaching context is provided by SESS as follows: (a) Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis (C-ABA) Course - this course provides an introduction to ABA for practising teachers in special education settings in Irish schools.  The course teaches teachers the skills to 'design, implement and evaluate' interventions to change the behaviour of students in their care.  Teachers attending this course are invited to avail of follow-up in school mentoring to enable them to apply the skills learned on the course.  Delivery of the course and subsequent follow up is supervised by an appropriately qualified person; (b) Post-Graduate Diploma in Applied Behaviour Analysis - three fully-funded places per annum are made available to teachers to pursue this Diploma in Trinity College, Dublin; (c) Applied Behaviour Analysis (on-line) Course - this is a 20-hour Applied Behaviour Analysis on-line course. It is available with full or partial funding; (d) Visits from SESS Advisors (Behaviour) Team - the team provides for school visits and telephone support for teachers in-school support and mentoring, following attendance at the C-ABA course.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p><p>  As home tuition takes place outside the school environment my Department's preference is that the tuition provider be a qualified teacher who is registered with the Teaching Council.  Where this is not possible approval may be given for a tutor with alternative qualifications to undertake the tuition and these details are available on my Department's website.  In such scenarios approval for nominated tutors is made on a temporary basis pending a qualified teacher being sourced. This tutor to whom the Deputy refers has been approved on a temporary basis pending a qualified teacher being sourced.</p><p>  The qualification standard required by the home tuition scheme reflects that required in a school environment.  Class teachers in schools are required to be fully-qualified with a qualification relevant to the sector in which they are teaching.</p></reply>

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or through a combination of these. Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.</p><p>  However my Department is mindful that greater clarity would be useful for schools and parents and accordingly my Department is currently in the process of preparing a comprehensive statement of existing policy within the boundaries of one document. Naturally the new policy statement will not be exclusive. Policies are subject, of necessity, to change from time to time. Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.</p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.</p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.</p><p>  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.</p><p>  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.</p><p>  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.</p></reply>

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation. However, many children with Down syndrome currently do have access to SNA support.</p><p>  In relation to the provision of additional teaching supports, pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months. </p></reply>

The maximum amount of worked days permissible for jobseeker clients is 30 days within the 12-month qualifying period. If a self-employed person is in receipt of jobseekers allowance and meet the criteria outlined above they can be considered for CE.

This fuel payment is an annual tax-free payment made to eligible people to help towards their winter heating costs. It is a lump sum and in most cases is paid automatically, but some people need to claim. The total amount of winter fuel payment can vary from &pound;100 - &pound;300 sterling having regard to age and household composition. Most payments are made between mid- November and December in a given year.  A person&rsquo;s entitlement to this payment is a matter for the authorities in the United Kingdom and my Department cannot advise on the eligibility of individual applicants.  My Department has made arrangements to publicise the eligibility conditions and application procedure for the UK winter fuel payment on its website and through the Citizens Information website. The information has also been made available via Twitter.   </p><p>  The implications of this ECJ judgment are currently being examined, in particular the implications for eligibility for the fuel allowance in Ireland which is paid on the basis that an applicant is unable to provide for his or her own heating needs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-28a.337.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032800067#WRP01500"><p>State pension reform is essential to ensure sustainability and to address the challenges of changing demographics including increasing life expectancy.  The abolition of State pension transition and the standardisation of the pension age at 66 from 2014 is part of a series of measures aimed at improving the sustainability of pensions in the future.  Growing numbers of people want to work or may need to work beyond the State pension age as people are living longer.  The abolition of State pension transition removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.  Recipients of State pension contributory can continue to work. </p><p>  There is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  In relation to the employment relationship, responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.   Enterprise policy and equality issues come within the respective remit of my colleagues, the Minster for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  An interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group was initiated to consider the cross departmental policy issues arising that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  The interdepartmental group, established in August 2012, is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, and includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children. </p><p>  The issues under consideration are the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues, employment and equality law issues; proposals regarding deferral of the state pension, and consideration of occupational pension issues.  It is expected that the Group will prepare preliminary proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers and present proposals to Government in the near future.</p></reply>

If this were to be increased by a further &#8364;50 a week, this would represent an increase of approximately &#8364;11.7 million on the Department&#8217;s budget for this year. This figure is based on the commencement date of this increase being the 1<sup>st</sup>  April 2013 and for the remaining 39 weeks of the year by an estimated 6,000 participating interns in line with the calculation below:</p><p>  6,000 (participants) x &#8364;50 (extra per week) x 39 (weeks) = &#8364;11.7 Million.</p></reply>

However, in view of the length of time which has elapsed since he was notified of the decision of the Deciding Officer, it is considered that the acceptance of an appeal would not be warranted at this late stage.  It would, however, be open to him to make a new application for invalidity pension to the Department and to have the matter determined afresh in the light of any changed circumstances.  If he is dissatisfied with the decision given in that regard, it would be open to him to appeal against the decision by writing to the Social Welfare Appeals Office stating clearly the grounds of his appeal.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

Any person, including individuals who are part-time fire fighters, who fails to satisfy these conditions, on an on-going basis, is not entitled to such payment. In this respect, Deciding Officers do not treat part-time fire fighters differently to any other jobseeker.  In applying the legislation, Deciding Officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality, the age and educational qualifications, together with the family circumstances of the particular claimant. A Deciding Officer will make a decision based on the individual circumstances of each case. </p><p>  Issues relating to the eligibility of fire fighters for jobseeker&rsquo;s payments have been raised with my Department on numerous occasions over the years. Taking account of the unusual circumstances of these workers and general efforts to develop and standardise the jobseeker schemes, a group was established in the Department to examine their position.  Issues in relation to fire fighters remain under consideration in the Department and key to these considerations will be recognition of the very valuable service which this group of workers provide to their local communities.  I will be in touch with Deputies in the coming weeks to advise them of the outcome of the Department&rsquo;s deliberations in this matter.</p></reply>

There will be a transition period over the next number of months with a view to putting appropriate arrangements in place as soon as possible (including legislative changes where necessary).  During this period the new governance model for the Digital Hub project will be fully defined and agreed.  A key priority in the smooth transition of the DHDA to DCC, is to retain its distinctive role in supporting the creation of jobs in the digital area.  The DHDA plays an important role in fostering the emergence of digital start-up companies, and the Department and DCC will be working to ensure that this role continues under the new arrangement.

This includes wind microgenerators and other technologies.  No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.</p><p>  ESB have indicated that they are currently 622 microgenerators (wind and other technologies) connected to the distribution grid, of which 550 are in Electric Ireland&rsquo;s Domestic Micro-generation Export Tariff Payment Scheme.  All Electric Ireland customers in the micro-generation scheme are domestic customers, as it is a domestic scheme only.  However, not all domestic micro-generators are on Electric Ireland&rsquo;s domestic micro-generation export tariff payment scheme, as they are with other electricity suppliers who don&rsquo;t offer such a scheme to their customers.  SI 201 of 2012 was introduced last year to provide for the refund of VAT paid by farmers on qualifying equipment, purchased from 1 January 2012, for the purposes of micro-generation of electricity for use in a farm business.  Again this is not limited to wind microgeneration.</p><p>  In 2009, the SEAI initiated a pilot microgeneration programme.  This involved 42 installations of various microgeneration technologies.  Monitoring of the installations took place and is now complete. A final monitoring report on the performance of the installations and learning from the programme is expected shortly from SEAI.  This will inform future policy development.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has also provided my Department with some initial analysis on whether microgeneration could be incorporated into the forthcoming Better Energy: Financing scheme (Pay As You Save) in respect of energy efficiency measures.  This will be further considered by my Department.  In view of falling technology costs, my Department has also asked SEAI to update analysis on the costs of varying levels of support for microgeneration technologies, with a view to considering how the sector could be supported in the future. I understand that SEAI has recently engaged specialist assistance in this regard.</p></reply>

The Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach.  Measures available include; draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.  These measures were selected for inclusion in the Scheme as they were deemed most likely to deliver energy savings to homeowners, at least relative cost, and would thereby optimise the use of Exchequer funds.</p><p>  Window replacement works are not eligible for support under the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.  I am advised, however, that grants for window replacement are available to those over 60 under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, operated by local authorities on behalf of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

The current quarterly and half-yearly payment options incorporate a surcharge element to cover the higher administrative costs involved in processing such applications.  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-year and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;20m.  Were a monthly pro-rata system to be introduced, the loss in income would have to be compensated for elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.  It would also have a negative transitional impact on the flow of income to the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund.</p><p>  Further, it is unlikely that the introduction of a direct debit payment option would lead to a reduction in administration.  An applicant would still need to apply for motor tax, a disc would still need to issue, renewal notices and reminders would still need to issue when tax renewal falls due.  There would be significant once-off costs in setting up such a system, as well as ongoing administrative, control and financial costs.  Any such proposal would require legislation to ensure that there is a system in place to recoup income lost to the taxpayer where there are insufficient funds in personal accounts to meet the payment or where the direct debit option is cancelled by the account holder once a disc is issued.</p></reply>

That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development.  The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development.

The Government has indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised and has asked a working group, at official level, to consider the balance of taxation and spending measures necessary to support this intention.  The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.</p><p>  Local authorities' cost and income bases vary significantly from one another.

I have also appointed four other Board members, who together with the Chairman, have the particular range of skills and experience to ensure that the public interest, and the interest of the affected homeowners, will be well served. </p><p>  Following receipt of the report of the independent Pyrite Panel at the end of June 2012, my Department and I engaged in extensive discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond resulting in their agreement to establish a not-for profit entity to operate a pyrite remediation scheme under the supervision of the Pyrite Resolution Board. I am hopeful that the entity will be established as quickly as possible and it will work closely with the Resolution Board in the delivery of an efficient and effective remediation scheme for homeowners. Appointment of Board members of the entity will be a matter for the three construction stakeholders who are setting up the entity and while staffing will also be a matter for the Board of the entity it will be the subject to discussion with the Pyrite Resolution Board.</p><p>  The Insurance sector did not engage constructively with my Department and did not express any willingness to be involved in a resolution process.</p><p>  My Department is engaging in preliminary discussions with a number of financial institutions facilitated by the Irish Banking Federation with a view to securing a loan facility which the not-for-profit entity would draw down to permit the earliest possible commencement of pyrite remediation works. The detailed negotiations with the prospective lenders on the terms and conditions of this facility will be concluded by the not-for-profit entity. The loan facility is intended to defray the costs of pyrite remediation work and ancillary costs only. </p><p>  From information supplied to the Pyrite Panel (March 2012), it appears that, in general, the pyrite problem is confined to five local authority areas, i.e. Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly. Seventy four (74) estates with 12,250 ground floor dwellings were identified to the Panel during the course of its work as possibly having pyrite problems. Of these dwellings, the Panel understood that approximately 1,100 dwellings have already been remediated or were in the process of being remediated at that time and approximately 850 dwellings had a claim with a guarantee provider. Taking a pessimistic view, the Panel concluded that the remaining 10,300 ground floor dwellings represented the maximum estimated future potential exposure to pyrite problems. Having regard to the robust methodology used by the Pyrite Panel in arriving at the above figures and the rate of presentation in Ireland, I believe the figures represent a reasonably accurate picture of the extent of potential exposure to the pyrite problem. However, the Panel also noted that not all dwellings in estates where pyrite has been identified will manifest pyritic damage and the reasons for this are detailed in the pyrite report. </p><p>  In December, 2012 the Government approved the imposition of a levy on the quarrying and insurance sectors as a mechanism to fund a pyrite remediation scheme as recommended in the pyrite report. Primary legislation is required to underpin the imposition of the levy and my Department is currently advancing the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for this. It is my intention that the Bill will be published and enacted in the shortest possible timeframe. </p><p>The purpose of the resolution process that my Department and I have been advancing over the latter part of 2012 is to provide cost effective remediation scheme for homeowners affected by pyrite who have no other avenues of redress. The establishment of liability is a matter for the Courts, and it is matter for homeowners themselves to decide if such a course of action is appropriate to their own particular circumstances.</p></reply>

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.</p><p>  To ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006. </p><p>  This focused review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise, proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts, as considered appropriate, as well as ways of building community support for wind energy development.</p><p>  The press notice - issued on 30 January 2013   &#8211; marks only the initial stage in that review process. It is essentially a pre-draft consultation intended to inform the preparation of revised draft guidelines. This early consultation allows for the public and other stakeholders to input into the process at an early stage. Other stakeholders that will be consulted include the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p><p>  All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for public consultation over a period of a couple of months. Once the consultation period is closed the submissions received on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines. The draft guidelines will &#8211; like all other new or revised guidelines &#8211; go out for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months. The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is Quarter 4 2013.</p><p>  Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development at the development management stage, including proposed development for wind energy purposes. For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 &#8211; 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission. Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road. Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. The site notice must contain the date on which the site notice is erected and state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the 5 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application. The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b></b>2 weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application. Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements, it may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.</p><p>  Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose. Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on its approved list of newspapers to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.</p><p>  In addition the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations. </p><p>  Any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.</p></reply>

The information sought in the Question is not held by my Department. However, between 2008 and 2012 my Department has provided funding of &euro;4,074,258 on an exceptional basis in recognition of the particular difficulties which arose for the local authorities concerned in responding to instances of illegal dumping of oil-laundering residues, particularly in relation to costs incurred by them in arranging for the safe disposal abroad of the hazardous materials involved. Both Louth and Monaghan County Councils have received the most significant levels of support with &euro;3,400,931 being reimbursed to Louth and &euro;620,599 to Monaghan during the years in question. In addition smaller amounts have been reimbursed to both Cavan and Offaly County Councils.</p><p>  I believe that a complete solution to this problem is difficult to arrive at and must necessarily involve more effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions, and these contacts will continue.</p><p>  I am also aware of enhanced co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies.</p></reply>

This is in line with the relevant recommendation in the report of the independent Pyrite Panel.  The methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage will be prescribed in regulations which are currently in preparation and will be finalised shortly.</p><p>  The primary route for homeowners to demonstrate significant pyritic damage will be in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, <i>IS 398 &#8211; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &#8211; Part 1</i>  . This standard provides guidance on the visual condition assessment, sampling regime and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage. The standard must be used for all assessments and testing undertaken on or after 29 January 2013.</p><p>  Where testing has been carried out prior to the publication of the above standard, it is possible that it may meet the requirements of the standard; however, there may be a requirement for some additional testing or interpretation of the test results by a geologist. In addition to assessing the test results, a visual condition assessment will also be required to be carried out by an engineer or other competent professional to confirm significant pyritic damage.</p><p>  To claim an exemption a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the liability date. The certificate will confirm that a visual assessment and relevant testing of hardcore material has been undertaken. Where a certificate confirming significant pyritic damage has issued in respect of a property on or before a liability date, that property will be deemed to be exempt from the LPT for a period of three consecutive liability periods.</p><p>  Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners getting relevant certification to claim an exemption. While homeowners who do not have the relevant certification on the first liability date of 1 May in respect of 2013, or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will have to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they have a relevant certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014. Additionally, homeowners will have the option to choose whether to designate 2013 or 2014 as the first of three consecutive liability periods for exemption if they get a relevant certificate before 31 December 2013 and make an election to the Revenue Commissioners specifying one of those dates on or before 31 January 2014.</p><p>  While I am conscious that the certification process necessary to confirm significant pyritic damage may appear onerous for the homeowner, it is, however, necessary having regard to the multifaceted nature of the pyrite problem. In this context, it should be noted that the Pyrite Panel alluded to the unpredictability of pyrite within an estate with even adjacent dwellings reacting differently, one showing damage and the other displaying no damage. This may arise due to different builders operating in an estate and/or as a result of multiple sources for the sub-floor hardcore material used. The Panel noted that not all dwellings in an estate where pyrite problems have been identified will manifest pyritic damage.</p></reply>

There are also 36 Garda Reserves and 34 Civilians in the Division. </p><p>  It is important to reiterate that the amalgamation of Districts will not diminish Community policing, which is at the heart of policing in Ireland - there are 96 Garda&iacute; dedicated to Community Policing in the Division. This has been consistently emphasised by the Garda Commissioner and his Annual Policing Plan for 2013 highlights the importance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working with communities to tackle behaviour that affects the quality of life of people throughout our cities and towns.</p></reply>

That submission is currently under examination in my Department, in consultation with relevant Departments and Agencies and the Garda Commissioner, and a reply will issue in due course when that examination concludes. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, and as highlighted in the particular submission, tackling illegal money lending requires an approach which goes beyond the criminal justice response to include matters concerning affordable credit availability, debt advice, debt solutions etc. </p><p>  The Deputy refers to work undertaken in the United Kingdom, under the auspices of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,  on the establishment of National Illegal Money Lending Projects in that jurisdiction.  As highlighted in the Interim Evaluation Report of these projects (2010) that work was undertaken as part of a wider strategy to tackle over-indebtedness and financial exclusion.</p><p>  The Deputy will therefore appreciate that responsibilities arise for a number of Departments in tackling this issue.</p><p>  With regard to the legislative framework in this area, the Deputy will be aware that legislative provisions relating to the regulation of money lending are provided for in the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  The regulation of licensed money lending is a matter primarily for my colleague, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority in this jurisdiction with regard to licensed money lending activity. </p><p>  Under the 1995 Act, unlicensed money lending is an offence. Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act. </p><p>  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, sections 10 and 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which provide for offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  </p><p>  With regard to the Deputy's question concerning the number of illegal money lenders that have been prosecuted and convicted each year since 2008, I have sought the information requested and will revert to the Deputy in due course.  </p><p>  As I have stated previously, I would encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.</p><p>  With regard to the question of any future initiatives in this area, as I indicated to the House, insofar as my Department has a role in this area and in the context of the investigation of illegal money lending,  I will give consideration to any proposals which might be brought forward in aid of the investigation of such offences.</p></reply>

Most support to the seafood sector is co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund and is covered by the Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013.  Financial supports for the construction, installation and modernisation of aquaculture enterprises are provided by BIM and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta through the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme.  This Scheme was originally part of the Irish Seafood National Programme, but was moved into the co-funded Seafood Development Programme in 2012, as part of a revision of that Programme following its 2011 interim evaluation.  As part of the original development of both programmes, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was conducted.  During the course of the public consultation on that SEA, the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland) raised concerns about the possibility of sea-lice emanating from salmon farms negatively affecting migrating wild salmon.  The Minister for Communication, Energy and Natural Resources supported these concerns.  Rather than delay the finalisation of the programmes, it was agreed to exclude salmon farms from financial support under the Irish Seafood National Programme until such time as the sea-lice issue has been satisfactorily resolved.  This temporary restriction on development grants was included in the text of the Irish Seafood National Programme (page 99).  While my Department has kept this matter under review with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the matter has not been resolved and the position remains that salmon farming is excluded from the financial support programmes for commercial aquaculture.</p><p>  With the transfer of the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme into the co-funded Seafood Development Programme in 2012, the text of that Programme was amended to provide for the continuation of the temporary restriction on financial support to the salmon farming sector.  The temporary restriction was also included in the eligibility criteria approved earlier this month for the next call for applications under the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme.  My Department's policy on sea lice controls is strictly evidence based.  The control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons: the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry; data obtained as a result of inspections is published; treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</p><p>  In 2008, the State introduced a new Pest Management Strategy, supplementing the control regime already in place.  This has resulted in a steady decline in average sea lice numbers on farmed salmon since its inception.  The protocols have been the subject of detailed investigation and testing by the EU Commission in response to a complaint from a member of the public in respect of the effects of sea lice on wild salmon.  On 11 October 2012, the Commission closed its investigation of this complaint in the State's favour following its examination of all relevant matters.  The Commission has also indicated that it regards the sea lice protocols operated in Ireland as representing best practice internationally.</p></reply>

Cattle are imported in very low numbers, with imports being mainly high value breeding lines such as prized bulls. Similarly, live pig imports into the EU are limited, with some very small numbers of breeding stock from countries such as Switzerland and Norway.</p><p>  No bovines have been imported to Ireland from outside the EU during 2012 or 2013 to date.  During this period, one consignment of 33 live pigs for breeding purposes was imported directly into Ireland from Canada.</p><p>  The importation into the EU of bovine and porcine livestock is subject to strict health conditions as laid down in specific EU legislation. In addition, the exporting country must be approved by the EU for export. The legislation in place requires that animals being imported into the EU  must undergo specific pre-export disease testing and adherence to specific conditions of preparation in the exporting country before being permitted to enter the Union. Such health entry requirements, which are generally equivalent to those applying to trade within the EU, must be detailed in documented health certification issued by the competent authority of the country of export.  Furthermore, such importations may only enter the EU through officially approved EU Border Inspection posts.</p></reply>

Leitrim at a site planted in 2009 with saplings from a consignment imported from continental Europe. The disease causes significant damage to ash trees and has spread rapidly in continental Europe, where it is now widespread in several countries.  </p><p>  Since October 2012, my Department has been carrying out a nationwide survey of ash forests which are known to have been planted with saplings imported from the continent in recent years.  My Department has also extended the scope of the survey work to cover ash plantations established since 1992 and are surveying AEOS and REPS plantings.</p><p>  In order to mitigate the risk of infected ash stock entering the country and causing further outbreaks of the disease, my Department introduced legislation on 26<sup>th</sup> October and 6<sup>th</sup> November 2012, under the <i>Destructive Insects and Pests Acts 1958 and 1991 (Chalara fraxinea) Order 2012 and Order no. 2, 2012.</i>   This legislation prohibits the importation of ash trees from areas known to be infected with the disease. Similar legislation has been introduced in Northern Ireland in order to implement an all-island approach to this problem.   </p><p>  This prohibition applies to all ash wood unless the wood is:</p><p>a) accompanied by a plant passport or equivalent documentation stating that it originates in an area known to be free from <i>Chalara fraxinea</i>  , or </p><p>b) squared so as to remove entirely the rounded surface, or</p><p>c) bark-free, with a water content less than 20%, or</p><p>d) if sawn, kiln-dried to below 20% moisture content.</p><p>  Before the above mentioned legislation was introduced, officials of my Department notified the European Commission and the other Member States of the first finding of <i>Chalara fraxinea</i> in Ireland. These parties were informed of the actions taken to destroy the material and of my Department&#8217;s intention to take emergency measures under the EU Plant Health Directive to prevent the further introduction of <i>Chalara fraxinea.</i></p><p>  The Department&#8217;s forestry officials continue to work with forestry contractors and the owners of affected plantations to remove the ash trees on all infected sites and replace the affected stock with an appropriate alternative species. A Reconstitution Scheme has been put in place   in order to provide the supports necessary for the forestry sector to remove and replace diseased ash stock from the national forestry estate.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is doing everything it can to address the threat posed by <i>Chalara fraxinea</i>   and in this regard, the Department is working closely with the authorities in Northern Ireland on an all island approach to the matter.</p></reply>

Dublin.  These are Trinity House School, Oberstown Boys School and Oberstown Girls School.  Under current arrangements, the children detention schools are authorised for detaining males under 17 years and females under 18 years of age</p><p>  In relation to staffing levels in the children detention schools, one of my priorities as Minister with responsibility for this area is the full implementation of the requirements of the Public Service Agreement on the Oberstown campus.  A significant step forward was achieved in this regard on 25 February 2013, with the implementation of a campus &ndash; wide staffing roster agreement to apply in all three children detention schools.  A key feature of this roster is the facility to deploy staff on a cross campus basis in any of the three children detention schools, on the basis of identified need.  I understand that this aspect of the roster has been implemented and I welcome the cooperation of staff to date.  One of the aims of this system is to ensure that adequate staffing levels are maintained, in that staff which may be surplus to requirements on a short term basis in any of the three children detention schools on the campus can be redeployed to one of the other sites where the requirement for staff may be more pressing.  Such flexibility of operation is a key requirement of the Public Service Agreement.</p><p>  I understand that notwithstanding the progress that has been made, there are some implementation difficulties which have been experienced recently on the campus with the new roster, including the need to address issues relating to rates of absenteeism and attendance management.  These issues are being managed by the Board of Management of the Oberstown campus, working with the Directors of each children detention school and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  However, I note that this is the first time that all three children detention schools have been placed on an identical rostering system and some difficulties are perhaps to be expected.  I have been advised by the Chairman of the Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service that these issues are being addressed as a matter of urgency.</p><p>  The Oberstown Board and the Irish Youth Justice Service, with independent assistance in line with best practice, have recently arranged for an examination of a number of claims relating to safeguarding and general work practices in Trinity House School.  This approach has been notified to HIQA and I expect that the Board will shortly be in a position to adopt a position on the matters raised, based on the need for fair procedures to be adhered to in all respects.</p><p>  I am also advised that there are a number of individual employee grievance cases on the Oberstown campus which are currently before the Board and the Irish Youth Justice Service, and that these cases are being urgently assessed with a view to having a complete resolution of them at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  The Directors on the Oberstown campus are responsible for the immediate control and supervision of each children detention school under the Children Act, 2001.  This role includes responsibility for compliance with all relevant health and safety requirements, subject to any general guidance that may be required in this area by the Board of Management.  I  am not aware of any specific issue which would raise concerns in this area and would expect the children detention schools to operate in a manner compliant with health and safety law and practice.  I note that the children detention schools are subject to inspection at any time by the Health and Safety Authority</p></reply>

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of publishing the Heads was to allow for a full consultation at an early stage in the developing the Bill. I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July 2012 and my Department has examined the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee. Among the many issues examined by the Committee were:</p><p>- The inclusion of emotional abuse;</p><p>- Inclusion of childminders as a named individual;</p><p>- Problems associated with appointment of a volunteer as a designated person including that it could deter people from volunteering;</p><p>- Concern about complexity and additional responsibilities placed on the Designated Officer;</p><p>- Issues surrounding identification of an 'organisational unit ' where the organisation is part of, or affiliated to, or federated to, a national organisation;</p><p>- Concern that legislation focused on reporting where this was not found to be the main problem in reviews of child abuse and child death cases;</p><p>- Capacity of HSE to implement legislation;</p><p>- Inclusion of reporting of  retrospective abuse</p><p>  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging need to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of both policy and operational issues as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives. In the regard,  my officials have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I met recently with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen. These discussions will inform the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.  </p><p>  It is my intention to submit further proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.</p></reply>

These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drug Task Force Projects and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, the European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &ndash; the Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award</p><p>  Funding of &euro;53.173m has been provided to my Department for the provision of youth services in 2013. Of this total funding, &euro;1.75 has been provided in a new capital funding programme for 2013.  </p><p>  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.  The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services.</p><p>  My Department notified all grant administering agencies of the 2013 funding allocations on the 19th February last.  However, in view of the reduction in funding in recent years due to the challenging fiscal situation, grant administering agencies/bodies, who administer the funding on behalf of my Department, were afforded the flexibility to make recommendations to my Department to reconfigure the allocations based on their local knowledge and expertise in relation to the projects in their respective areas.  In the case of Cabra Youth Service the City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), which is the grant administering agency for the Dublin City area, made such recommendations to my Department.  These recommendations were considered and approval was granted by my Department on the 21st   March.  I understand that letters in relation to the 2013 funding allocations have now been issued by CDYSB to the projects in the Dublin City area.</p></reply>

It allows for timely reviews and quick feedback to the system on changes required as well as identifying individual or systemic risks which need immediate action. The National Review Panel was established by the HSE on foot of guidance from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). The Review Panel is independently chaired by Dr. Helen Buckley, and is mandated to review all serious incidents involving children in care, to include deaths in care. While the group was established by the HSE it has an independent role and receives independent legal advice. The Panel produces and publishes reports that are entirely objective and independent of the HSE.</p><p>  My Department is currently in the process of reviewing the operation of the Child Death Review mechanism to ensure that it continues to operate effectively and independently, particularly in the context of the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency and the other existing institutional arrangements for client safety.</p></reply>

The necessary actions are being implemented as part of the Government&rsquo;s reform programme for children&rsquo;s services, the most radical reform of child welfare and protection services ever undertaken in the State. The integrated delivery of these reforms will ensure that responses to many of the ICDRG recommendations will be mainstreamed into the work programme of the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p><p>Detailed work is underway to implement the ICDRG recommendations as follows: </p><p>- Legislative Reform &ndash; in order to support the rights of children generally, and particularly those who require the intervention of child welfare and protection services, the Constitutional referendum on children was held in November 2012. Issues related to the in camera rule and child care court proceedings have also been subject to legislation.  The Child Care Act 1991 (Section 29(7) Regulations were made in November 2012 facilitating the public reporting of child care court proceedings by researchers. These regulations have facilitated an independent project under Dr Carol Coulter which is carrying out research, for publication, on child care hearings in the courts.  The Government has recently published the Court Bill 2013 to directly address issues related to the in camera rule.  The draft Heads of the Children First Bill were considered by the Oireachtas Committee on Health &amp; Children and the report of the Committee is being considered by my Department in the development of these legislative proposals.  Consideration is also being given to strengthening legislation regarding the provision of aftercare. I recently met with experts and representatives of organisations working with young people in care to discuss the approach. </p><p>- Organisational Reform &ndash; preparations are advanced for the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency.  The Agency will be an essential vehicle for ensuring the ethos of quality and accountability called for by the ICDRG is strongly reflected in children&rsquo;s services.  The Heads of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill have been approved by Government and drafting of this legislation is advanced.  Significant operational and industrial relations preparations have taken place including notification of almost 4,000 individuals of their planned transfer to new Agency.</p><p>- Operational Reform - A central feature of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework which will prioritise serious child protection referrals while providing for development of new &lsquo;Local Area Pathways&rsquo; which will involve a greater use of community-based services to address child and family welfare concerns in a timely &amp; effective manner.  Significant work has taken place in relation to this service redesign.  A group has been established in the HSE to work with the Irish Youth Justice Service on the needs of the most vulnerable youths, in line with the needs highlighted in the Child Deaths Report.   Work is progressing on development of a National Child Care Information System to comprehensively address issues of record keeping and data management.  The procurement process is now at contract stage.  The ICDRG highlighted concerns in relation to social worker assignment and care planning. As of Quarter 4 2012, data indicates that 92% of the total children in care population had an allocated social worker.  There has been a significant improvement in recent years noting that as recently as 2009, for example, some 17% of children in care did not have a social worker.  In the case of children in special care and high support facilities, 100% had allocated social workers.   87.6% of the total children in care population had a written care plan as defined by the Child Care Regulations, 1995.  In the case of children in special care and high support facilities, 100% had written care plans.  Two out-of-hours pilot projects in Donegal and Cork were commenced and independently evaluated. The HSE has reviewed the Evaluation Report and prepared a business case for a National Out of Hours Social Work Service. The HSE is in discussion with relevant staff representative associations.</p><p>- Workforce Development - this Government completed the recruitment of 260 additional social workers proposed in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan. Over 1,400 social workers are employed in Children and Family Support Services and the introduction of 260 additional social workers represents a significant strengthening of the workforce.   Arrangements for the induction, training and supervision of these staff have been put in place.  Support for all staff includes the introduction of national guidance, such as Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook, and supervision of the implementation of this guidance.</p><p>- Oversight - Last July, I launched the first-ever HIQA &lsquo;National Standards on Protection and Welfare of Children&rsquo;. HIQA recently announced the commencement of inspections of child protection services, in line with new standards. Meanwhile 10 cases identified in the ICDRG report have been referred for independent review under Dr. Helen Buckley.  One of these reviews has already been completed.  Specific work is proceeding in relation to the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendations regarding mechanisms for the independent review of child deaths.  It is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements are developed in a manner that is fully consistent with the major organisational reforms currently in train including the transfer of child protection services from the HSE to the CFSA and the recent expansion of HIQA&rsquo;s inspection regime to cover all child protection services.  My Department has also consulted with colleagues in the North in order to share learning from the respective approaches to child death review.</p><p>  I trust these details illustrate the seriousness with which the ICDRG report is being advanced.  Finally, my Department has also used the detailed research undertaken in the report to highlight more general policy issues across Government, including for example discussions on the preparation of a National Substance Misuse Strategy, which is expected to be considered by Government shortly.</p></reply>

My Department administers a National Lottery Discretionary Fund from which small once-off grants are paid to community and voluntary organisations, providing a range of health related services. If an organisation wishes to make an application for National Lottery Funding they should send in a formal application. Detailed procedures, along with the application form are set out on the Department's website - www.doh.ie.  The HSE receives an annual capital allocation for the building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.   There are always more construction projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's capital health care allocation. The HSE is required to prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs of completion over the period.  The method and timescale for the delivery of health care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors; it is a dynamic process constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in 2010 the Department of Health published Palliative Care for Children with Life-limiting Conditions in Ireland &ndash; a National Policy (DoH 2010) which provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families, across all care settings.Following on from the publication of the policy, the National Development Committee for Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care (NDC) was established by the HSE. The NDC is co-chaired by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation. It includes a representative from my Department. The Committee has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the national policy recommendations. The committee&rsquo;s emphasis on partnership is reflected in its membership comprising statutory, voluntary, professional, and parent involvement.</p><p>  On 4 March 2013, the Irish Hospice Foundation and LauraLynn, Ireland&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospice, in partnership with the HSE published a report titled &quot;Respite Services for Children with Life-limiting Conditions and their Families in Ireland &ndash; A Needs Assessment&quot;.  The report provides a national overview of service provision and future respite requirements as part of a palliative care service for children in Ireland. The report identifies some of the challenges involved in planning for respite care such as difficulties with definitions and terminology; determining the numbers of children who require respite care and the numbers currently availing of services; the extent and location of current service provision; the perhaps at times unnecessary distinction between disability services and palliative care.</p><p>  The report provides an indication of what is currently available and what is required at a national level to provide for the respite needs of children and families. The report acknowledges that a significant level of respite support is already being provided but access is inconsistent around the country and can be dependent on diagnosis and/or geographic location. </p><p>  The report will assist the Department of Health and the National Development Committee for Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care in planning for the respite needs of children with life-limiting conditions, and is a useful contribution to filling in the gaps in the understanding and knowledge of the way respite services for children are organised. A number of the recommendations in the report are already under consideration by the National Development Committee and the Committee has undertaken to examine all of the recommendations through its on-going programme of work.</p></reply>

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate.</p><p>  Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to ED, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor ED activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity.</p><p>  Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target. The SDU and the Patient Safety &amp; Quality Directorate in the HSE are currently in communication to agree a mechanism of capturing and responding in instances where a Hospital reports one or more patients breaching 24 hours on a trolley on one or more occasion.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

I have stated that I am willing to enter into discussions about a health care package on a non-statutory basis; an ex-gratia payment having regard to current financial circumstances; and a statement to the D&aacute;il recognising the challenges faced by survivors.  </p><p>  There are two thalidomide representative organisations.  The largest group, the Irish Thalidomide Association announced publicly in 2012 that it had ceased talks with the Government. The Association's legal advisor has initiated personal injuries claims against the manufacturer and distributors of the Thalidomide drug and the State.</p><p>  The second organisation, the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society, has sought an independent agency and a statutory health care package including other aspects of their needs such as housing, heating, transport and clothing, which are outside the remit of the health sector.  My position remains unchanged from that outlined in my letter to the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society in June last year in which I requested that the Society consider, in good faith, proceeding with a Health Care Protocol which envisaged appointing and training a multi-disciplinary team, arranging a multi-disciplinary health evaluation, identifying and documenting their healthcare needs/issues and developing plans to address those needs.  I met with both organisations in July 2011 and have been in correspondence since.  </p><p>  There are currently 32 Irish Thalidomide survivors.  Each survivor received lump sum payments from a German Foundation and the Irish Government in the early 1970s.  In 1975 the lump-sums paid by the Irish Government ranged from &euro;6,400 to &euro;21,000.  In addition, each survivor receives on-going monthly payments from both the German Foundation and the Irish Government.  Combining the Irish and German payments, most individuals receive &euro;30,386 per annum or &euro;2,572 per month, tax free.  The German and Irish monthly allowance is not reckonable for State benefits and each individual is automatically entitled to a medical card.</p></reply>

Additionally, &euro;31,032.50 of Free Travel Pass (FTP) funding has been allocated to WCRT from January to June 2013, with a further proposed allocation of &euro;31,032 from July to December 2013.  This represents a total 2013 allocation of combined RTP and FTP funding of &euro;322,262.50 for the provision of RTP services in West Cork. </p><p>  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making  the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  </p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.  </p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. </p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding West Cork or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   </p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.    </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-28a.696.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032800084#WRGG01200"><p>Ireland is already well serviced in terms of ferry connectivity as the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime links in and out of the State.  There are currently six shipping lines providing passenger services, with approximately 500 sailings weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe, depending on the time of year.  All ferry companies servicing these routes are commercial companies and, as such, their services are market driven. </p><p>  My Department through its agency, the IMDO, works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services.  Any new services must be market driven.  Competition in the sector is encouraged and to date ferry operators have responded to market developments and increased capacity, when required. </p><p>  While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air, research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to our tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more and they tend to spend more than those arriving by air.  Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a particularly important year for Irish tourism with The Gathering Ireland 2013 now underway and over 3,000 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website.  The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013.  Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering and in this regard the agency is undertaking co-operative activity with the ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer.  This activity will continue through 2013.</p></reply>
