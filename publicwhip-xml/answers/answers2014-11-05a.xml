    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-05a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110500068#WRA00600"><p>Under section 43 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 the Minister for Finance may issue certain Government securities with a condition that both the capital of and the interest on any such security is exempt from income tax or corporation tax. This exemption applies only where the security is in the beneficial ownership of a person or persons who is, or are, not resident in the State. Up to 3 February 2010, this exemption applied where the security was held in the beneficial ownership of a person or persons who were not ordinarily resident in the State. </p><p>  The functions of the Minister for Finance relating to borrowing and debt management were delegated to the NTMA by order of the Government made under the NTMA Act 1990.</p><p>  The exemption does not apply to securities acquired by a company after 29 January, 1992, regardless of when such securities were issued, where the securities are held by or for an Irish branch or agency of the company and the trade or business being carried on through that branch or agency is a financial trade or business. The securities must be held by or for the Irish branch or agency. If they are held by the foreign company separately from its Irish branch or agency, the exemption continues. </p><p>  The provision is meant to incentivise persons abroad to invest in Irish securities. If the bonds were taxed at source, non-resident investors would almost certainly make it more expensive and adjust the price they are willing to pay to reflect the tax, so the tax gained would largely be offset by higher funding costs for the State. The exemption avoids persons that are not resident in this State and holding a beneficial ownership in securities issued by the NTMA on behalf of the Minister for Finance, being liable to taxation in both their home State and in Ireland. In the absence of the provision - which has been on the statute book in one form or another almost since the foundation of the State - such persons would be liable to be taxed in their own jurisdiction and in Ireland on the capital and/or the interest. </p><p>  While the percentage of Irish Bonds held by non-residents declined during the financial crisis, the fact that the State's sovereign borrowings increased substantially in the period resulted in an increase in the tax foregone figure from &euro;240.8 million in 2007 to an estimated &euro;615.9 million in 2012. This is borne out by the CSO published figures on national debt interest payments to non-residents which increased from &euro;1,347 million in 2007 to &euro;4,635 million in 2013, an increase of 244% over 2007. It is of course important to remember the benefits of this exemption in terms of incentivising foreign investors to invest in Irish securities.</p><p>  The register of holders of Irish Government bonds is maintained at the Central Bank of Ireland. The register is almost entirely made up of Euroclear Bank, the clearing and settlement platform. Due to the nominee account structure in Euroclear Bank it is not possible to identify the number of beneficiaries under the exemption provided for by section 43 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-05a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110500068#WRA00800"><p>In recognition of the fact that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by knowledge-based investment which is related to research and development and intellectual property, putting in place an attractive tax offering for intangible assets is key for Ireland's success in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).  This is why as part of my Budget announcement I made a clear statement of my intention to introduce a competitive income-based regime for intangible assets in Ireland, in what will be known as a "Knowledge Development Box" or "KDB".  </p><p>  I view this as a positive measure for Ireland and I will ensure the Irish KDB will be among the best in class on offer internationally.  The design of this measure will be along the lines of patent boxes which have existed for many years in countries that compete with us for FDI. </p><p>  At present, the measures that are in place in our competitor locations are the subject of on-going discussions at the OECD and EU level, as regards to their compatibility with the international rules around fair tax competition.  Until these discussions have been concluded, it is clear that it is not possible to guarantee that any of the measures in our competitor jurisdictions are sustainable and that they won't be changed in the very near future.</p><p>  In Ireland, we have always been clear on the need for certainty in the Irish corporation tax offering.  For this reason, we will await the outcome of these international discussions before we will legislate for the KDB and therefore make sure that the Irish provisions will be sustainable in the long-term.  The timeline for this process is not set in stone, but I intend to legislate for implementation in Finance Bill 2015. </p><p>  In the meantime, later this year, I will launch a public consultation on how the Irish KDB should operate.  This will gather views from as broad a spectrum as possible on what this measure should entail, and ensure that the process of introducing and implementing the KDB will be well advanced by the time the international negotiations are concluded.</p><p>  As a small country with a stable annual Budget and Finance Bill process, Ireland has a strong track record for being a fast-follower and for implementing timely tax legislation once international rules have been agreed.  This will also be the case for the Knowledge Development Box and along with the recent enhancements to Ireland's existing regime for intangible assets, it should give confidence to companies who wish to put their knowledge-based capital in Ireland.</p></reply>

The objective of these supports is to assist households in the country who pay their Water bills. </p><p>  Following on from the announcement on Budget day, officials from my Department are working closely with their colleagues in the other relevant Departments and Agencies, in the development of the processes that will be employed to deliver the relief. </p><p>  As I stated on Budget day and subsequently, we will design the measure as broadly and efficiently as possible, to ensure that the relief reaches all households who pay their charges.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-05a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110500068#WRA01200"><p> As the Deputy will be aware, my officials conducted a review of the Special Assignee Relief Programme in advance of this year's Budget. The review analysed aspects of the scheme such as the background and rationale for the programme and data available from the Revenue Commissioners including the cost and take-up of the programme. In addition, a public consultation was held. A report was written on the review and this has been published on the Budget website.</p><p>  Having considered the outcome of the review and Ireland's need to attract FDI, I have decided to:</p><p>  - extend and enhance SARP for a further three years until the end of 2017;</p><p>  - The upper salary threshold is being removed to encourage senior decision makers to come to Ireland;</p><p>  - The residency requirement has been amended to only Irish residency. This was proving to be a barrier to individuals in their year of arrival into Ireland, and also for individuals from countries where they are deemed to be permanently tax resident; and</p><p>  - The requirement to have been employed abroad by the same employer for 12 months prior to being assigned to Ireland has been reduced to 6 months in order to align with recent changes to employment permit legislation.</p><p>  I believe these measures are a positive step forward as part of a range of measures, forming the Roadmap to secure Ireland's place as a destination for the best and most successful companies in the world. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that this Government is committed to job creation. A key part of this focus is to attract FDI into Ireland, and in order to support and drive this job creation, it is important that Ireland can attract and retain the decision makers and senior executives who make such investment decisions. I believe that this measure will help to create jobs and support the export led recovery in the economy by maintaining Ireland's competitiveness for attracting FDI and the subsequent job creation that follows investments of this type.</p></reply>

Officials from my Shareholding Management Unit and our financial advisors, JP Morgan Cazenove, are well placed to fulfil this role and achieve the optimum outcome for the taxpayer as part of this process. </p><p>  In line with the rules set out for the SSM comprehensive assessment and stress tests, Permanent TSB's performance, and that of some other banks, was negatively impacted as a result of not having a Restructuring Plan approved before 31 December 2013. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-05a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110500068#WRA01600"><p>At the outset I would like to say that I am aware of the difficulties that the liquidation of Setanta Insurance Company Limited has caused for Setanta policyholders and those claiming compensation under Setanta insurance policies.   </p><p>  You will appreciate that a liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex and time consuming process.  The Setanta Liquidator is currently examining a range of factors in order to estimate the cost of claims and the extent to which claims can be met in the Setanta liquidation.   </p><p>  The Liquidator has advised that settlements can only be paid out after all of the company's liabilities are quantified, including claims. </p><p>  The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) provides for payments to meet the liabilities of insolvent insurers in certain cases where it is unlikely that claims can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  Under the Insurance Act 1964 claims by bodies' corporate or unincorporated bodies are not covered by the ICF, except where there is a liability to or by an individual.  In addition, all ICF payments are subject to a limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  Management and administration of the ICF is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  </p><p>  I am pleased to say that I have been informed that having sought legal advice on the operation of the legalisation, the Accountant is now satisfied that it is appropriate to make applications to the ICF for compensation prior to the completion of the liquidation of Setanta. </p><p>  Every effort is being made to ensure that claims can be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. The Accountant of the Courts of Justice is in ongoing discussions with both the Setanta Liquidator and his legal advisors to put in place appropriate mechanisms to commence making applications to the High Court in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964. In tandem with this he is also working to acquire the necessary skilled resources to enable applications to the ICF to be processed effectively and efficiently. Due to the unprecedented nature and scale of the Setanta insolvency the Accountant is not yet in a position to provide a timetable for applications to be made to the Fund, but it is hoped that applications by the Accountant to the High Court can begin sooner rather than later. </p><p>  Current estimates indicate that the shortfall for most Setanta claimants will be relatively small once they have received the 65% compensation available from the ICF as well as their distribution from the Liquidation. I understand that there is the very small number of large claims where the maximum ICF payment of &euro;825,000 will apply. However it is important to note that this estimate is based on an evaluation of claims reserves by the Liquidator. Actual claims experience may decrease the amount available for distribution by the Liquidator.</p><p>  I appreciate that the current uncertainty regarding the timing of compensation payments is causing difficulty for the former customers of Setanta Insurance and I have asked that information on ICF procedures is made available publicly as soon as possible. The Accountant of the Courts of Justice can only deal with claims which are submitted by the Liquidator, so the advice to all claimants continues to be that they should contact the Liquidator of Setanta.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-05a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110500068#WRA01800"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for Revenue. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes on-going analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved by Revenue through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  Revenue cooperates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the on-going programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p><p>  Revenue's action against the illegal trade has resulted in significant seizures of illicit products, and in a large number of convictions of persons involved in the smuggling or sale of illicit products. To the end of September 2014 49.6 million cigarettes were seized in 4,535 separate seizures, while 9,320 kilogrammes of tobacco were seized in 760 separate seizures.  This includes a major seizure in Drogheda in June 2014 in which officers from Revenue's Customs Service, supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, seized over 32 million cigarettes and 4,500 kilogrammes of water pipe tobacco.  </p><p>  I have taken legislative action over recent years to further strengthen the Revenue Commissioner's powers to respond to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade.</p><p>  - The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products.</p><p>  - The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offences and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production. Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production. That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.</p><p>  - The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.</p><p>  In relation to the allocation of human resources, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on action against the illicit trade in tobacco products. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. There front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection. </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009. Revenues overall staff levels have decreased from a total of 6,581 full-time equivalents at the end of 2008 to the current level of 5,680. Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000, so that they now represent a larger proportion of Revenue's staff. The Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to the tackling of the illicit tobacco trade and they are committed to ensuring that, despite the staffing reductions, this enforcement work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>  Finally, I would point out that the annual survey conducted for the Health Services Executive and the Revenue Commissioners by Ipsos MRBI indicates that 11% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2013 were illicit. The survey results for 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 indicate a level of illicit cigarettes of 15%, 14%, 14% and 13% respectively.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. I assume the Deputy is referring to the &quot;Group thresholds&quot; for CAT.<br/><br/>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free thresholdknown as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<br/><br/>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<br/><br/><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br/><br/><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer, other than one covered by Group A.<br/><br/><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, </b>applies in all other cases.<br/><br/>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. These thresholds have been reduced in recent years as part of the effort to restore the public finances as taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<br/><br/>The property market continues to improve with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country though not to the same extent in terms of price rises. I recognize, of course, that there are supply issues in certain areas of the Dublin property market. <br/><br/>The Group tax-free thresholds are kept under review, in the same way as other relevant tax provisions, and in this regard I will bear the Deputy's comments in mind for the future.</p></reply>

If the true relationship between parties is that of an employer/employee then the employer is required, under the Tax Code, to operate PAYE on payments made to the employee. If, however, the true relationship is not that of an employer/employee then, where the relationship relates to construction operations, as defined within the Tax Code, there is a requirement to operate the relevant RCT provisions. These provisions were placed on an electronic platform with effect from 1 January 2012.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the eRCT system is working efficiently and that it has removed substantially the vulnerabilities for fraud, mainly from bogus documentation, that attached to the previous paper based relevant contracts tax system.

The Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals' is not a Revenue Code but rather was compiled with the assistance of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions / Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation / National Employment Rights Authority / Department of Social Protection / Department of Finance / Small Firms Association / Irish Business and Employers Confederation / Construction Industry Federation / Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to tackling all forms of shadow economy activity including that which is described as 'bogus self-employment status'.  Their staff carry-out visits to a wide range of businesses, including temporary places of business such as building sites, as part of their on-going compliance operations. In some instances, such visits are undertaken jointly with other State agencies such as the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority.</p></reply>

The Central Bank measures, as set out in the consultation document, would place restrictions on the loan to value (LTV) and loan to income (LTI) ratios banks can apply when lending for house purchase. They would apply to all mortgage lending in Ireland by regulated firms. The Central Bank has indicated that the primary objective of these measures is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to try to reduce the risk of bank credit and housing price spirals from developing in future. </p><p>  The specific measures proposed for principal dwelling houses are to:</p><p>  - restrict new lending to a limit of 80% of the value of the property;</p><p>  - restrict new lending to a maximum of 3.5 times gross income.    </p><p>  However, the Central Bank has also stated that banks will be able to lend, in some instances, above these threshold limits. However, any lending in excess of the loan to value ratio must be limited to no more than 15% of the value of new loans issued and, in respect of exceeding the loan to income ratio, to no more that 20% of the value of new loans.  Other exemptions will also be available in certain circumstances. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2015 contains a number of measures to support a functioning housing market. In particular, in order to support first time buyers to save towards a deposit for their first home, DIRT will be refunded in respect of savings up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price. This measure will run until the end of 2017.</p><p>  My Department is also committed, under the Construction 2020 strategy, to examine the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme and how it might benefit new housing completions in the Irish market. The objective of any such scheme would be to help ensure the adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions, particularly for 'First Time Buyers', as the economy recovers. Of particular interest would be the means by which such schemes can support greater levels of investment in new housing, with the associated benefits for the construction sector and ultimately for the consumer. To further assist the evaluation and consideration of such a measure, I have recently written to the Chairperson of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform. I have asked the committee to consider the matter of mortgage insurance in an Irish context and, drawing on the experiences of other countries, to prepare a report on the issue.</p></reply>

Taken in conjunction with first quarter data, GDP grew by 5.8 per cent in the first half of this year. The increase in economic activity is broad based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.</p><p>  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with employment increasing in each of the last seven quarters, representing an increase of over 70,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 11.1 per cent in September, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012.</p><p>  Macroeconomic forecasts for the years 2014 to 2018 were presented by my Department on Budget Day, 14 October. They see GDP growth of 4.7 per cent in 2014 and 3.9 per cent next year. This is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of growth in trading partners. Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption over the period. Over the medium term, GDP growth  of about 3&frac12; per cent a year is anticipated.  To achieve this, we will need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including through upskilling our workforce.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the current improvement, risks to the outlook remain. These relate to the low inflation observed in many advanced economies, geopolitical tensions as well as the underperformance of the euro area economy.</p><p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in the deficit in recent years.  This decline has been in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of the interim deficit ceilings under the EDP have been met and Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent in 2015.  This has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility in the international markets, and bond yields have fallen substantially since the highs of mid-2011. The debt ratio has peaked and is now on a downward path.  After 2015, fiscal policy will be set in line with the requirement to move towards Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, which is for a balanced budget in structural terms.</p></reply>

These results will allow my officials to move to the next phase of crafting our plans to return some of the large investments made between 2009 and 2011 to the taxpayer. It is critical that we carefully examine all possibilities open to us to ensure that this investment is protected and enhanced with a view to ultimately generating an optimal return for the State.</p><p>  The return to profitability by AIB in the first half of 2014 is good news from the perspective of the Irish taxpayer, as it enhances the value of the bank for the taxpayer. The latest valuation of the AIB shares was carried out by the NPRFC at the end of 2013, and this valued the State's ordinary and preference shareholding at &euro;10 billion. Including the Contingent Capital (COCO), this brings the value of the State's shareholding to &euro;11.6 billion. Since the last valuation of the State's holding, bank stocks in many Eurozone countries have performed well, AIB has posted a profit in mid-2014 and I would therefore be confident that the current value of AIB is greater than the NPRF valuation at 31 December 2013.</p><p>  Officials from the Shareholding Management Unit in my Department engage regularly with AIB on a range of issues including the financial performance of the bank, strategic objectives and its capital structure. Following the successful completion of the Comprehensive Assessment my Officials will explore options around returning capital to the State.</p><p>  With respect to the State's holdings in the banks, Government policy remains unchanged and we do not wish to hold these investments in the banks over the long term.  Subject to market conditions therefore we are willing to exit in a manner that maximises value for the taxpayer.</p><p>  In the last 18 months the State has exited successfully from some debt investments with the sale of the Bank of Ireland Contingent Capital Notes and Preference Shares in addition to the sale of Irish Life. Holding our equity investments longer enables the State to benefit from the economic recovery and given the significant cash resources we hold, we are not under pressure to exit our remaining investments.</p></reply>

In formulating policies to meet these goals my Department has a number of procedures in place to assess the distributional impact of tax measures which help ensure their fairness.</p><p>  These procedures include a distributional analysis of direct taxation measures across a range of income levels, family types, and case studies. This analysis was published in the Budget book and show gains to all household types. For example the analysis shows that a single earner on an annual income of &euro;25,000 will gain &euro;174 per annum; a married one earner couple on &euro;35,000 will gain &euro;174; while a married one earner couple with two children on &euro;55,000 will gain &euro;626 per year. These gains reflect the Government's commitment to helping those on lower and middle incomes.</p><p>  Analysis of the taxation measures in the budget based on the ESRI SWITCH tax-benefit model indicates that all household deciles will gain from the income tax measures in Budget 2015. Some of these gains arise from the increase in the exemption threshold for the USC which had the effect of removing lower income people from the liability to pay USC (the second time the Government has done this). This means that all individuals with income below &euro;12,012 will be entirely exempt from the USC. The Government also reduced the lower USC rates and increased their thresholds delivering further benefits to those on lower incomes and ensuring fairness.</p><p>  At the same time, the benefits for any individual from the income tax package were capped by introducing a new higher rate of USC for high income individuals thus maintaining the progressivity of the system and ensuring that those on high incomes did not benefit over and above what is fair.</p><p>  These changes occur against the backdrop of Ireland having one of the most progressive income tax systems in the OECD.</p><p>  With regard to indirect policy changes my Department is cognisant of the effect of these types of taxes on those lower down the income distribution. However the number of indirect tax policy changes affecting households in this budget was limited. The increase in excise on cigarettes was motivated by the negative health outcomes of smoking, while the main increase in indirect tax revenue resulted from a technical change where VAT is charged for cross-border EU telecommunications, broadcasting and electronically supplied services.</p><p>   The tax measures outlined above are not only designed to extend the recovery across economy but also aim to strengthen the recovery for the future. These reductions in tax have the effect of increasing the reward from employment. They lower the cost of employing people which will help create jobs. Indications from the ESRI HERMES macroeconomic model shows there could be up to 15,000 jobs created from the reductions in labour taxation when the full effect of the tax reforms that will be introduced over the next three years take effect.</p><p>   Finally, I believe that creation of jobs for the unemployed remains a key element of promoting a fair and inclusive society. The measures I have implemented will go a long way towards achieving this.</p></reply>

Profits or gains from these activities that are not attributable to a relevant planning decision are taxed in the normal way. In Budget 2015, I announced the abolition of the windfall tax provisions from 1 January next and this is being provided for in the Finance Bill published last month.<br/><br/>The &quot;Construction 2020 - a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector&quot; Report published in May 2014 focuses on the steps that can be taken in the immediate future to ensure that necessary and sensible development can take place in the construction sector and that such development is not held back by unnecessary obstructions. One of the action points in the Report requires consideration of the tax code as it applies to the construction and property sector to establish if they are fit for purpose and otherwise to improve, abolish or replace them.<br/><br/>In that context, my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners undertook a review of the windfall tax provisions as part of this year's Budget and Finance Bill process. In the course of that examination, the views of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and of the National Asset Management Agency were sought on the provisions and the views on the windfall tax as expressed by bodies such as the Housing Finance and Sustainable Communities Agency were also considered. Arguments for the significant amendment or abolition of the windfall tax provisions were made in a number of pre-Budget submissions sent to me by various bodies, including the Construction Industry Federation, Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Property Industry Ireland and Chambers Ireland.<br/><br/>There are a number of reasons why, on foot of the review by my Department and the arguments made by others, I decided to abolish the windfall tax provisions. No gains or profits to which the current provisions apply have been returned since their introduction in 2009. While this is due largely to the lack of activity in the property market over much of this time, there is considerable doubt that the provisions would operate in an effective way on the ground or could be amended to operate effectively.<b></b>More significantly, however,<b></b>the views which I have seen expressed by various parties in both the private and public sector with an interest in the proper development of the housing market, and with which I agree, is that the windfall tax provisions are acting and will act as an impediment to land rezoning, land development and redevelopment and to land sales for development.<br/><br/>The abolition of the windfall tax provisions should be seen in the context of other decisions and proposals announced recently, including those by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, which are focussed on encouraging increased activity in the residential construction sector to meet increasing demand for housing. I indicated in my Budget speech, however, that while the Government is doing its part to remove impediments to a fully functioning property market, there will be no return to the past where tax incentives for developers drove supply. I also announced in the Budget that there will be a consultation in the coming months on taxation measures that might be introduced to address the issue of land owners who do not develop zoned and serviced land.</p></reply>

I have informed the House previously that the Government intends to bring forward legislation to ensure that, where a regulated financial entity sells its loan book to an unregulated entity, the protections afforded under the Central Bank codes will continue to apply. The Government has reiterated this commitment on several occasions.<br/><br/>In July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.  The Department of Finance received 19 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders. These have been published on the Department's website at .  Officials in my Department have carefully considered the submissions and are working with the Office of the Attorney General to progress this legislation. It is anticipated that it will be published by the end of this year.<br/><br/>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  The CCMA applies to the mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except credit unions, operating in the State, and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up repayments on a mortgage loan which is secured on a primary residence are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty.  The Deputy will be aware that the CCMA places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender to address a primary dwelling mortgage difficulty before any legal action is considered.  <br/><br/>The CCMA also provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a cooperating borrower.  Any bank proceeding to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers, in circumstances where an alternative sustainable arrangement is feasible and can be agreed, is not acting in a manner consistent with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) process, or with the CCMA.  Of course, the CCMA and MARP can only achieve positive results in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.  Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.  However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable conclusion for the respective parties. It should also be noted however, that even if the MARP process has concluded and where legal proceedings have commenced, the CCMA requires that a lender must continue to maintain contact with the borrower (and/or his nominated representative) periodically to see if an alternative repayment arrangement can be agreed even at that late stage.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that even if a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.  In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.  <br/><br/>The Central Bank has informed me that it has communicated to firms its preference that the outcome of any sale of mortgage books by regulated entities would ensure continuity of borrower protections under the relevant Codes and also that the purchaser would have relevant policies and procedures, systems and control checks to appropriately manage a mortgage loan book.  It is in the best interests of unregulated firms that acquire loans to have the residential mortgage books serviced in compliance with the CCMA, as following the CCMA is in the ultimate best interests of both their business and their customers.<br/><br/>The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the MARP, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort. Every effort should be made to agree an acceptable arrangement as an alternative to repossession. Regretfully, however, it must also be accepted that due to the individual circumstances, not all mortgages can be made sustainable and that in these limited circumstances, it will be in the best interests of both parties to resolve the situation in a fair manner.<br/><br/>Indeed I was pleased to note in the mortgage restructures publication for August published by my Department that there was a significant increase of almost 5% in the number of permanent mortgage restructures over the July data.  This is, in my view, a clear indication that cognisance is being taken by lenders of the need to ensure that the family home is protected in accordance with the terms of the CCMA.</p></reply>

The contribution formula for the EU Budget is comprised of Traditional Own Resources (customs duties), a VAT-based payment and a balancing component paid in accordance with each Member State's (MS) share of EU Gross National Income (GNI).</p><p>  Annually, a technical rebalancing exercise is carried out whereby updated Member State GNI and VAT data is used to retrospectively adjust preceding years' budget contributions. The updated data is agreed with the relevant national authorities, including the CSO and the Revenue Commissioners in Ireland. These balancing payments are called up for automatic payment, in accordance with the relevant legislation, on 1 December every year.</p><p>  In parallel with this, the Commission has proposed Draft Amending Budget 6 (DAB 6) which includes a technical redistribution of these balancing payments across MS. The net impact of these two exercises is an estimated additional contribution of &euro;6.5m for Ireland. It should be noted that, whereas the payment under the technical balancing exercise is automatic, DAB 6 must be agreed by both Council (QMV) and Parliament. Separately, DAB 6 also updates the forecast for MS customs duties in 2014 to reflect current revenue developments. For Ireland, this involves a separate increase of &euro;6m in our customs duties payment.</p><p>  In relation to the change in the treatment of research and development in the national accounts, this was introduced as part of the new ESA 2010 statistical standards. However, MS GNI based contributions will be calculated on the basis of the earlier ESA 1995 standards until the new Council own resource decision is adopted (likely to be in 2016).  As such, Ireland's additional contribution under the rebalancing exercise is unrelated to the change to ESA 2010.</p><p>  Inclusion of certain previously excluded illegal activities are part of the ESA 1995 framework. However, as illegal economic activity accounts for less than 1% of Irish GDP, the impact on our EU budget contribution is negligible.</p></reply>

These include but are not limited to the following:<br/><br/>- Term Extensions <br/><br/>- Split Mortgages <br/><br/>- Permanent Interest Rate Reductions <br/><br/>- Voluntary Surrender <br/><br/>The Central Bank's latest 'Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics' publication for the end of Quarter 2 2014 (), shows that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) in arrears, fell for the fourth consecutive quarter and at the end of June 2014, 90,343 (11.8 per cent) primary dwelling mortgage accounts were more than 90 days in arrears, representing a decline of almost 3% over the quarter.  The publication also shows that 101,973 PDH accounts were categorised as restructured at end June, an increase of 10.3 per cent from the stock of restructured accounts at the end of March 2014.  Some 81.2 per cent restructured accounts were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement, which is a good indicator of the sustainability of proposed solutions. In addition, almost 24,000 BTL accounts were categorised as restructured at the end of June, reflecting an increase of 3.3 per cent from the stock of restructured accounts reported at end-March 2014.<br/><br/>Separately from Central Bank quarterly reports, a monthly reporting regime on mortgage restructures and arrears for the six main banks covered by the Central Bank's MART process has been put in place by my Department.  The latest publication, with data to the end of August, shows an increase of almost 5% (3,800) permanent mortgage restructures since the end of July 2014. The data published by my Department, as well as the Central Bank data, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in mortgage arrears as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.  The framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  Both my Department and the Central Bank will continue to keep the position under review and make any further adaptions to the overall resolution framework as may be considered appropriate.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the majority of cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures can and are being put in place.</p></reply>

The application of the SME Code varies depending on whether the relevant purchasing entity of the commercial loans is a regulated entity or an unregulated entity. If the purchasing entity is a regulated entity, it is required to comply with the SME Code. The Government now proposes to protect all consumers and SMEs whose loans are sold to an unregulated entity by ensuring that owners of credit are regulated and therefore comply with the applicable Central Bank Codes.</p><p>  It is also important to note that the sale of these loans does not change the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in any way. Irrespective of who acquires the loan(s) they will be required to honour the legal terms and conditions of the existing loan agreement(s).</p><p>  Where the issue is refinancing loans by the SME from an exiting banks, the option of appeal to the CRO is available where the business is attempting to refinance with AIB or Bank of Ireland.  As the Deputy is aware, in Budget 2014, I announced an increase in the limit for loan applications that can be reviewed by the Credit Review Office (CRO) from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3m. This increase will facilitate requests from a broader range of SMEs, as well as assisting those borrowers currently banked with non-trading banks and banks which are strategically exiting the Irish SME lending market, whose refinancing requests are larger than &euro;500,000.  In Budget 2015, I announced that the CRO remit is being further extended with Permanent TSB agreeing to participate in the CRO process and Ulster Bank considering a similar commitment.</p><p>  The subject of refinancing is also being examined in context of the review of the Credit Guarantee Scheme by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation who has primary responsibility for the scheme.  The issue of utilising the Credit Guarantee Scheme to refinance SME loans from exiting banks is being considered.  I understand that this is currently at an advanced stage with deliberations between Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Office of the Attorney General and Directorate-General for Competition at EU regarding State Aid issues.</p></reply>

The Central Bank does not provide updates on bond sales outside of their annual report.</p><p>  Under the original Promissory Note arrangement, the Government was scheduled to make annual payments of &euro;3.1 billion thereby putting significant upward pressure on the amounts to be funded from the market. Following a long period of negotiation the notes were replaced in February 2013 with a portfolio of Irish Government bonds (as outlined above). The provision of these long-term non-amortising Government bonds to replace the amortising Promissory Notes has therefore had significant benefits from a market perspective as it ensures that there will be much less issuance of Irish Government bonds into the market over the next decade and beyond than would otherwise have been the case.</p><p>  The market continues to react positively to the restructuring and we have recently seen further reduction of the 10 year bond yields to c.1.8%, far lower than had been the case before the State entered the EU/IMF programme and thus enabling the State to substantially reduce its cost of borrowings.</p></reply>

This includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument. Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.<br/><br/>What is now required is a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty. The aim is to have this process completed as soon as possible, subject to completion of national approval procedures. For Ireland the European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Act 2014 (No. 32 of 2014), which was enacted last week following signature by the President, fulfils this purpose. The Single Supervisory Mechanism is, as of yesterday, 4<sup>th</sup>November, in place and operational. The latest available information is that the ESM Board of Governors will take a decision to implement the ESM DRI in early December.<br/><br/>In relation to retroactive recapitalisation, the draft guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement. As I have stated previously, it will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retroactive recapitalisation before the Instrument is in place.<br/><br/>However, I would remind the Deputy that unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.<br/><br/>The decision on any application once the instrument is in place is a matter of timing. I believe that in Europe a strategic approach tends to deliver the best results, which is why I intend to keep the option of a retroactive recapitalisation firmly on the table.</p></reply>

This was clearly demonstrated some months ago when the credit rating agencies stated that their upgraded ratings for Ireland reflected, in part, the positive impact they considered that NAMA's actual and planned accelerated disposal programme would have on Ireland's creditworthiness.</p></reply>

I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so. The measures announced in the Budget are the first stage of a reform plan, to be undertaken over a number of years, to address this issue, particularly for middle-income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn.</p><p>  In Budget 2015 I announced a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40%.  I also extended the standard rate band on which income tax is chargeable at the lower 20% rate by &euro;1,000. </p><p>  In addition I have reduced the two lower rates of USC from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Furthermore, I have also increased the threshold before which the 7% rate of USC becomes payable to &euro;17,576, so that those on the minimum wage will now only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC.</p><p>  The Budget also provides for the retention of the exemption from the top rates of USC for medical card holders with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000. These individuals will now only be liable to pay a USC rate of 3.5%, down from 4%. This reduced rate will also apply to the over 70s, with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000, again down from 4%.</p><p>  Ireland already has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world. To preserve that progressivity, the Budget also contains USC measures which have the effect of limiting the maximum benefit from this package of tax measures to approximately &euro;14 per week for any individual taxpayer, which means that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent, as those with more modest incomes.</p><p>  While the benefits from the changes introduced in Budget 2015 are broadly proportionate to the level of income earned for those on low and middle incomes, the reality is that because of the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system those on lower incomes pay very low levels of tax, particularly when compared to their counterparts in Europe. </p><p>  Currently, a single individual employed on the standard minimum wage of &euro;17,542 per annum pays income tax of &euro;4.01 and USC of &euro;10.51 per week. Furthermore, someone on the standard minimum wage is also exempt from paying PRSI. As a result of the changes introduced in Budget 2015 the weekly USC charge of &euro;10.51 per week will fall to &euro;7.19 per week. This means their tax bill will be reduced by just over 20%.</p><p>  In contrast a single individual earning &euro;70,000 per annum currently pays &euro;25,531 per annum or &euro;490.98 per week in income tax, USC and PRSI. After Budget 2015, this individual's tax bill will be reduced by about 3%. Contrasting these two examples, I cannot agree that the income tax budget measures disproportionately favour those on higher incomes. In fact, the highest proportionate benefit as a percentage of net income from the Budget tax changes occurs at an income level of just over &euro;12,000. This is a result of my decision to extend the USC exemption threshold from &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012, which also has the effect of removing 80,000 low earning individuals from the charge entirely.</p><p>  The changes announced in the Budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and/or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015. I propose to continue this reform in future Budgets, subject to the required economic growth and the consequent fiscal space available to the Government.</p></reply>

As I have advised on many occasions in the past, a liability to LPT should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the purpose of the Building Condition Assessment (BCA) required by the Pyrite Resolution Board's Pyrite Remediation Scheme is to demonstrate damage and to inform whether sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore of the residential property should be undertaken in order to confirm that such damage arises from pyrite.  The BCA does not involve any invasive internal or external inspections to a residential property and, on its own, cannot be used to state conclusively that reactive pyrite is present in the sub-floor hardcore of the property.</p><p>  The exemption from LPT based on &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; has been comprehensively dealt with in a number of Parliamentary Questions this year, including Questions no 217 on 18/2/14 (8212/14), no. 121 on 30/4/14 (19698/14) and no. 43 on 19/6/14 (26462/14). </p><p>  Unless and until the LPT legislation is changed, Revenue has an obligation to act in accordance with section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) which requires that an LPT exemption can  apply only where the residential property has been assessed and a certificate confirming &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; has been issued.  This is the only type of certificate that is relevant and a homeowner cannot claim the exemption until it has been issued.</p><p>  LPT operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  When making an assessment, issues such as the presence of pyrite would be one of the factors that a property owner could take into account in valuing their property.</p></reply>

However, information from company announcements in the public domain, would suggest that between 8,000 and 10,000 mortgages in total have been sold to unregulated entities in recent years. <br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the Government intends to bring forward legislation to ensure that, where a regulated financial entity sells its loan book to an unregulated entity, the protections afforded under the Central Bank codes will continue to apply.  The Government has reiterated this commitment on several occasions.<br/><br/>In July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.  The Department of Finance received 19 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders. These have been published on the Department's website at .  Officials in my Department have carefully considered the submissions and are working with the Office of the Attorney General to progress this legislation.  It is anticipated that it will be published by the end of this year<br/><br/>The Central Bank has informed me that it has communicated to firms its preference that the outcome of any sale of mortgage books by regulated entities would ensure continuity of borrower protections under the relevant Codes and also that the purchaser would have relevant policies and procedures, systems and control checks to appropriately manage a mortgage loan book.  The reality is that it is in the best interests of unregulated firms that acquire loans to have the residential mortgage books serviced in compliance with the CCMA, as following the CCMA is in the ultimate best interests of both their business and their customers.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  </p><p>  The Department is undertaking a review of the maximum rent limits, the details of which will be published when finalised. </p><p>  I am concerned that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients. Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review.</p></reply>

The Pensions Act was amended in 2009 to broaden the options available to the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Act to include the benefits of deferred scheme members and post retirement increases in pension benefits.  Prior to the 2009 Act, only the benefits of active scheme members could be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits.</p><p>  The provisions in section 50 of the Act treats both active and deferred scheme members the same.  Both of these categories of scheme members participate in a scheme in a period where pension benefits are being accumulated and it is considered that in the context of the provisions of section 50 of the Pensions Act it is appropriate that they are treated in a similar manner.  Pensioner benefits are treated differently than the benefits of active and deferred scheme members though these benefits can also be adjusted following the change included in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013.  The changes to this section of the Act in 2009 and again in 2013 were designed to spread the risk of underfunding across all scheme members.</p><p>  You will appreciate that the legislative provisions in respect of pension savings will vary across jurisdictions.  In an EU context, where a pension scheme operates across EU Member States, the employees who are employed in a different Member State (i.e., the host Member State) may be subject to certain provisions (i.e., the social and labour law relevant to the field of occupational pensions) in that Member State which may provide for a different level of protection of pension rights. </p><p>  The issue of the signing of the Ministerial Order is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>  I am aware of the challenge facing all stakeholders in finding a solution to the significant deficit in this scheme and on the desirability of securing sustainable pension provision for all scheme members.  It is not planned to bring forward further changes to the provisions of section 50 of the Pensions Act at this time.</p></reply>

A 10% rate is charged on self-assessed income above this level, which compares with a 7% rate which is charged on PAYE incomes above that level.</p><p>  When USC was first introduced in 2011 the PRSI ceiling on income over &euro;75,000 was also removed for all PAYE employees. This meant that those on PAYE incomes of over &euro;75,000 would now be liable to an additional 4% charge on that portion of their income.  At the same time PRSI for self-assessed income earners was increased by 1% from 3% to 4%.</p><p>  In order to maintain the differential it was decided to introduce an additional USC rate of 10% on self-assessed income over &euro;100,000.  The alternative would have seen self-assessed income earners on high incomes benefit hugely at a time when their PAYE counterparts were losing from the tax changes introduced in 2011.  On the basis of fairness, this could not have been countenanced at the time.</p><p>  Similarly, it was necessary to increase this 10% rate to 11% in Budget 2015 in order to ensure that the self-assessed on high incomes do not benefit disproportionately and that the maximum benefit from the income tax package is capped for all tax payers.  Thus from 2015, self-assessed income in excess of &euro;100,000 will be subject to an 11% rate of USC in comparison to an 8% rate that will apply to PAYE income in excess of that level.</p><p>  It is worth pointing out that the self-assessed benefit to the same extent from the Budget measures as their PAYE counterparts.  They benefit from the cut in the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40% and from the increase in the standard rate bands.  In addition, the changes to the USC will also be beneficial to them on incomes up to &euro;70,000.  This year, the self-assessed on incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 face a marginal rate of income tax of 55% including USC and PRSI.  That marginal rate will be unchanged for this cohort in 2015.  However, the marginal rate that applies on incomes below &euro;70,000 will be reduced by 1% for all taxpayers currently paying the higher rate of income tax, as a result of the Budget changes.</p><p>  There are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.</p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school.  Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. <br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.  This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.  The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b></b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<br/><br/>In relation to exempting childcare costs from tax when the service is provided by an employer, a relief did exist in the form of a benefit-in-kind exemption, where childcare facilities were provided by the employer.  However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011.  The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.<br/><br/>I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs.  To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children. <br/><br/>While wanting to encourage female participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home that they are making a less valuable contribution to society. <br/><br/>In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax.  It could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

Profits or gains from these activities that are not attributable to a relevant planning decision are taxed in the normal way.  In Budget 2015, I announced the abolition of the windfall tax provisions from 1 January next and this is being provided for in the Finance Bill published last month.<br/><br/>The &quot;Construction 2020 - a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector&quot; Report published in May 2014 focuses on the steps that can be taken in the immediate future to ensure that necessary and sensible development can take place in the construction sector and that such development is not held back by unnecessary obstructions. One of the action points in the Report requires consideration of the tax code as it applies to the construction and property sector to establish if they are fit for purpose and otherwise  to improve, abolish or replace them.<br/><br/>In that context, my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners undertook a review of the windfall tax provisions as part of this year's Budget and Finance Bill process. In the course of that examination, the views of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and of the National Asset Management Agency were sought on the provisions and the views on the windfall tax as expressed by bodies such as the Housing Finance and Sustainable Communities Agency were also considered. Arguments for the significant amendment or abolition of the windfall tax provisions were made in a number of pre-Budget submissions sent to me by various bodies, including the Construction Industry Federation, Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Property Industry Ireland and Chambers Ireland.<br/><br/>There are a number of reasons why, on foot of the review by my Department and the arguments made by others, that I decided to abolish the windfall tax provisions. No gains or profits to which the current provisions apply have been returned since their introduction in 2009.  While this is due largely to the lack of activity in the property market over much of this time, there is considerable doubt that the provisions would operate in an effective way on the ground or could be amended to operate effectively.<b></b>More significantly, however,<b></b>the views which I have seen expressed by various parties in both the private and public sector with an interest in the proper development of the housing market, and with which I agree, is that the windfall tax provisions are acting and will act as an impediment to land rezoning, land development and redevelopment and to land sales for development. <br/><br/>The abolition of the windfall tax provisions should be seen in the context of other decisions and proposals announced recently, including those by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, which are focussed on encouraging increased activity in the residential construction sector to meet increasing demand for housing.  I indicated in my Budget speech, however, that while the Government is doing its part to remove impediments to a fully functioning property market, there will be no return to the past where tax incentives for developers drove supply.  I also announced in the Budget that there will be a consultation in the coming months on taxation measures that might be introduced to address the issue of land owners who do not develop zoned and serviced land.</p></reply>

Taken in conjunction with first quarter data, GDP grew by 5.8 per cent in the first half of this year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.</p><p>  Exports rose by 13 per cent in the year to the second quarter of this year.  This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001 and there is growing evidence that the impact of the patent expiry issue in the pharmaceutical sector appears to have passed. </p><p>  On the domestic front, personal consumption was up by 1.8 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter and investment increased by 18.5 per cent.  Consumer spending has been strong in the first eight months of the year.  Retail sales in the period January to September were up 6 per cent when compared with the same period in 2013.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up 3 per cent over the same period.  Investment is also growing with both building and construction and machinery and equipment spending on a rising path. </p><p>  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with employment increasing in each of the last seven quarters representing an increase of over 70,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 11.1 per cent in September, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012.  </p><p>  In terms of outlook, my Department is forecasting GDP growth of 4.7 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent in 2015.  This is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of economic growth in Ireland's trading partners.  Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption.  Over the medium term, GDP growth of about 3&frac12; per cent a year is anticipated.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the current improvement, risks to the outlook remain for Ireland.  These relate to the low inflation observed in many advanced economics, geo-political tensions as well as the underperformance of the euro area economy.</p><p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in the deficit in recent years.  This decline has been in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of Ireland's interim deficit ceilings under the Excessive Deficit Procedure have been met and Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent in 2015.  This has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility in the international markets - bond yields have fallen substantially since the high rates of mid-2011.  The debt ratio has peaked and is now on a downward path.  After 2015, fiscal policy will be set in line with the requirement to move towards Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, which is for a balanced budget in structural terms.</p><p>  Ireland's competitiveness has significantly improved in recent years.  Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to the euro area.  The Government remains focused on the need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including through up skilling of the workforce.</p></reply>

The implementation of this strategy is overseen at Government level by the Construction 2020, Housing, Planning and Mortgage Arrears sub-committee, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, and at official level by a mortgage arrears steering group which is chaired by the Department of Finance.</p><p>  Taken together, the overall strategy and framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  The data published by my Department, as well as the Central Bank data, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in mortgage arrears, as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.  Nevertheless, relevant Departments and agencies will continue to keep the position under review and can make any further adaptions to the overall framework, as considered appropriate.  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders remains key to resolving most cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures can and are being put in place.  However, increased engagement by the financial institutions with borrowers in long-term arrears will be necessary to appropriately address unsustainable mortgage loans.</p></reply>

Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks achieved their targets.  Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.  In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector.  Although the targets were a useful policy intervention, the focus is now shifting towards the collation and examination, on a monthly basis, of more granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector. </p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and play a vital role in the continuing recovery of employment growth in our country. In this regard specific measures to promote access to finance for SMEs are a central feature of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2014.</p></reply>

Based on information in the public domain, however, a transaction worth approximately &euro;223 million took place between two regulated entities and this is estimated to cover between 1,000 and 2,000 mortgages.

The Government has reiterated this commitment on several occasions. In July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.<br/><br/>The Department of Finance has now received 19 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders. These have now been published on the Department's website at .<br/><br/>Officials in my Department have carefully considered the submissions and are working with the Office of the Attorney General to progress this legislation. It is anticipated that it will be published by the end of this year. <br/><br/>As stated in the public consultation document, the proposed legislation is not retrospective. However, it is intended to apply to all loans, regardless of when they were acquired, thus capturing entities which have already purchased loan books.</p></reply>

Loan agreements with the international funders, KfW and the European Investment Bank, to the value of &euro;550m have been signed to fund the SBCI during its initial period of operations. </p><p>  The SBCI is funded to the value of &euro;800m of which &euro;150m is from KfW, &euro;400m from the European Investment Bank and &euro;250 from the National Pension Reserve Fund.</p><p>  A key benefit of the SBCI will be its ability to facilitate loans with initial capital repayment breaks or the offering of loans with longer durations than are typically available currently.  In such cases, SMEs would have greater capacity to make investments on the basis of improved cash flow matching, which makes growth more likely.  Additionally, the expanded pool of lending products could serve the needs of a wider cohort of SME customers than is presently served by lenders in the market.  Improved credit products are expected to incentivise demand from SMEs for finance for the growth of their companies.</p><p>  The SBCI will fund and design product programmes to be distributed through a range of channels of finance companies including traditional banking institutions.  The SBCI will focus on facilitating the funding of new entrants to this market.  By reducing barriers to entry in the SME finance market for new entrants, the SBCI will relentlessly encourage competition thereby improving the quality and range of SME finance available.</p><p>  Credit is the lifeblood of all businesses and SMEs need to be able to access loans of greater duration, with enhanced terms and potentially at a lower cost facilitated by a state financial institution. KfW and the EIB have provided lower cost funding to the SBCI for up to a 10-year term.  Locking in funds at a lower cost for a 10-year period is both a major benefit and a risk mitigant for the SMEs.  Bank funding costs could increase for a whole host of reasons and to lock in lower cost funding would be a major benefit in protecting employment in the SME sector in such circumstances.  This should provide increased confidence to the SME sector as it increases the certainty around the availability of funding to that sector even in adverse financial market conditions.   This will protect existing employment in the SME sector as well as boosting employment as SMEs will be able to finance investments using new types of lending products that are not available at present.</p></reply>

In future, all appointments to State Boards must be advertised openly on the State Boards portal at , which is operated by the Public Appointments Service. These applicants will be advised of this new procedure.<br/><br/>The new model will mean that all appointments must meet the specific and detailed criteria determined by the relevant Minister as necessary for a member of the particular Board.<br/><br/>All appointments will be subject to the new arrangements, other than those where vacancies must be filled through a particular process or where a Minister is reappointing a Board member and where that member has already demonstrated their capacity to perform effectively.  A transparent assessment system will be designed and implemented on an independent basis by the Public Appointments Service to process the applications.<br/><br/>The new arrangements also provide that the stateboards.ie website, as well as being the sole portal for the receipt of applications for all State Boards, will also contain definitive and current information on all statutory boards. This information will be published on the stateboards.ie website in the near future.<br/><br/>Appointments will continue to be the exclusive responsibility of the relevant Minister in line with the statutory requirements relating to the appointment of specific persons to State Boards on an ex-officio basis, or on the basis of nominations received from other Ministers or particular stakeholders.<br/><br/>The revised approach strengthens requirements on Ministers to develop comprehensive criteria for the filling of vacancies on State Boards in consultation with key stakeholders as determined by the relevant Minister, such as the current Chair of the State Board concerned and the Public Appointments Service.<br/><br/>I will be expected to provide the Public Appointments Service with the key requirements that a candidate must meet, including:<br/><br/>- Specialist skills and technical knowledge;<br/><br/>- Relevant experience and sectoral expertise;<br/><br/>- Educational and other qualifications; and<br/><br/>- Particular personal attributes.<br/><br/>On foot on the Government Decision, my officials are currently preparing overarching guidelines on appointments for approval by Government, including issues related to gender and diversity. As part of this process all Departments have been contacted seeking comprehensive details on all State Boards under their aegis.<br/><br/>A review of these new arrangements will be carried out and completed within eighteen months.</p></reply>

These include the appointment by the Minister of the Panel of Adjudicators, who must be highly qualified and suitable in order to ensure quality outcomes in disputes referred under the Act, the appointment of a Chairperson for that panel, and  the drafting and publication of a code of practice for the conduct of adjudications, which will be binding on all adjudicators operating under the Act, not just those appointed to cases by the Chair of the Adjudication panel.  Work on these items, and the required consultation with industry, has been and is ongoing.<br/><br/>It is hoped that the Act will be implemented in full by Spring 2015.  A specific date of implementation will be announced in advance once it has been finalised, to provide sufficient notice to those affected by the Act's provisions.</p></reply>

Of the 108 appointments I have made since coming to Office in March 2011, only 41 were new appointments that could be considered as such.  24 appointments were reappointments and the remaining 43 were allocated under legislation to Department Representatives, social partners, nominees of other Ministers, nominees of prescribed bodies and appointments on an <i>ex officio</i>basis and were not appropriate, therefore, for public advertisement. <br/><br/>To assist me in making appointments, I asked the Public Appointments Service (PAS), in December 2013, to administer a single Expressions of Interest process in respect for vacancies arising in 2014 on the Boards of all Agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit.  The process generated a very strong response in terms of both the number and quality of the Expressions of Interest received.<br/><br/>This has produced a pool of over 200 candidates, collectively, comprising a wide variety of skills and attributes that have already informed a number of board appointments I have made this year.  In respect of appointments that are wholly within my discretion, my overriding priority is to appoint the best people available for particular board positions. <br/><br/>I am satisfied that the involvement of the PAS in this process has assisted me in appointing appropriately skilled and experienced people required for membership of State Boards and accords with the spirit of the Government Decision in this regard.</p></reply>

Currently there are 32 beef slaughtering plants approved to export from Ireland to local, EU and third country markets and over 195 local authority approved plants that may export locally or to the EU.  The details (names/addresses etc) of all of the approved plants are on the websites of my Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  Prices are a function of the market conditions that prevail at a given time.  I cannot set the price of beef and neither can any other Minister for agriculture in the EU.  There is no evidence whatsoever that department policy or practice contributes to price fixing or cartel practices.  Indeed my Department publishes prices for each factory on a weekly basis and last month launched a Beef Pricewatch app, available on phones and other smart devices to increase transparency in relation to beef prices.<br/><br/>With regard to any suspected manipulation of the market, I would again ask the Deputy to bring forward any information or evidence she has in this regard to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission which has been formed through the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  The Commission is an independent statutory body that <i>inter alia</i>enforces Irish and European competition law in Ireland.  It does this by taking action against anti-competitive practices (e.g. price-fixing) and by blocking anti-competitive business mergers.  The Commission also has a role in promoting competition in the economy by identifying legislative restrictions on competition, advising the Government on the implications for competition of proposed legislation, and by providing general information about competition issues.</p></reply>

This exclusion may be for a period, including the life of a person, as the Court deems appropriate.  </p><p>  In addition, Section 61 of the Act allows a wide range of public authorities to seek a Court order relating to the management of animals and limiting the number of animals that may be kept by persons who the Court considers incapable of taking care of animals be it for health or other reasons.  I am aware of a recent case where a person purporting to offer an animal rescue service was convicted of cruelty to animals.  While the offences in this instance predated the coming into operation of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which came into operation on 6 March 2014, the change in the law will in the future make it easier for the Courts to issue disqualification orders in appropriate circumstances.</p></reply>

In so far as asylum seekers accommodated in the State's Direct Provision system are concerned, the House Rules and Procedures of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department specifically provide that assault is a criminal offence and encourages any resident who has been subjected to such an offence to report the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.<br/><br/>A number of the recommendations made in the report are already in train including the development of the RIA Policy and Practice document for safeguarding residents against sexual and gender based violence and harassment. This is available on the RIA website  <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.  Procurement of training for staff on the implementation of this policy document is currently underway. Another recommendation that there should be women only centres is also in train. A State owned centre in RIA's portfolio will be reconfigured as such a centre when refurbishment works end in a few months time.<br/><br/>In relation to the wider recommendations in the Report, including the length of time spent in direct provision, the Deputy will be aware that an independent working group has recently been established to make recommendations in relation to improvements to the protection process, including direct provision, and supports for asylum seekers.

Details in respect of each category are outlined as follows. <br/><br/><b></b><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b><br/><br/>The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.<br/><br/>Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require. <br/><br/>Expenditure on criminal legal aid in 2013 was &euro;50.8 million.  It is not possible to provide a breakdown of expenditure on a county basis as the majority of barristers addresses are recorded as being at the Law Library, Dublin 7.  <br/><br/><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b><br/><br/>In respect of civil legal aid, this is provided by the Legal Aid Board, an independent State agency. Persons availing of civil legal aid pay a contribution towards the service, with some exceptions, so it is not a free service <i>per se</i>. Exchequer funding is provided by way of a grant-in-aid to the Board. In 2013, this grant amounted  to &euro;33.759 million in the year. The service is primarily provided through the Board's law centre network and by its own solicitors, although private practitioners on the Board's panels are engaged to provide a complementary service by the Board, mainly in District Court family law matters. In addition to this the Board may engage the services of Barristers in cases where it is considered necessary. Members of the panels for private practitioners and barristers may provide services in a number of counties. It is not possible to give a breakdown of costs by county. <br/><br/>Due to the large amount of data involved, the information sought by the Deputy regarding payments to solicitors and barristers does not lend itself to inclusion here. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy under separate cover.</p></reply>

Of the 16 people on the ICLVR's list of the disappeared, ten have been recovered to date, the most recent being Brendan Megraw whose remains were found by the ICLVR last month in Co. Meath.  Our thoughts are with the Megraw family whose decades-long wait is now over and who will, I hope, gain comfort from finally being able to afford their loved one a proper burial.</p><p>  There are six other disappeared persons whose remains have yet to be located and whose families are still suffering.  The ICLVR is continuing its work on all these outstanding cases.  I want to assure those families of my and the Government's support for this ongoing humanitarian work.  I call on anyone with any information on the disappeared to provide it in strict confidence to the ICLVR without any further delay.  Any information provided can only be used for the purpose of finding the victims' remains and, no matter how seemingly insignificant, could hold the key to ending another family's suffering.</p></reply>

The Scheme is set out in the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations S.I. 124 of 2014 and, generally, applies to all public servants, including staff of the Irish Prison Service. The new Sick Leave Scheme was introduced, following the enactment of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments)(Amendment) Act 2013 by the Oireachtas. <br/><br/>The new provisions allow staff access to the following paid sick leave:<br/><br/>-  a maximum of 92 days on full pay in a rolling one year period;<br/><br/>-  followed by a maximum of 91 days on half pay in a rolling one year period;<br/><br/>-  subject to a maximum of 183 days paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.<br/><br/>With regard to self-certified sick leave, the Scheme allows for:<br/><br/>-  no more than 7 days of self-certified sick leave in a rolling 2 year period, counting backwards from the day before the latest date of absence;<br/><br/>-  the duration of the absence on self-certified sick leave shall not be longer than 2 days in any instance.<br/><br/>There was a 38.3% decrease in the amount of self-certified sick leave taken by Irish Prison Service staff in 2013 compared to 2012.  There has been a further reduction of almost 2% in the amount of such sick leave taken between January and August of this year compared to the same period last year.  The figures requested by the Deputy in relation to self-certified sick leave are as follows:<table><tr><th><b>Period</b></th><th><b>Number of staff</b></th><th><b>Number of days</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2013</b></td><td>2685</td><td>5485</td></tr><tr><td><b>Jan to Aug 2014</b></td><td>2311</td><td>3722</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The figures requested by the Deputy in relation to overall sick leave in the Irish Prison Service are contained in the following table.  In conjunction with the implementation of the revised sick leave regulations for civil servants, the Irish Prison Service has introduced a number of measures to manage sick leave, including; twice yearly sick leave review meetings in all prisons, a new attendance management policy, a new accommodations policy which aims to facilitate a return to work at the earliest opportunity, a focus on sick leave at monthly HR Governor meetings and greater monitoring of the application of the sick leave regulations across the prison estate.<br/><br/>There has been a 13.7% decrease in the amount of sick leave taken by staff of the Irish Prison between January and August of this year compared to the same period last year. This has resulted in a saving of over &euro;700,000 and, through improved attendance, greater access to services for prisoners.<table><tr><th><b>Period</b></th><th><b>Number of staff</b></th><th><b>Number of days</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2013</b></td><td>3041</td><td>41,226</td></tr><tr><td><b>Jan to Aug 2014</b></td><td>2806</td><td>24,021</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that they are now at an advanced stage in planning the proposed refurbishment of Mullingar Courthouse which is part of the Government's infrastructure stimulus package.</p><p>  The proposed refurbishment of Mullingar Courthouse is one of seven projects included in a Courts Bundle which is to be delivered by way of Public Private Partnership (PPP). The Courts Bundle is currently in a procurement process which is being managed by the National Development Finance Agency. The funding of these projects will be by way of a unitary charge payment to the successful PPP company which is a monthly payment over the life of the project to cover the design, construction, financing and service provision and will commence on completion of the project, which is expected to be in 2017. These payments will be provided for in the Courts Service multi-annual capital provisions.</p><p>  It is expected that the contract for the Courts PPP Bundle will be signed in the final quarter of 2015 and that construction will commence soon afterwards with the work to be completed during 2017.</p><p>  The Courts Service is currently looking at possible alternative locations for court sittings in Mullingar once construction work commences on the courthouse. One possible location being considered is the use of accommodation within the Columb Barracks site in Mullingar and the Courts Service is in discussions with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence on this matter. The Courts Service has a limited budget for any works that might be necessary to make an alternative venue suitable for court use and is looking to achieve a solution which is effective and economic.</p></reply>

The Programme is aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It involves 124 locally managed school completion projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools. It provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. The programme's project model gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. </p><p>  The School Completion Programme budget allocation for 2014 is &euro;24.756 million. It is estimated by the Child and Family Agency that approximately 75% of this is expended on employment costs associated with projects. </p><p>  The School Completion Programme interventions are focussed on children and young people at risk of early school leaving rather than on their parents. In the case of each local projects the interventions provided form the basis of the annual School Retention Plan which is the basis for the funding provided to the projects. Projects are required to submit annual reports to the Agency, based on reviews of activity and interventions, including information on the participation levels of at risk pupils. </p><p>  Typically, projects offer homework clubs; breakfast clubs; mentoring programmes; learning support; social and personal development programmes. Support for out of school children in any project is an important objective of the programme.  I am advised by the Agency that approximately 2% of children who are targeted under the School Completion Programme are out of school. In the 2012/2013 school year, some such 595 children were supported under the Programme. </p><p>  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme is a school-based preventative scheme. It aims to promote and develop partnership between parents, teachers and community in order to enhance pupils&rsquo; learning opportunities and assist their retention and participation in the educational system.  Under the scheme, 402 local coordinators, who are serving teachers, serve 605 schools and organise locally based activities to encourage greater contact between parents and families and the school to tackle issues which impinge on participation in school and, ultimately, on the quality of learning. </p><p>  I have been advised by the Child and Family Agency that overall information relating to the numbers of parents of children that are out of school who participate in the diverse range of Home School Community Liaison Scheme activities and supports is not readily available. </p></reply>

To help address the issue, funding of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support the implementation of a number of targeted childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.  More than 100,000 children benefit from these programmes each year.</p><p>  The question of tax allowances for working parents who incur childcare costs was considered prior to the introduction of the targeted childcare supports which are now in place.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of tax relief for childcare.  This approach would not benefit parents working in the home and could, therefore, be seen by some as discriminatory.  Tax reliefs would favour the higher-paid, and those on the minimum wage or in part-time work would not be in a position to benefit to the same extent.  Many parents use childminders or relatives to meet their childcare requirements and may not be in a position to obtain receipts, making it impossible for them to establish their entitlement to tax relief.  There is also a view that the introduction of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents.</p><p>  I consider that the childcare programmes implemented by my Department, which include the universal free pre-school year, the Community Childcare Subvention programme and the Training and Employment Childcare programmes, are a fairer way of supporting parents who require childcare support.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency. Since 1st January 2012, the Board of Management for the Children Detention Schools at Oberstown, Co. Dublin, comes under the remit of my Department. I am responsible for appointments to these three Boards.</p><p>  Up to 31 December 2013 my Department also funded the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. With the establishment of the Child and Family Agency on 1 January 2014 the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board ceased to exist, and their roles were subsumed into the Child and Family Agency. Appointments to their boards ceased with effect from 31 December 2013. In making decisions on appointments to boards, subject to the governing legislation, the most suitable persons are considered for positions with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities. An appropriate mix of skills and experience is an important element of the selection process. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards.  Following this Government Decision, a notice was placed on my Department's website inviting expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under my Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>  In May 2013 the Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of my Department, sought expressions of interest from those interested in being appointed to the Board of the Family Support Agency having regard to both its existing statutory functions and its planned role in facilitating the establishment of the Child and Family Agency. The PAS provided my Department with the details of all suitable candidates who expressed an interest in being appointed to that Board.</p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <br/><br/>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <br/><br/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br/><br/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>As was outlined in the reply to your question of the 8th of July, it is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was subsequently received by the HSE on 25th July 2014 and is currently being considered in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.  No further comment is possible at this time as the HSE decision making process is ongoing.<br/><br/>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department, and the HSE, fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug.  While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

This agreement covers such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  </p><p>  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis.  The amount payable is the net difference between the estimated costs to the two countries for providing healthcare to entitled persons.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information for the particular year is complete.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  A total of &euro;172 million has been been paid by the United Kingdom in 2014. </p><p>  By far the largest part of the payments made on an annual basis under the agreement relates to the provision of healthcare to pensioners of one country residing in the other country.  The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable was based on a sample survey undertaken by both administrations every three years, the most recent of which was completed in 2008. </p><p>  Both administrations have since agreed, in principle, to work towards the introduction of a system of pensioner registration.  This will form the basis for calculating reimbursement costs in the future.  It was accepted that such a process would take some years to introduce. Consequently, both administrations agreed to interim arrangements for determining pensioner liability based on previous survey results trends.  Discussions between both administrations on introducing such a system of pensioner registration are ongoing.</p></reply>

As at the end of December 2013, the recruitment process was complete for 205 or 43% of these posts.  The continued implementation of the 2012 investment of &euro;35 million ensured that, at the end of 2013, the recruitment process was complete for 391.5 WTEs or 94% of the posts allocated in 2012.<br/><br/>The delay in the recruitment of 2013 posts was due to a number of factors.  There was no specific cost containment initiative but overall budgetary pressures within the HSE and the need to establish the type and number of posts required by each Community Mental Health Team both contributed to the delay in recruitment.  In addition, there were a number of posts for which there were difficulties in identifying suitable candidates due to factors including availability of qualified candidates and geographic location.  To help address these issues the HSE Service Plan 2014 committed to the streamlining of the recruitment process to allow for more local control and specialisation in respect of future appointments.  In addition, a comprehensive workforce analysis was carried out, together with priorities identified by Area Mental Health Management Teams, to inform decisions as to how best to target the 2014 investment in posts.<br/><br/>While no study or report was specifically commissioned into the impact of the delay of the full utilisation of the &euro;35 million in 2013, the HSE mental health management team continuously monitored and reported to me on the challenges around the recruitment process and actively managed this as part of the ongoing reconfiguration of mental health services, in line with the key multi-annual priorities in the 2014 National Service Plan.  Therefore, notwithstanding the delay in achieving recruitment, progress was made during 2013 in further developing our mental health services in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>, including the strengthening the Community Mental Health Teams, new clinical pathways for mental health in intellectual disability teams; delivery of 7,000 counselling sessions under the new Counselling in Primary Care initiative to 1,916 individuals, and a new e-learning suicide prevention programme for GPs.<br/><br/>In relation to 2014, while &euro;20 million was provided for mental health services, the HSE National Service Plan outlined that this expenditure would be phased-in, in order for the HSE to live within the overall available resource in 2014.  Accordingly, it was decided that the recruitment of 2014 posts would be commenced to provide for posts to come on stream during Q4.  To this end, and informed by the analysis carried out, some 200 posts have now been identified from the 2014 allocation and the recruitment process has now commenced.</p></reply>

This is of course a matter of concern for me but limitations on available resources present a real challenge.  My Department and the HSE are working to ensure that the resources that are available are deployed in the most effective way possible and deliver the best outcomes for older people.  This will require an integrated approach across community, residential and other service areas. </p><p>  The HSE controls the release of funding to manage the funds that are available across the course of the year.  Funding is released to approved applicants according to their place, in order of their approval date, on the National Placement List.  Over the course of the year to date, demand for funding has exceeded what could be released and the National Placement List has grown as a result. </p><p>  In July this year, the HSE allocated &euro;5m for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals who are on the NHSS National Placement List and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged. </p><p>  In Budget 2015 a further &euro;25 million has been allocated to alleviate the problem of delayed discharges.  This will be applied across community and residential services to improve Placement List waiting times and to relieve the pressure in acute hospitals resulting from beds being taken up by those who no longer require acute care.</p><p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which will be completed in the coming months, will include consideration of the future balance between community and residential services and the longer-term sustainability of the Scheme.</p></reply>

This advice is particularly important for bottle-fed infants, pregnant women and young children. </p><p>  Irish Water has indicated to the HSE that it does not have sufficient information to make a decision as to whether the water supply in the estate has lead levels that exceed the permitted limits. The HSE has informed me that Irish Water proposes to undertake further representative sampling to determine the extent of the lead levels across the estate. The HSE has advised Irish Water that these tests should be carried out as soon as possible.  </p><p>  I am informed that Irish Water has consulted the HSE in relation to the results from samples taken to date in this estate.  In accordance with the EPA/HSE Joint Position Paper on Lead, the HSE has advised Irish Water, as follows:-</p><p>  - As running the water from the cold tap in the kitchen sink (i.e. flushing) before using it for drinking or cooking may lower the level of lead, Irish Water should advise on appropriate flushing, testing and retesting to see if this works.</p><p>  - If after flushing and retesting the level of lead stays above 10 micrograms per litre, consumers should be advised to use safe drinking water from some other source. This is particularly important for bottle-fed infants, young children and pregnant women.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-05a.383.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110500089#WRX00700"><p>The Government is implementing a major reform programme in the health sector including significant structural reforms.  It has been delivering on the structural reform agenda for the health service in line with the course set out in &ldquo;<i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &ndash; 2014</i>&rdquo; as well as a number of other policy papers which focused on specific areas of the health service including acute hospitals and primary care.  In developing these plans, my Department and the HSE examined approaches that have been successful in other jurisdictions, such as Kaiser Permanente, in order to identify initiatives that could work in an Irish setting.  This research has helped to inform the changes that are now being implemented.  Our reform proposals place an emphasis on the need for integrated care, frequently cited as one of the key benefits of the Kaiser model.<br/><br/>I am happy to report that significant progress has been made in relation to this reform programme.  For instance, the HSE recently launched the <i>&quot;Community Healthcare Organisations Report</i>&quot;.  This Report sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system.  It will involve the present 17 Integrated Service Areas being replaced by nine Community Healthcare Organisations, which will be part of the HSE.  The primary focus is to provide the maximum proportion of care to people in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services.  The new structures will have a strong focus on building good linkages with the acute hospital system so that people&rsquo;s care pathways are appropriately planned and their needs met in the right setting.  <br/><br/>A new structure is also being implemented for acute hospitals through the establishment of seven Hospital Groups.  Under the new model, Hospital Groups will be given greater leadership roles and more operational freedom.  They in turn will be responsible for the delivery of hospital services within a performance and accountability framework relating to specific legal, corporate, clinical, financial governance and performance requirements.  This new model combines the advantages of devolved decision making, such as flexibility, innovation, and local responsiveness. These seven Hospital Groups will see the retention of a commitment to centrally prescribed national objectives and standards, offering enormous potential to enhance the quality and safety of the care provided in a more cost effective manner. <br/><br/>In addition to implementing the above, my Department is also currently developing a detailed policy in relation to the new health structures that will replace the HSE and meet our key objectives of greatly improving the delivery of services for patients and the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.  <br/><br/>Collectively, these new structures represent a comprehensive reorganisation of the health services, with a focus on providing high-quality, cost-effective and integrated care across the system as a whole.</p></reply>

Boards need a broad range of competencies in order to function effectively. My Department has developed a protocol for the filling of vacancies on boards, which involves the advertising of posts through the Public Appointments Service (PAS), taking account of the specific competencies and skills required in each case, and this has been circulated to Department officials who are responsible for the governance of boards. To date my Department has posted over 30 notices for expressions of interest to State Boards on its website or through PAS. </p><p>  My Department does not hold a list of applicants for positions on boards under its aegis.

Funding amounts to &euro;6.75 million annually. <br/><br/>  Prior to 2011 there was no detailed written agreement between my Department and the SEC, however the general understanding was that the Block Grant represented a student support to enable children of the Protestant community to attend faith based schools. <br/><br/>  In 2011 a formal agreement between the Department of Education and Skills and the SEC in relation to the Protestant Block Grant was put in place. <br/><br/>  Paragraph 2 of this agreement states that &quot;The purpose of the scheme will continue to be the provision of funding to assist necessitous children of the Protestant community in accessing second level education in a school that accords with their faith tradition.&quot;<br/><br/>  The agreement further states that &quot;In order to determine a pupil's eligibility for support under the Scheme, the Secondary Education Committee will confine support to pupils comprehended by the objective set in paragraph 2 and will operate a financial means test.&quot;</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS have ceased making payments to Institutes of Technology and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.

I will be focused on delivering in accordance with the recently published Implementation Plan to take forward the recommendations of the recent independent review of apprenticeship training in Ireland.

Bus &Eacute;ireann has also advised that many Operating Boards involve more than one school transport route. Frequently separate services to primary and post primary schools appear on a single Operating Board as each vehicle is utilised as fully as possible each day to maximise economy and efficiency, often operating multiple routes coordinated on one Operating Board. Therefore the number of operating boards is not directly comparable with the number of routes operated in any school year.<br/><br/>Under the procurement process, Bus &Eacute;ireann advertises the establishment of a qualification system each year in respect of a percentage of Contractors Operating Boards. In 2011, Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that the Company opened some 667 operating boards of existing contracted work to tender and awarded 636 contracts under this exercise.<br/><br/>The figure of 667 operating boards is 20% of the 3,335 Contractors' Operating Boards in the 2011/12 school year.

Section 13 of the Local Government Act 1998 repealed Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997. The Local Government Act 1998 provides for the means whereby financial resources are made available to local authorities and provided for the establishment of the Local Government Fund. The Fund has historically provided local authorities with finance for funding some of their day-to-day activities, including elements of water services costs, through General Purpose Grant allocations; for non-national roads; and funding for certain local government initiatives. As a result of the introduction of Local Property Tax in 2013 and the establishment of Irish Water, the local government funding model has changed considerably in 2014. The funding to be provided to local authorities for the provision of water services on behalf of Irish Water in 2014 is governed by Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and individual authorities.<br/><br/>Irish Water will receive a subvention of some &euro;440m from the Local Government Fund in 2014, which will fund water-related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and which would, historically, have been met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. In this regard, &euro;424.5m has been paid to IW to date in 2014.<br/><br/>Funding will also be provided in 2015 and 2016 from the LGF in the order of &euro;537m per annum.</p></reply>

From that date, the functions of these committees will become and be functions of and vest in each of the local authorities that form the committee in respect of that part of the drainage district that is within each of their administrative areas. Following the dissolution and transfer, the functions will be performed by the individual local authorities, subject to any alternative joint arrangements that may be made by the authorities concerned.  The joint drainage committees are funded from contributions from the local authorities represented on the committee apportioned on an agreed basis and future funding for works will fall to be agreed between the relevant authorities.</p><p>  Section 231(3) (a) of the 2001 Act obliges the chief executives of the local authorities to which the functions of the joint drainage committees are being transferred to take all steps that may be necessary to prepare for the dissolution and to make such alternative joint arrangements for the carrying out of the functions previously carried out by the drainage committees. In addition, section 231(3)(b) of the 2001 Act imposes a duty on the local authorities concerned to cooperate in relation to these arrangements.</p><p>  My Department wrote to chief executives on 23 October 2014 enclosing a copy of the dissolution order and reminding them of the requirements under section 231 of the 2001 Act, as outlined above.</p></reply>

The meter can, of course, be read manually by removing the boundary box lid and frost plug and reading the numeric flow register on the meter which records the cumulative usage. Water meter reading on behalf of Irish Water will be carried out using a receiver in the meter reader&rsquo;s van as it drives by. Only the serial number and the meter read are transmitted and collected and all signals are encrypted and can only be decrypted by Irish Water&rsquo;s software. Meter readings that are significantly higher than estimated household usage indicate that there is leakage on the customer-side of the meter. Irish Water&rsquo;s meters are fitted with leak alarms that will indicate if this is the case.</p><p>  The CER is currently finalising with Irish Water the details of a &ldquo;First Fix Free&rdquo; policy on which they will undertake a public consultation shortly. The intention is to have initial works commence in January 2015. If a customer disputes the metered usage, Irish Water will facilitate testing of water meters upon request from the customer as provided for in the Customer Handbook and Water Charges Plan approved by CER.  The CER and Irish Water have also agreed to enter into a voluntary &lsquo;Dispute Resolution Agreement&rsquo; which will set out agreed working arrangements and processes to deal with customer disputes. If the meter is found to be faulty (excluding damage caused by the customer) then Irish Water will not charge the cost of the meter inspection and testing to the customer and will repair or replace the faulty meter at no cost to the customer.</p></reply>

The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the economic regulation of Irish water and the charges to be levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER. Following a public consultation process, the CER announced its decision on water charges on 30 September. Water charges commenced on 1 October 2014 and the first bills will be issued by Irish Water to households from January 2015.<br/><br/>Group Water Schemes that are supplied by way of a connection to the public water supply network will have previously been non-domestic customers of the relevant local authority and will therefore now become customers of Irish Water. Under the arrangements determined by the CER, the existing charges for non-domestic customers will remain in place pending a further consultation. My Department understands that there may be some Group Schemes where local arrangements may have applied; the future arrangements in relation to these schemes will be resolved as soon as possible.<br/><br/>There are other Group Water Schemes that have their own water sources - these will not be customers of Irish Water and will continue to operate as before.<br/><br/>My Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding, where appropriate, of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector. Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards. This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<i>This co-operative approach will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.</i></p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance. The system of making retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax estimated to have cost the taxpayer some &euro;5 0 m annually.  The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months. Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use. The declaration can be made on-line at or through the local motor tax office. The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month to remind motorists that a vehicle must be either taxed or declared off the road for a further period.<br/><br/>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation, which is three months in the case a car and twelve months in the case of a motorcycle. A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.<br/><br/>Exemptions are not provided for in individual cases. This is to protect the new arrangements; allowing an owner to declare a vehicle off the road after the expiry of a current declaration of non-use could potentially be a move back to the system of retrospective declarations, thereby undermining the overall objective of the legislative change.</p></reply>

Positions have, where appropriate, been listed on the Department&rsquo;s website and, more recently, on stateboards.ie on a case by case basis as vacancies arise.  It should be noted that in the case of certain appointments, statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate. In addition, in the case of a number of Boards, not all of the appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, and in some situations appointments are made with the consent of another Minister.</p><p>  In line with a recent Government Decision, a Revised Model for Ministerial Appointments to State Boards, brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is being put in place, operating through the Public Appointments Service, and will govern relevant future appointments.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;Eircode&rsquo; brand was launched for the National Postcode System on 28 April. The project is currently in the implementation phase and is scheduled to be rolled out nationwide by the middle of 2015. Every Irish address will be receiving a unique Eircode by post.<br/><br/>The public awareness campaign began last April with the launch of the website . This website has information on Eircodes for both residents and businesses. The Postcode Management Licence Holder has briefed businesses in the interim through a series of seminars and plans further business events before the end of the year.<br/><br/>A comprehensive public information campaign will commence before the planned postcode launch in mid 2015. A key part of the campaign will involve outreach activities to ensure that all members of the general public receive information on Eircodes in an effective way.<br/><br/>The cost to the Exchequer of the National Postcode System over the 10 year cycle of the contract is expected to be &euro;26m (ex VAT) with costs covering design, database upgrades, media and postcode distribution. The cost of the contract will be &euro;16m over the first two years and this funding has been ring fenced in my Department&rsquo;s 2015 budget.<br/><br/>One of the main benefits of the design chosen which allocates a unique identifier to each address is that it helps resolve the issue of non-unique addresses which represent 35% of addresses in Ireland. <br/><br/>The Freight Transport Association of Ireland and other bodies have expressed concerns over the non-sequenced nature of the Eircode. The postcode design chosen will work to meet the needs of a wide range of public and private users, including logistics and delivery providers and the emergency services. A sequential design has a number of drawbacks, including the potential to lead to inability to assign a sequential Eircode to new build and to cope with the expansion in the number of addresses in the future. <br/><br/>The Eircode postcode will provide a geo location, sourced from Ordnance Survey Ireland, for postal address points that will assist with navigation and will link with online maps. When an Eircode for an address is entered into such systems, it will be possible to find relevant location and routing information. The introduction of Eircodes will be an important and effective strategic addition to our national infrastructure.<br/><br/>Privacy and data protection issues have been part of the debate on postcodes since the establishment of a National Postcodes Board in 2005 to examine the introduction of postcodes in Ireland. There has been engagement with the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the issue of postcodes generally at various points since then. <br/><br/>The necessary protections will operate around the use of Eircodes to ensure that data protection legislation is complied with. Holders of personal data are bound by Data Protection legislation on how they store and use this data, and the introduction of Eircodes will not alter this obligation.</p></reply>

The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband services, and are facilitating the rollout of 3G and 4G mobile services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of mobile voice and data services throughout the country.<br/><br/>While investment in communications infrastructure and services is primarily a matter for the private sector, Government recognises that it has a role in ensuring that barriers to investment are removed where possible.  The National Broadband Plan commits to a range of actions that will facilitate the more efficient<font color="#1F497D"> </font>investment in the rollout of communications infrastru<font color="#1F497D">c</font>ture. These include addressing planning and road opening challenges, assisting in getting citizens and businesses online, measures relating to spectrum policy and maximising the use of State assets where possible.<br/><br/>Since publication of the Plan in 2012, a working group has been established to address infrastructure issues which were identified by industry as creating barriers to deployment of services. The group is chaired by the Department of Transport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Local Authorities.  The Group is currently reviewing issues relating to the location of telecommunications infrastructure on public roads, particularly motorways, with a view to reducing blackspots and enhancing services.  Consultation between the NRA and industry is ongoing on a range of issues relating to the citing of telecommunications infrastructure.  Local Authorities also have an important role in assisting the rollout of supporting infrastructure.  My Department has worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to raise awareness of the role of the planning process in facilitating the delivery of telecommunications infrastructure and services. <br/><br/>My Department is also in the process of reviewing national spectrum policy and is currently considering the outcome of a recent public consultation on spectrum policy.  Current spectrum policy needs to be revisited as a matter of course and in light of the rapid technological changes and the increased demands on this limited and valuable resource.  An important element of this review is to ensure that our legal and regulatory environment supports continued investment in mobile telecommunication infrastructure, which is dependent on access to radio spectrum. It is expected that this review will be completed in the first quarter of next year. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, my predecessor commenced a process of seeking, on the Department&rsquo;s website, expressions of interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of this Department.  To date, 191 applications have been received under this process, all are retained in my Department, and this information has been used to inform decisions for board appointments.  I would stress, however, that such applications have been sought in order to extend the range of suitable persons from which a Minister might make appointments, not to constrain it.  While appointments are made by the relevant Minister, I would add that appointments to Boards also include nominations, provided for by statute, by Committees of the Oireachtas, worker directors and ex-officio positions.  While the precise structure varies from body to body, in total this can amount to a significant proportion of the Board in certain instances. </p><p>  On 30 September, the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform announced further steps to strengthen the process of Board appointments and my Department will be liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that procedures are in line with the new measures proposed.   </p></reply>
