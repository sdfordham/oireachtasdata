Following a meeting with a delegation of Russian officials in October 2013 my Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points.  This was forwarded to the Russian Authorities in February 2014.  In transmitting these revisions it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.  </p><p>  In April the Ministry of Education and Science advised the Irish Embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements were on hold while the Russian Government considered proposals in relation to how they deal with adoption agreements in general. </p><p>  The Embassy has recently advised that a reply from the Russian authorities to my Department's revised wording is expected shortly.  Once received it will be reviewed so that next steps can be taken.</p><p>  I have recently met with Maria Hunt of the Russian Irish Adoption Group to update them on the current situation with regard to discussions on a possible bilateral adoption agreement with Russia.</p></reply>

Depending on the nature of the individual circumstances, a child may be received into the care of the State.  At the end of July 2014, there were 6,466 children in care.<br/><br/>The majority  - 93% - of children in care are placed in foster care with a family.  Where a foster care placement is unsuitable, children may be placed in a children's residential centre.  There were 339 children placed in children's residential centres at the end of July 2014.  Children's residential centres can be operated directly by the Agency or by a private or voluntary provider on behalf of the Agency.  A child is placed in a private residential centre when no suitable Child and Family Agency placement is available and the placement has been assessed as meeting the needs of the child.  Children with more complex and challenging needs are generally placed in private residential centres.<br/><br/>Nationally, at the end of July 2014, 163 children in residential care were placed in  private residential centres, 38 of whom were in private residential centres in Dublin North East.  I am advised by the Agency that in February 2014, there were 63 Private Residential Child Care Centres in operation throughout the country.  21 of these were based in the Dublin North East Region.  I have asked the Agency for up to date information in relation to this Region and I will arrange for this to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.<br/><br/>The Agency undertook a tendering process in 2013 for the provision of private residential placements.  All Private Children's Residential Providers are now subject to contract.  The Agency advised that approximately 91 places in 23 centres operated by 9 providers will be subject to a block-book contract at &euro; 4,500 per week per place.  This is a reduction from the previous average cost of &euro;5,000 per week prior to tendering process.  The value of the tender is &euro;23.6 million. <br/><br/>The Agency advised that the number of placements procured is less than what is used from the private sector at any one time so the Agency does not pay for beds that are not used.  This means the Agency &quot;spot purchase&quot; a number of beds over and above what is procured on a block basis.<br/><br/>All private children's residential centres who were not awarded or did not enter the block-book element of the tender will also be considered as approved providers for &quot;spot purchased &quot; placements.  These &quot;spot purchased&quot; placements are now governed for the first time ever by an approved provider system.  136 places are available in 40 centres operated by 17 approved providers who were not part of the above tender process, should these placements be required by the Agency.  These providers are contracted to provide placements in this manner and costs only arise when a child is placed in one of these placements.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The cost of each child's placement will vary according to the identified needs of the individual child and  cannot be qualified,  though the base cost is generally &euro;5,000 per week.  </p></reply>

The decision to establish a Commission of Investigation into these matters received the unanimous endorsement of this House on the 11th June.  Since this date, considerable progress has been achieved in advancing the necessary legislative and operational arrangements required to establish a statutory investigation.  It is my intention to come back to both Houses during this D&aacute;il term with a draft resolution to establish the Commission.  </p><p>  The specific matters to be investigated and the appropriate range of methodologies to be utilised are being considered as part of Government&rsquo;s deliberations on the Commission.  The broad range of issues and concerns raised with my Department with regard to the proposed Commission's terms of reference are being given consideration in arriving at an overall scope for the Commission which is workable and effective. </p><p>  One of the key conclusions of the Inter- Departmental report published on the 16th July was that an opportunity for those who were mothers or children in Mother and Baby Homes to input their experiences should be developed.  This is recognised as requiring considerable and careful planning taking account of previous learning from similar processes in earlier investigations.  It is important that any such process should be as sensitive and non-adversarial as possible, consistent with the requirements of natural justice and the provisions of the Commission of Investigation Act 2004.  As the Commission will be addressing matters which touch on areas of great personal sensitivity it will be necessary that appropriate protocols be adopted which protect the confidentiality of sensitive personal information. </p><p>  More generally, our approach should have regard to the facts established through recent inquiries into related institutions, and the general experience gained in conducting similar investigations into matters of public importance.  Establishing an investigation which is capable of delivering on public expectations and effectively addressing these important matters in a sensitive and timely manner must be our primary concern. </p></reply>

Funding is provided by my Department to support a number of key childcare programmes which support the provision of early childhood care and education for more than 100,000 children each year and to assist their parents to avail of job opportunities.<br/><br/>Improving quality is critical to improving of educational outcomes for children.  The two Departments continue to collaborate on the quality agenda for Early Years Services.  Indeed the fact that the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills is co-located with my Department in Mespil Road is testament to the close working relationship.<br/><br/>My Department supports quality in pre-school education in a number of ways.  These include funding voluntary organisations to carry out the field testing of the Siolta Quality Assurance Programme and the roll out of the Aistear in Action projects, incentivising higher qualifications through the criteria for funding attaching to the free pre-school year, and, most recently, the introduction of new qualification requirements for staff in child care settings and financial support for staff to achieve those qualifications.  <br/><br/>In respect of primary and secondary level pupils, the Child and Family Agency assists the Department of Education and Skills in a number of ways.<br/><br/>The functions and operational responsibilities of the former National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) are now part of the new Child and Family Agency.  Since 1<sup>st</sup>January 2014 the staff of the former NEWB, including its Education Welfare Officers, have transferred to the new Agency. <br/><br/>The three service strands formerly under the remit of NEWB collectively form the Educational Welfare Services of the new Agency.  These are:<br/><br/>- The Education Welfare Service, which has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education,<br/><br/>- The Home School Community Liaison Programme, which has 402 school-based co-ordinators; and<br/><br/>- The School Completion Programme which has a &euro;24 m budget and provides to support 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools and providing targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.<br/><br/>I am confident that this Government's decision to amalgamate the educational welfare functions formerly assigned to the National Educational Welfare Board, into the Child and Family Agency will provide opportunities for more effective working amongst the range of professionals involved in directly supporting children and their families.  <br/><br/>The Children Detention Schools in Oberstown, provide education facilities to children detained there by the courts.  Educational Services are delivered to the children by the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board based on an education strategy agreed with the Irish Youth justice Service operating in my Department.  The Inspectorate within the Department of Education and Skills carries out inspections of these services.</p></reply>

In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78 m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p><p>  From within this budget, my Department provides funding to projects under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.  Some 230 projects are supported under the Fund. They are located in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The objective is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people into facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  In 2014, the allocation for the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund is &euro;18.4 m.</p><p>  The projects funded report on an on-going basis to my Department and they are linked with the Education and Training Boards in their respective areas in the context of overall youth funding at local level.  The projects provide annual progress reports on their activities and audited accounts to my Department.  The youth projects and services also provide a progress report on their engagement with the National Quality Standards Framework for youth work on an annual basis to my Department.  </p><p>  The Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund is one of three schemes administered by my Department that target young people who are &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; because they live in disadvantaged communities and they are vulnerable to drugs, alcohol misuse, or they are out of school, or at risk of homelessness.  Together the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, the Special Projects for Youth and Local Drug Task Force schemes account for 70% of the funding available to my Department for the provision of youth services.  In 2014, almost &euro;34 m was allocated to the schemes.</p><p>  My Department has recently completed a Value for Money and Policy Review of the schemes.  The review makes recommendations for the future operation of the schemes that will shape their development in the years ahead to ensure quality effective, value for money services that are evidence based and designed to secure the best outcomes for young people.  The review includes recommendations about governance processes that will improve oversight of how well the schemes are meeting their objectives for vulnerable young people.    </p><p>  I am currently considering the review's findings and recommendations and my Department is making arrangements for its publication at an early date.  I intend that the recommendations of the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy that is being developed by my Department.  The National Youth Strategy will be a strategy for all young people aged 10-24 years and it will have particular regard to young people experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and in most need of support.  The strategy will be informed by the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review as to how best the youth services may be developed for the future to meet the needs of this cohort of young people and improve the prospects of securing improved developmental outcomes for them.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be completed by the end of this year. </p></reply>

The majority of these services relate to Early Years programmes and services, some of which are:<br/><br/>- Conducting contractual compliance visits to participating childcare services under the large-scale Early Years funding programmes: Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) and CCS and payment administration, accounting and reporting for CCS and CETS;<br/><br/>- Managing a range of capital funding programmes and commitments (including the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme; the National Childcare Investment Programme; and early years capital schemes in 2012, 2013 and 2014).  The role includes application, appraisal and contract management as well as verification of the capital expenditure which involves on-site visits to a sample of projects;<br/><br/>- The management of the Early Years Practitioners Learner Fund 2014-2015 including the procurement of training providers and the administration, accounting and reporting of the funding.<br/><br/>- The development, delivery and management of business processes, systems and infrastructure to improve the supports provided to beneficiaries and the management of the state&rsquo;s investment in the early years sector, including on-line funding application and appraisal processes for capital and for the Learner Fund; Pobal maps, hosting of Tusla inspection report<br/><br/>Pobal also provides a number of other services to other aspects of the Departments&rsquo; remit, including for example grant management and support in relation the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme, and support for the National Early Years Access Initiative, the youth capital, youth services and youth cafe programmes, the School Completion Programme and the Family Contact Centre Pilot Initiative as well as for Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.<br/><br/>In 2013 my Department paid a total of &euro;5.7 million to Pobal for these services. The figure for 2014 is likely be similar; some services have been added in, e.g. the Learner Fund for the Early Years sector and some have been reduced or were more resource intensive in 2013, e.g publication of inspection reports.<b></b>The total budget for the services that Pobal deals with is of the order of &euro;300 million annually so the cost of the work Pobal does on the Department's behalf is approximately 2% of the total cost of the programmes.<br/><br/>There is ongoing review of programmes to ensure effectiveness and  that there is no duplication.  The very strong data management role that Pobal plays is a key factor in the Departments ability to review and assess programmes effectiveness, efficiency and value for money.</p></reply>

In 2014 &euro;49.78m has been allocated to my Department for these schemes.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people, and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 470 projects and 40,000 volunteers in local communities around the country.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, my aim is to highlight the potential youth work can play, as part of the response to the youth employment challenge, through collaboration with other interests.  Youth work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills - the 21st century skills - that are so important to training and career readiness.</p><p>  The work of the voluntary youth work sector, in the provision of youth services, has a significant contribution to make to the Government&rsquo;s jobs agenda for young people including the Action Plan for Jobs, led by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Pathways to Work and the implementation of the Youth Guarantee for unemployed young people, which is led by the Department of Social Protection. Many youth organisations are working closely with the relevant Government departments and delivering youth employment and youth employability measures to address the challenges of youth unemployment.</p><p>  The youth work sector has a significant contribution to make to a number of actions for progression by my Department in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  These include promoting youth entrepreneurship activity at local level, increasing participation in volunteering opportunities in youth services and promoting mobility and learning opportunities for young people under the European Commission&rsquo;s Erasmus+ programme.  In this context my Department, in consultation with the youth sector, has developed a &lsquo;Youth Employability Initiative&rsquo; which builds on existing youth work initiatives that increase the employability of marginalised young people in the 15 to 24 age group. The initiatives will target the hardest to reach young people who are at risk of becoming NEET (i.e. not in employment, education or training) for intensive support to prevent unemployment. My Department is liaising with the relevant Government departments in the development of the initiative for 2015.</p><p>  The National Youth Strategy 2014 - 2020 which being developed by my Department in collaboration with other Government departments and youth interests will have a particular focus on ensuring greater coordination in policy and provision across government for young people aged 10 &ndash; 24 years. The strategy will aim to be responsive to current and emerging issues which impact on young people&rsquo;s lives, such as the unemployment challenge at this time.</p><p>  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be completed by the end of 2014.</p></reply>

In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve, approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning.  My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in various fora in developing  key initiatives. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of the national youth organisations, Government departments and the Education and Training Boards, that support youth services at local level, has an important advisory role to me in matters to do with provision for young people. My Department has worked with the youth sector on the development of youth work responses to the challenges of youth unemployment, including the contribution that the youth services can make to the Government's employment agenda and the Action Plan For Jobs, 2014.</p><p>  The youth sector is engaged in the development, by my Department,  of the new National Youth Strategy 2014- 2020.  The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people, aged 10 to 24 years, while having particular regard to those young people who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and, therefore, in most need of support.  In consultation with the National Youth York Advisory Committee, my Department has set up a National Youth Strategy Task Group to oversee the development of the new strategy.  The Task Group, which meets regularly, is chaired by the Director of the National Youth Council of Ireland and comprises representatives from the youth sector, Government departments, Education and Training Boards, the Centre for Effective Services and the business community.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be completed by my Department for the end of 2014.</p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups. Earlier this month, over 2 days, I met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations.

Dublin, currently provide a total of 46 detention places for young people ordered to be remanded or committed by the courts.  These comprise 6 places for girls up to the age of 18 on admission and 40 places for boys up to the age of 17 on admission.  Boys aged 17 on being ordered to be detained are currently accommodated by the Irish Prison Service.  This practice will cease, meeting the commitment in the Programme for Government to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, when new children detention facilities currently being constructed on the Oberstown campus become available before the end of this year.  Construction commenced on site on the Oberstown campus in September 2013 and the new facilities will increase the capacity on the campus to provide sufficient accommodation for all children under 18 years of age ordered to be detained by the courts.  In the interim, pending introduction of the expanded facilities, the existing facilities at Oberstown are being used to meet demand from the Courts.

Each young person is assessed on admission to determine his/her need for specialist therapeutic interventions and to develop an individualised management plan which might include addressing offending behaviour, family therapy and other relevant programmes.  The Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board provide delivery of age and ability appropriate education services to the young people in detention including up to State examination level.</p></reply>

Regulations giving effect to the legislative changes are expected to be published shortly.  The new Regulations will impose qualification requirements of a minimum Level 5 award in early childhood care and education for all staff working in early years services (no requirement currently exists).  This requirement applies from September 2014 in the case of new services, and from September 2015 in the case of existing services.  In addition, the minimum qualification requirement for pre-school leaders delivering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased from a Level 5 award to a Level 6, from the same dates.</p><p>  In light of the proposed timeframes for the introduction of new qualification requirements, the Department has sought to work with the childcare sector to accelerate the process for training and up-skilling staff and improving the quality of care delivered to children.  &euro;0.9 million was provided to support a training programme in 2013 to provide support to staff who are seeking to meet the qualification requirements.  </p><p>  In March of this year, the Learner Fund was launched.  This Fund, which has an allocation of &euro;3m over the two years 2014 and 2015 and is sufficient to support all eligible applicants, is designed to support existing childcare staff to up-skill to meet new qualification requirements.  The Learner Fund is being administered by Pobal, with the assistance of local City and County Childcare Committees.

The programme is a free and universal provision to which all children have access.  </p><p>  To ensure that the ECCE programme is more accessible to children with special needs a number of additional provisions have been added.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.</p><p>  I am aware that the Health Service Executive does, where possible, provide additional supports to children with special needs to enable them to avail of pre-school services in mainstream pre-school settings.  My Department has been working with the Department of Health in the context of building better supports to facilitate children with special needs.  The aim is to develop an agreed framework for the provision of resources to support special needs children in mainstream childcare settings.  However the issue of supports for children with special needs availing of services in mainstream childcare settings remains a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></reply>

There has been no change in these responsibilities, nor is any change planned. Recent announcements by Minister O'Sullivan have related to her areas of responsibility and are very welcome as they will support the Early Years Quality Agenda which is the focus of the work of the Departments.   The first major review of education and training programmes that lead to qualifications in the early years care and education sector is a very timely development and will support the ongoing work to improve quality in early years through increasing the qualifications of staff.   Courses in this area have developed in an ad hoc way as the sector has grown and are delivered in a range of institutions, and there is a need to review the programme quality, the curriculum content and issues such as practice requirements.  It is important to ensure that we can be sure that individuals who take on a qualification are getting the most appropriate training in their own interests and in the interests of the children they will work with.  </p><p>  Reference has also been made to proposals to carry out education focussed inspections. The background to this is that during 2012 and 2013 inspectors from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and inspectors from the Department of Education and Skills carried out a pilot joint inspection.  This was a very useful exercise.  An issue identified was that there were weaknesses in relation to education and learning in a number of services that both Departments felt needed to be followed up.  For that reason, the Department of Education and Skills has been looking at how best they might carry out such education-focused inspections in a way that would complement to the work of the Early Years Inspectorate of Tusla.  There is as I understand it still some work to be done,  but progress is being made, in consultation with my Department.  </p><p>  The two Departments will continue to work closely together to press forward with the Quality Agenda and improve services for the benefit of children.</p></reply>

These reports are published on the Agency's website.  The report for July 2014 shows that 6,062 of the 6,466 children in care had an allocated social worker and 5,854 had an up to date written care plan.    6,000 children were in foster care,  5,609 of whom had an allocated social worker and 5,434 had a written care plan.</p><p>  The Agency has stated that it is their policy to ensure that all children in care have a Care Plan and that the Care Plan is reviewed as required by the Child Care Regulations. The Agency has advised me that day to day exigencies of service provision, such as staff absence due to annual, maternity and sick leave, can impact on services. The Agency further advised that there may be circumstances in which local decisions are made in regard to work planning within the context of service priorities, such as child protection workloads within an area or staff availability. In these circumstances, it may be determined that a &lsquo;child in care review&rsquo; can be deferred for a short period. Such a decision will be made on the basis of risk assessment and would apply to particularly stable care placements. Special Care, High Support, Residential care and short term foster care are all prioritised for an allocated social worker. Ongoing provision of social work to children and foster families is ensured in these circumstances.</p><p>  The Agency is in receipt of funding of &euro;6.7m this year to alleviate identified service pressures and to support the continuing implementation of the reform programme across children and family services.  </p><p>  This funding is being targeted at a number of areas, including the replacement of staff on maternity leave by way of  a 12 month temporary contract. Latest figures indicate that at the end of August, 164 staff were on maternity leave, 82 of whom were social workers. The Agency is also finalising proposals for the introduction of a guaranteed and protected one year induction programme for newly qualified social workers. </p><p>  The Agency recruited 106 social workers up to the end of August this year and a further 148 posts are at various stages of recruitment.  </p><p>  The initiatives described above are designed to assist the Agency in responding to identified service pressures and to provide for a targeted response to such pressures, taking account of identified need and available resources.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of this new water support payment of &euro;100 per annum will be in the region of &euro;42 million in 2015.</p><p>  There are approximately 226,000 people in receipt of fuel allowance who do not receive the household benefits package.  Extending the water support payment to these people would cost in the region of &euro;22.6 million.</p><p>  If the water support was increased to &euro;150 annually, the estimated cost in 2015 would be &euro;63 million, based on the existing cohort of household benefits customers.  Extending a water support payment of &euro;150 to people in receipt of the fuel allowance would cost in the region of an additional &euro;33.9 million.  </p><p>  There are currently approximately 1,750 people in receipt of care&rsquo;s benefit.  Extending household benefits, including water support, to all of these people would cost &euro;1.2 million per annum.  The cost would be less if household benefits were paid only where the carer is living with the person being cared for as is the practice with carer&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  The household benefits package was envisaged as a way of providing some additional support for those who are elderly or on long-term welfare payments.  Issues in relation to all social welfare supports in 2015 are a matter for Government in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</p></reply>

A letter issued on the 10th April 2014 outlining the decision of the deciding officer to refuse the allowance.</p><p>  A review of this decision was requested on 20th August 2014 and additional information on this child&rsquo;s condition/care needs has been supplied. The application together with the new information supplied will now be examined by another medical assessor.  Once their opinion is received the application will be re-examined by a deciding officer and a revised decision will be made, if warranted.

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.5 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2014, representing approx. 33% of overall expenditure. Because of demographic changes the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year. In 2013, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million for the increasing number of pensioners. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p><p>  The adjustments made to the household benefits package in recent years have made it much easier for customers to switch to cheaper energy suppliers, without the loss of any credits they may have built up.  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients. The Department will spend &euro;230 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 411,000 customers.</p><p>  The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities. The living alone allowance was maintained at &euro;7.70 per week.</p><p>  In 2010 the monthly value of the free electricity allowance was &euro;40.70.  It is currently &euro;35.00.  Restoring the allowance to 2010 levels would cost an additional &euro;28 million for 411,000 customers.  Restoring the allowance by 50% would cost an additional &euro;14 million.</p><p>  In 2010 the monthly value of the telephone allowance was &euro;26.  The telephone allowance was discontinued in 2014.  Restoring the telephone allowance to 2010 levels would cost an additional &euro;128 million.  Restoring the allowance by 50% would cost an additional &euro;64 million.</p></reply>

Where there have been individual cases that warranted further attention, these were reviewed at a local level and adjustments made where the circumstances permitted.  The Department continues to monitor expenditure in line with the programme&rsquo;s operational guidelines.  As the Deputy may be aware, an additional &euro;1.3m was allocated to the CE training budget in 2013 in order to support the provision of training to participants.  The CE Financial Review of Schemes in 2012 highlighted that schemes could still operate efficiently and effectively with better targeting of funding and improvements in the administration of the schemes required by the Department.</p><p>  Under the revised funding arrangements agreed with sponsors, schemes were given individual allocations of financial support aimed at meeting the particular costs necessarily incurred by them, having regard to economies made by the scheme and to the overall level of funding available for community employment nationally.</p><p>  Please note that there are 2,000 more places on CE now than in 2012 with an increase in the CE annual budget increased from &euro;352m in 2013 to &euro;357m in 2014.</p><p>  Job Initiative is closed to new entrants since November 2004 and the programme budget is reducing in line with the decreasing participant numbers via exits and retirements. There are currently 1,051 participants and Team Leaders on the JI programme. Over the past 2 years the JI programme has achieved efficiencies in the administration of the order of &euro;2m per annum.</p><p>  The cost of education allowance that formed part of Back to Education Allowance was reduced from &euro;500 to &euro;300 in 2012 and abolished the following year from January 2013. This amounted to a reduction in expenditure of circa &euro;7.8m.</p></reply>

The legal basis of the PPS number is set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) and this legislation sets out the circumstances in which the PPS number can be used.  It also specifically covers the fact that the PPS number can only be used by certain specified bodies and only for the purposes of public service transactions.</p><p>  Irish Water, a registered subsidiary company of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, was incorporated in July 2013, as a semi-state company under the Water Services Act 2013 to bring the water and wastewater services of the 34 Local Authorities together under one national service provider. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014 included an amendment to include Irish Water as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended). This Legislation was enacted on the 17th of July 2014 and it allows Irish Water to request and use the PPS numbers from customers. </p><p>  As part of is functions, Irish Water will be transacting with members of the public and will need to share or confirm data and information in certain cases. The PPS number is being collected by Irish Water for the purpose of validating the identity of customers in order to ensure the proper application of both household and children&rsquo;s water services allowances for which customers may be eligible. </p><p>  The actual arrangements for any required data exchange and validation with the Department are under consideration. Any such arrangements will be subject to compliance with all relevant legislation, including the provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) and the Data Protection Acts. For its part, Irish Water is subject to the onus on public bodies to comply with relevant legislation in terms of the collection, storage and use of all sensitive data including the PPS number.</p><p>  Irish Water has confirmed to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that the data protection notice it has in place is fully compliant with Data Protection requirements and that it is in regular contact with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure this is the case.</p></reply>

Where a claimant has means, the maximum rate of entitlement is reduced by reference to the means in any given case and scheme. It is in the nature of means tested schemes that where means exceed a certain amount, no entitlement exists. It should be noted that the means tests for social assistance schemes operated by the Department are not always identical (for example, the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is more generous than that for other schemes) and that, therefore, the income/asset thresholds at which entitlement ceases can vary across schemes. In addition, certain other organisations operate income/means tested schemes and services and eligibility is a matter for the relevant organisations.  </p><p>  Any changes to means assessment would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, am committed to bringing forward legislation that protects consumers whose mortgages are sold to unregulated entities.

In July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.</p><p>  The Department of Finance received 18 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997.</p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p><p>  This Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30% for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  This was the period during which house prices peaked.  The 30% rate of relief is available regardless of mortgage type and is proportionate to the amount of mortgage interest paid, up to certain ceilings.</p><p>  A mortgage holder qualifies for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period.  In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year. </p></reply>

The estimate for the numbers affected is obtained from an analysis of the income ranges of the same base which the proposals were executed against (to identify how many additional cases would be exempt at each threshold level).  However, it is not possible to accurately infer an &quot;average&quot; saving from the findings of these two different processes.  Instead the actual maximum annual saving to a taxpayer earning up to new proposed thresholds has been included in the table for illustrative purposes.  All these figures are estimated on the basis of no change to the rest of the structure of the USC.<br/><br/>In relation to Question 36400/14 the following table provides a breakdown by rate of the number of individuals who paid USC in 2012 (the most recent tax year for which complete data are available).  <table><tr><th>USC Rate</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Exempt</td><td>523,000</td></tr><tr><td>4%</td><td>267,000</td></tr><tr><td>7%</td><td>1,444,000</td></tr></table>These figures are rounded to the nearest 1,000.  There is a 2% USC rate, applicable to the first &euro;10,036.  However, where an individual's total income for a year does not exceed &euro;10,036, they are exempt from USC, thus there are effectively no cases on the 2% rate.</p></reply>

A public consultation process was undertaken and a number of stakeholder meetings were held.  The review is on-going and it is hoped that a report will be made available in mid October.</p><p>  In relation to question number 36388/14, based on data from tax returns for tax year 2012 it is tentatively estimated that the cost of the proposal could be in the region of &euro;15 million for each year of the accelerated relief.</p><p>  Regarding Questions 36389/14 and 36399/14, the cash flow loss associated with the proposals will depend on the amount of expenditure over the years in question and the extent to which the claimants are able to use the additional relief in each year.  However, on the basis of certain assumptions regarding potential expenditure, the notional cash flow loss associated with a two year capital allowance regime for claims for plant and machinery and buildings by farmers could be up to &euro;60 million for the first year of claim, rising to &euro;120 million in the second year, before the cost starts reducing.</p><p>  On the same basis the loss associated with a three year write off period could be &euro;30 million in the first year of claim, rising to &euro;60 million in the second year and then &euro;90 million in the third year, before the cost starts to reduce.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that sufficient data are not readily available on which to base a reliable estimate of the cost to the Exchequer from the proposals outlined in Questions 36390/14, 36392/14, 36393/14 and 36394/14.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide the specific information requested by the Deputy at this time.</p><p>  There are a number of reliefs where detailed information is not required to be returned to Revenue and therefore no costing is readily available without a detailed review of case records by the Commissioners.  I am informed that the agritaxation review referred to above uses information from a variety of sources to estimate costs for a wider selection of farmer tax reliefs.</p></reply>

The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase. </p><p>  Full relief from capital gains tax will be given where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is equal to or exceeds the consideration for the sale or the other land that is exchanged.  Where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is less than the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged, relief will be given in the same proportion that the consideration for the land that is purchased or exchanged bears to the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged. </p><p>  Provision is made for the clawback of the relief where qualifying land in respect of which relief has been given is disposed of within 5 years of the date of the purchase or exchange of that land.  A clawback does not apply where the disposal arises under a compulsory purchase order. </p><p>  A prerequisite to any disposal and acquisition of farm land qualifying for this relief is that an application for a farm restructuring certificate is made to Teagasc and that Teagasc grants such a certificate (that has not been withdrawn).  Guidelines relating to the application for, and the issue of, a Farm Restructuring Certificate are available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's website. </p><p>  The purpose of the relief is to ensure that the sale and purchase of farm land together lead to a reduction in the distance between parcels of land comprised in a farm, thereby leading to an improvement in the viability of the consolidated farm.  Depending on the circumstances in any particular case, it may be that the disposal of two separate holdings of land and their replacement with a single holding of equal value may qualify as farm restructuring for the purposes of this relief.  This would be a matter for Teagasc to consider in the first instance by reference to the full facts being known.</p><p>  The farm restructuring relief is one of the measures under consideration in the context of the AgriTaxation Review which I announced in my Budget 2014 speech.  The review is be completed shortly and its report is expected to be published around Budget Day.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further in advance of the completion of the review.</p></reply>

Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) sets out the breakdown of EU support for rural development for each EU Member State for the years 2014 &ndash; 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s total EAFRD allocation for rural development is some &euro;2.19 billion (or some &euro;313 million per annum), as agreed at the Multi -annual Financial Framework negotiations in 2013.  EU funding amounts are combined with national co-funding to provide for each Member State&rsquo;s RDP.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, National Exchequer funding brings the total to be spent on RDP schemes in the 2014-2020 period to over &euro;4 billion.

It is currently the subject of discussion with the European Commission whose agreement is required before the scheme and the RDP can come into force.  The proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the quality and environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology.  This will help farmers to maximise productivity in a sustainable way, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd, as set out under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p><p>  The programme will provide support to farmers to take samples for genotyping from selected animals in their herds and to provide vital breeding data to support the development of a national cattle breeding databank.  This data will then be returned to farmers in respect of their own animals and will provide them with the tools to select higher quality and more efficient breeding replacements based on criteria such as ease of calving, high weight gain thereafter, and animals that can be finished earlier.  The scheme will have a substantial environmental dividend while improving productivity, reducing input costs and improving margins for farmers.</p><p>  Payments will, subject to the approval of the programme by the EU Commission, be paid to farmers for work carried out, including the development of a herd breeding plan, training and transaction costs.  Among the activities being considered for the programme are the:</p><p> -  recording of animal events,</p><p> -  recording of a range of performance criteria,</p><p> -  taking and sending for laboratory testing tissue (DNA) samples from selected animals, and</p><p> -  selection of high quality replacement bulls and heifers over the period of their BDGP contract.</p><p> -  Completion of an on-farm Carbon Navigator.</p><p>  A budget of &euro;295 million has been allocated in the draft proposal sent to the Commission.  This &euro;80 is calculated, in accordance with EU requirements, on the basis of the cost incurred and the income foregone by the farmer in completing the actions required under the scheme.  Officials in my Department are currently in discussions with the EU Commission on the final details of the programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-25a.244.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092500048#WRJ01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 to 103, inclusive, together.  <br/><br/>Firstly, may I say that<b></b>all matters relating to the operational enforcement of sea fisheries law are, by Statute, matters appropriate to the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  The SFPA is the independent law enforcement agency of the State for sea fisheries law. <br/><br/>As Minister, I do not have responsibility in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy.  Responsibility in these matters rests with the SFPA.  The SFPA have a challenging job to do.  Its statutory responsibility is to enforce EU and national law under the Common Fisheries Policy.  It also has responsibility to provide a level playing field for everybody in this industry.  If one boat or two or six boats are overfishing deliberately, it is not a victimless crime.  It has an impact on others who are law abiding and who are catching in accordance with the quotas allocated to them.  The market situation for pelagic fish is currently challenging, as Russia has banned the importation of pelagic fish and Russia has been an important market for mackerel, in particular.  If illegally caught fish are being placed on the market, it displaces and reduces prices for those operators, the majority of our industry, who are abiding by the rules set down.  In my view, it is in the interest of the industry as a whole to have strong and fair arrangements in place that give confidence that the rules apply across the board and that all operators are abiding by the quota allocations made available to them. <br/><br/>In order to inform the Deputy, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has sent me a report on the issues that have given rise to the current situation, the actions taken and the current state of consultation between the SFPA and the industry. <br/><br/>Arrangements for the monitoring and control of fisheries is set down in the EU Control Regulation 1224/09.  Article 60(2) of the Council Regulation requires that weighing of fisheries products shall be carried out on landing prior to the fisheries products being held in storage, transported or sold.  The SFPA has allowed a derogation from the EU regulations and permitted the weighing of pelagic fish post-transport in every plant since 2012, based on assurances that proper systems and procedures that accurately recorded catches were in place in these plants. <br/><br/>However, there have been substantial indications that fish have been landed in weights that exceed those recorded by the weighing systems in factories.  These indications have arisen through the routine course of the SFPA&rsquo;s work and as a result of joint inspections with other organisations, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The SFPA has set out some of the issues that gave rise to concerns.  These include a high level of divergence between spot checks by the SFPA and the official factory weight, even taking account of some divergence relating to water content.  A trend of individual trucks recording substantially more fish when subject to an SFPA official control compared to instances when not subject to such controls.  One instance involved a simple on-off switch on the belt weigher in a factory which had the effect of allowing the belt to transit fish without being recorded on the meter.  If used in this way, fish would not be weighed or recorded. <br/><br/>The permits which allow in-factory weighting have lapsed due to the SFPA&rsquo;s overall lack of confidence in the operation of the weighing systems.  The SFPA has entered into discussions with both catchers and processors to implement systems and procedures that will restore confidence in the weighing systems in factories.  The SFPA have set out to the factories certain requirements necessary before permits can be granted, allowing the renewal of in-factory weighing.  These requirements include provisions to give assurances that weigh belts in the factories when moving are recording.  They include confirmation of product flows into and out of the plant and checks involving weighing of a sample of landings on the pier side as a means of validating factory weighing.<br/><br/>Several pelagic fish factories have over recent days applied for permits under the new requirements, albeit generally qualified by statements around non-acceptance of some of the requirements described by SFPA.  These applications are currently being considered by the SFPA.  The representative bodies for the Irish pelagic industry have acknowledged the need for change.  However, they are not to date willing to support the SFPA requirement for a continuous remote monitoring facility to increase assurances of accurate recording.  Furthermore, they are not to date willing to provide stock movement records at the level of detail of the SFPA request. Irish catchers have said they are not willing to move to recognise the validity of weighing at landing, even as a component cross checking arrangement of an overall system of supporting factory permits.<br/><br/>I understand and appreciate that the new arrangements sought by the SFPA for the effective control of pelagic fisheries involve some changes in practices. However, in the long run, I believe that it will be in the interests of the industry as a whole to commit to strengthened controls that give all catchers and processors assurances that there is a level playing field across the industry.  I would encourage the industry to continue its dialogue with the SFPA.  The SFPA is currently considering existing applications for in factory weighing permits and is awaiting further applications from the remainder of the factories.  If there are additional technical issues to be sorted out, the SFPA have assured me that it remains available for further discussion with industry representatives.</p></reply>

A pilot programme is currently in operation which allows visa required nationals seeking to undertake certain degree programmes in Ireland  to provide an alternative to bank statements as a method of proof of finances.  The alternative method is an "education bond" with a minimum value of &euro;7,000.  The bond must be lodged to an approved student fees payment service and must be held continuously from the initial visa application through to the time the student registers in Ireland with the immigration authorities. Currently the courses allowable under this alternative arrangement are limited to Degree Programme courses delivered by certain types of institution which I understand can include the Institutes of Technology.

When I have had the opportunity to complete consideration of the issues, proposals will be brought to Government in the usual manner.</p><p>  I would draw attention to the existing legislative provision addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.</p><p>  There is also provisions in our criminal law directed at the public nuisances and exploitation associated with prostitution.  Solicitation, by both the client and the prostitute, living on the earnings of prostitution, organising prostitution and running a brothel are all offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. Currently, 4,330 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA. Direct Provision owes its origin as the public policy response to a major accommodation crisis that existed in the late 1990s / early 2000s. At its high point in 2005 the number of persons residing in Direct Provision was 8080.</p><p>  A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which provided for asylum seekers to live independent lives in individual housing with associated social welfare payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' towards the State it would clearly create, the cost to the exchequer could be possibly double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. The report is available in full on the agency's website on www.ria.gov.ie.</p><p>  In terms of the cost of replacing the Direct Provision system with private rented accommodation, it is difficult to calculate what that cost would be. The number of persons seeking asylum  this year is currently  running at 40% higher than last. This, invariably, creates additional pressures and challenges for the State. Asylum seekers are not obliged to avail of direct provision supports and a significant number choose to make their own arrangements in the absence of an alternative. Should a system be introduced whereby such persons could effectively avail of mainstream social welfare supports, including rent supplement in line with those available to Irish citizens, it would be logical to expect that the numbers seeking such State supports could increase significantly with costs rising accordingly. It would also be logical to expect an increase in the number of economic migrants seeking to enter the State via the asylum system. Therefore, any change to the current Direct Provision system must be given careful consideration.</p><p>  The Government is committed to making real improvements to the protection process, including direct provision.  We have made a number of commitments to this end in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016.  This includes a commitment to establish an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements to the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers.</p><p>  My intention is to proceed with the establishment of that Working Group in the near future.  Together with Minister of State O&rsquo;R&iacute;orda&iacute;n, I hosted a Round Table on 18 September to provide non-governmental organisations active in the field of asylum the opportunity to outline the key issues for them in relation to the State's current arrangements for asylum seekers.  That initiative was widely welcomed by the NGOs involved and proved very useful for the purpose of identifying the issues which will need to be addressed.  I will be using the outcome of that meeting to inform the terms of reference of the Working Group which I expect to establish shortly.  </p></reply>

The Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mother and Baby Homes, along with the views expressed by interested parties, is informing this task. One of the key recommendations in this Report is that the Commission on Mother and Baby Homes should not repeat the work of previous investigations, in particular the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. It is noted that the institution mentioned in the details supplied by the Deputy, falls within those categories of &lsquo;institutions&rsquo; already examined in detail by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.

Considerable progress has been achieved to date in this important task, including the publication of the Inter-Departmental Group&rsquo;s Report and the announcement that Judge Yvonne Murphy will Chair this independent statutory investigation.  It is my intention to bring a Memorandum to Government as quickly as possible setting out the proposed Terms of Reference and to return to the Houses with a draft order to establish the Commission.</p><p>  Discussions in this regard are on-going with the Attorney General and colleagues across Government with a view to finalising our deliberations in early course. In parallel with this work, my Department is advancing the legislative and logistical arrangements required to establish the Commission. </p><p>  Given the breadth and scale of the issues involved, and our experience of previous statutory inquiries, it is apparent that precise terms of reference are required to ensure the Commission is set up on the most sound footing possible. This is a complex undertaking and it is right to take the necessary time for drafting to ensure the Commission can deliver on public expectations in a realistic manner. </p><p>  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, previously met with representatives of a number of key advocacy groups and Church leaders, including the Adoption Rights Alliance, First Mothers Group, Bethany Homes Survivors Group, C&uacute;namh, Adoption Loss and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin. I have also recently met with Archbishop Michael Jackson. The submissions made during these constructive discussions, together with more than 120 written submissions received by my Department, are a valuable input to the deliberative process.  </p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Group&rsquo;s Report has served to stimulate and further inform public debate on these important matters. As matters progress in the coming weeks it is my intention to arrange further engagements with opposition spokespersons and other stakeholders in order to update them on the emerging issues and seek their further views. I am confident that this inclusive approach will assist in establishing an inquiry which is capable of effectively addressing these important matters in a sensitive and timely manner.</p></reply>

The EWS of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015/16 academic year.</p><p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.</p><p>  The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children, or 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of those figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. This analysis will be published before the end of 2014.</p></reply>

In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br/><br/>A second free pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000-5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time. <br/><br/>However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Early Years Quality Agenda that is being progressed by my Department, and which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  My Department and I will be keeping this commitment under review in the context of the progress of the Early Years Quality Agenda.<br/><br/>The approximate additional extra cost of  extending the ECCE programme is:<br/><br/>4 hours per day, five days per week, for 38 weeks=&euro;58m<br/><br/>5 hours per day, five days per week, for 38 weeks=&euro;117m<br/><br/>6 hours per day, five days per week, for 38 weeks=&euro;175m<br/><br/>3 hours per day, five days per week, for 44 weeks=&euro;27.66m<br/><br/>3 hours per day, five days per week, for 46 weeks=&euro;36.88m<br/><br/>3 hours per day, five days per week, for 48 weeks=&euro;46.10m<br/><br/>It should be noted that there are factors outside cost which would impact on policy decisions in this area.  For example a programme that lasted for a 6 hour day would be very onerous for young children, and programmes that extended outside the primary school year could be difficult for parents to manage.</p></reply>

The campus has a designated liaison officer who is available to all children and reviews any complaints made by young people. The Ombudsman for Children's Office has engaged with the Campus Manager in Oberstown on their role in the complaints process.  Complaints may also be with made to by a child to advocacy services such as Empowering People in Care (EPIC).  The Oberstown campus is also subject to review and audit under the normal public financial procedures.  In the absence of more detailed information it is not possible to comment further.  If the Deputy has information about any specific matter I will arrange for it to be examined by my Department in conjunction with management on the Oberstown campus.</p></reply>

In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve, approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning.  My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in various fora in developing  key initiatives. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of the national youth organisations, Government departments and the Education and Training Boards, that support youth services at local level, has an important advisory role to me in matters to do with provision for young people. My Department has  worked with the youth sector on the development of youth work reponses to the challenges of youth unemployment, including the contribution that the youth services can make to the Government's employment agenda and the Action Plan For Jobs, 2014.  </p><p>  The youth sector is engaged in the development, by my Department, of the new National Youth Strategy 2014- 2020.  The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people, aged 10 to 24 years, while having particular regard to those young people who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and, therefore, in most need of support.  In consultation with the National Youth York Advisory Committee, my Department has set up  a National Youth Strategy Task Group to oversee the development of the new strategy.  The Task Group, which meets regularly, is chaired by the Director of the National Youth Council of Ireland and comprises representatives from the youth sector, Government departments, Education and Training Boards, the Centre for Effective Services and the business community.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be completed by my Department for the end of 2014.</p><p>   I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups. Earlier this month, over 2 days, I met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations. My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p></reply>

Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Children and Family Agency, Tusla services and if necessary is followed by an initial assessment of the nature and degree of any harm and an assessment of the child's needs.</p><p>  The Agency has advised that  there were 4,641 referrals for child abuse during quarter one of 2014 - 1,037 (22%) of these referrals received related to a concern of physical abuse - 1,576 (34%) related to a concern of emotional abuse - 806 (18%)  related to sexual abuse and 1,222 (26%) referrals received related to neglect.  Following the preliminary enquiry by the Agency of the 4641 referrals, there was a reduction by 41% in the number of individual cases going on to have an initial assessment. The reasons for this included the duplication of referrals, the child being known to the service and receiving attention, or that the referral was not appropriate for the agency.</p><p>  The Agency publishes a range of reports on performance indicators on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Among these indicators is information relating to referral and assessment processes, and numbers of substantiated cases which have led to a child's name being placed on the Child Protection Notification System and having a Child Protection Plan. The Agency also provides an annual Review of Adequacy Report under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991. The annual service planning process provides an opportunity to set out service priorities in the context of available resources.  In addition, information is provided to me by the Agency on specific issues as required or to inform me of policy or legislative issues arising in the services.</p><p>  My Department's function is exercised through a range of interactions with officials in the Agency.

Correspondence of this nature is referred to the Department of Education and Skills. Issues raised in correspondence received that raise child welfare and protection concerns would be referred to the Child and Family Agency.<br/><br/>The new procedures under the Action Plan for Bullying, led by the Department of Education and Skills, which place a requirement on all schools to address incidences of bullying, are highly relevant to the contexts of young people&rsquo;s lives and not only in the school setting. They  specifically include incidences of cyber-bullying that occur both in and out of the school context and the posting of hurtful messages, images or statements on social media sites, within the definition of bullying. They highlight the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely and to know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities. The Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. <br/><br/>There is a range of support services, supported by various departments and their agencies, including my own Department, which can assist children and young people in coping with bullying situations. These include advice and guidance for families. For example, <i>www.webwise.ie</i>- an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills - provides information and advice for parents and teachers about risks and how to protect children against cyber bullying. At community level, many of the voluntary youth services funded by my Department provide education programmes, run awareness campaigns about bullying and provide programmes for young people to give them the knowledge and skills to build supportive links and counter bullying behaviours.<br/><br/>Revised <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children </i>was published in 2011. The aim of <i>Children First</i>is to direct the identification, investigation, assessment, reporting, treatment and management of child abuse. Bullying is defined in section 9.4 of the National Guidance, as repeated aggression that is conducted by an individual or group against others.

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2,   Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p><p>  Youth organisations and projects in receipt of funding are required to complete an annual application form for my Department.

These include advice and guidance for families. For example, <i>www.webwise.ie</i>- an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills - provides information and advice for parents and teachers about risks and how to protect children against cyber bullying. At community level, many of the voluntary youth services funded by my Department provide education programmes, run awareness campaigns about bullying and provide programmes for young people to give them the knowledge and skills to build supportive links and counter bullying behaviours.<br/><br/>The new procedures under the Action Plan for Bullying, led by the Department of Education and Skills, which place a requirement on all schools to address incidences of bullying, are highly relevant to the contexts of young people&rsquo;s lives and not only in the school setting. They specifically include incidences of cyber bullying that occur both in and out of the school context and the posting of hurtful messages, images or statements on social media sites, within the definition of bullying. They highlight the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely and to know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities. The Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. <br/><br/>Under <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>serious incidents of bullying should be reported to the Child and Family Agency. I have been advised that, in such cases and where it is required, appropriate support will be put in place. In addition to support for the family and the child or young adult, which can be provided by the Child and Family Agency, there are services provided by the HSE, including the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services,which may be relevant depending on the nature of the condition being experienced by a child or young adult. <br/><br/>My Department continues to work with other departments, child care services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people, to improve access to information and support for them and their families and to advance measures to combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

BOBF comprehends the continuum from infancy through early and middle childhood to adolescence and early adulthood.  It provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.  </p><p>  As provided for in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020, the Department of Social Protection, under Commitment 4.2, has lead responsibility for a national child-specific social target to lift 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level. This target will include reducing the poverty rate for households with children, which is consistently higher when compared to non-child households and for children as compared to adults. It is expected that this commitment will be addressed on a cross-departmental basis.</p><p>  My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to child and youth poverty. It is, for example, leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood Programme.  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.</p><p>  In terms of other provision, my Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on three child care support programmes which provide child care to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. </p><p>  My Department also provides funding for targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through three schemes.  The three programmes are Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and Local Drugs Task Force. Projects. In addition, national and regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. In 2014, current funding of &euro;49.78 million has been provided to my Department for these schemes.    </p><p>  The Youth Work Sector has a significant role to play in young people&rsquo;s personal and social development and progression and improving outcomes for all young people, including those in most need of support and at risk of poverty. The sector has particular expertise in working with young people and provides non-formal and informal learning opportunities which aid young people&rsquo;s preparedness, participation, and progression in key areas of their lives such as education, inclusion and employment.</p><p>  The National Youth Strategy 2014 - 2020 which being developed by my Department as a constituent strategy of  BOBF in collaboration with other Government departments and youth interests will have a particular focus on ensuring greater coordination in policy and provision across government for young people aged 10 &ndash; 24 years. The National Youth Strategy is for all young people aged 10 to 24 years, spanning the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 and will aim to be responsive to current and emerging issues which impact on young people&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>  Within this universal strategy, there will be particular regard to young people experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and in most need of support. It will set out the cross-cutting actions that will improve the effectiveness of services in supporting young people to attain the national outcomes. The Strategy will be evidence informed and implementation focused, with priorities underpinned by realistic and achievable actions tied to specific outcomes and measurable indicators.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-25a.418.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092500055#WRQ01600"><p>My Department commissioned the Centre for Effective Services (CES) to undertake a review of the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy, 2001 to establish the extent that the strategy has been successful and to identify any blockages or challenges to its implementation. The report found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless.</p><p>  It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.</p><p>Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991. Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties. These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services. Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18 birthday.</p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living. The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements. Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes. It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.</p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.</p><p>  The prioritisation of services for young people receiving aftercare is considered in the context of the statutory and administrative criteria and rules relating to State provision of services and the requirement of all State bodies to provide services in accordance with resources available to them. The Agency and officials of the DCYA have been and continue to explore these matters further with the relevant Departments and agencies, on a bilateral basis, to continue to support the improvement of aftercare for this vulnerable cohort.</p><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1 April, considered the draft aftercare provisions. The Committee&rsquo;s report on the Bill was made available to the Department in mid-July and is currently under consideration, prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p></reply>

Particular regard is had to the youth work needs of young people between the ages of 10 and 21, and to those who are socially or economically disadvantaged.<br/><br/>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations.

Funding is also made available for a network of Youth Information Centres throughout the country.  The purpose of these Centres is to provide young people and those who work with them, with access to information on rights, opportunities, benefits, health, welfare and other matters. <br/><br/>The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. Information about the funding schemes and the provision of youth services is available on my Department&rsquo;s Website at .<br/><br/>A wide and diverse range of programmes and activities are organised by youth services and projects throughout the country, for and with young people. These include programmes to promote personal and social development, including activities to encourage healthy lifestyles, physical and mental well-being and initiatives to raise awareness of the risks associated with drugs and alcohol abuse and other issues that impact on young people&rsquo;s lives and their engagement in their local communities.<br/><br/>Programmes and activities are organised and delivered at local level by professional youth workers in projects and well trained volunteers. This work is supported by a network of Youth Officers in the Education and Training Boards. <br/><br/>Youth Officers are a key resource in the co-ordination of youth service provision to my Department and a contact point in their respective localities. They have an important support role to the providers of youth services in the implementation of the National Quality Standards Framework &ndash; a Framework to ensure that the diverse range of programmes available for young people have a common approach to ensuring quality services that draw on best practice and are responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs. The National Youth Organisations that support the local services are the key contacts for information about the range and choice of youth facilities and youth programmes available to young people and how to access them. <br/><br/>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department is engaged in an on-going basis with the providers of youth services throughout the country and with the network of Youth Officers. My Department works collaboratively with those key contacts, including the various structured Fora, to ensure that they have access to the tools and best practice resources that are available to support their work with young people. <br/><br/>Details of the Websites of the major national youth organisations is being compiled and will be forwarded to the deputy shortly.</p></reply>

Of all deliberate self harm cases, 37% resulted in admission to a ward of the treating hospital and 53% of cases were discharged following treatment in the emergency department.<br/><br/>Government policy on deliberate self-harm and suicide prevention is guided by our national strategy <i>Reach Out </i>which makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, reducing stigma and promoting positive mental health, initiatives aimed at helping young men and research.  The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has primary responsibility for the implementation of <i>Reach Out.</i><br/><br/>Action Area 12 in <i>Reach Out</i>aims to<i>&quot;Develop and resource an effective response in the health services or people who present to services having engaged in deliberate self harm and design ways to reach out to those who self-harm but are reluctant to access traditional services and supports&quot;.  </i>In this regard, the NOSP fund a range of services including Pieta House; two on-line providers - SpunOut and Inspire Ireland, to provide direct information to parents, teachers and young people on self harm; a self-harm liaison nurse post in Temple Street Hospital; training for community gatekeepers and front-line services responding to self-harm from young people.  In 2012 the NOSP also published an information leaflet for parents on dealing with and responding to self- harm.  In addition, this Government has provided funding for an 232 additional posts for the development of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) teams since 2012, with approximately 190 in post by the end of June 2014.<br/><br/>Having regard to the resources available, and the many competing demands on the mental health services, I am satisfied that there is an adequate wide range of support services in place for children and teenagers identified as having a tendency to self-harm.</p></reply>

The HSE has now completed the exercise and eligibility has been restored to 11,383 people in accordance with the Government decision.  Final quality assurance tasks are in progress and enquiries can be made by calling 1890 252 919 - Monday to Friday - 8am to 8pm.  At the time of the Government decision it was estimated that up to 15,305 people could have their cards restored.  As the files have been reviewed in recent weeks it has become clear that some individuals included in the original estimate are no longer ill, some have had cards restored to one member of the family (as opposed to the entire family) and some have passed away.</p><p>  This information is not available in tabular form on a monthly basis as it was not collated in that manner.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<br/><br/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. Biogen Idec's Irish management indicated to the HSE in November 2013 that it intended to re-submit an application in April 2014. The HSE has advised it received a revised application from Biogen Idec on Friday 25th July. This application is currently being assessed in line with the agreed procedures and timescales. No further comment is possible at this time as the HSE decision making process is ongoing.</p></reply>

The key response is the establishment of an ex-gratia payment scheme, which will cost around &euro;34 million.  In addition, there is a commitment to the continued provision of medical services, including medical cards for the women.<br/><br/>This followed Government&rsquo;s examination of a report carried out by Professor Oonagh Walsh, on <i>Practice of Symphysiotomy in Ireland, between 1944 and 1984; </i>and<i></i>an <i>Independent Review of Issues relating to Symphysiotomy </i>by Judge Yvonne Murphy which advised Government, inter alia, on the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and/or other parties in relation to symphysiotomy and on the merits and costs of proceeding with an ex gratia scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.  <br/><br/>Judge Murphy outlined the case for a scheme in her report and her recommendations on levels of awards were accepted by Government.  Subsequently, I asked Judge Murphy to draw up a detailed draft scheme. I have consulted through the summer with the Judge and have also been speaking to relevant parties about the proposed scheme.  Judge Murphy submitted her more detailed proposal to me on 11 September, setting out how the scheme should operate.  In this context I met the support groups representing women who have undergone symphysiotomy last Friday. I wanted to hear from the support groups how they hope the scheme will operate, and to confirm to them that the scheme will be established as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Key aspects of the proposed scheme include: <br/><br/>- Women who had a surgical symphysiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990 may apply in accordance with, and subject to the terms of the scheme. <br/><br/>- The scheme will be run by an independent Assessor.  If women have questions on any aspect of the scheme, the Assessor or secretariat, will be available to assist. <br/><br/>- The scheme will be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial. It will allow women to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application.  It will result in awards of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;150,000 for the women.<br/><br/>- Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy and have medical evidence to prove it may accept an award of &euro;50,000 without further assessment. If no medical records are available a medical assessment will be carried out.<br/><br/>- For those who wish to apply for higher awards (&euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000)  a medical assessment may be necessary if  up to date medical records are not available, or if the Assessor decides this is needed for final determination of the award. <br/><br/>- Women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a pre-condition to participating in the scheme.  Women may opt out at any stage in application and assessment process, up to the time of accepting their awards.  However, on accepting the offer of the award under the Scheme, women will have to agree to discontinue their legal proceedings against any party arising out of their symphysiotomy.<br/><br/>I intend to finalise the details of the scheme shortly and will bring a Memorandum to Government requesting approval to appoint an Assessor for the scheme instead of it being administered by the State Claims Agency and to a small number of other amendments to the Government decision of last July.  The details concerning the scheme and its commencement date will be advertised in national and other media, as decided by the Assessor.  I hope that when the women see the details of the scheme and the efforts made to ensure it is person-centred, simple and non-adversarial many of them will opt to join the scheme.<br/><br/>In agreeing to the ex-gratia scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is aware also of  the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.</p></reply>

The move towards individualised budgeting in the disability sector also mirrors the wider changes in the health and social care sector described in <i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &ndash; 2015.</i><br/><br/>The move towards the development and implementation of a national individualised budgeting framework raises legal and practical issues, and will require careful consideration and planning. <i>Future Health</i>explains that central to the introduction of individualised budgeting will be suitable financial systems; transparent and comprehensive governance arrangements; a National Standard Needs Assessment framework; underpinning legislation and the introduction of a regulatory system for providers to ensure quality and safety for the recipients of social services.<br/><br/>Demonstration projects are already underway to examine the practical aspects of introducing this major change in the disability sector and to establish the costs and benefits.  An analysis of the projects will be necessary to determine their wider applicability, clarify the issues which must be resolved before the projects can be scaled up, and identify the best way forward.  The completion of this analysis is a primary recommendation in the VFM Review and is required for all significant public service expenditure proposals.<br/><br/>In relation to the specifics in this particular case, I have referred this question to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The HPRA is responsible for determining the method of sale and supply of a medicine and also determining whether it should be available on prescription, or not.</p><p>  The HPRA is committed to the current Irish health care policy which aims, where appropriate, to provide patients with increased access to safe medicines, at the lowest level of complexity and cost.  In July 2014, the HPRA published a list of 12 active substances contained in medicines currently classified as prescription-only medicines (POM), which could be safely reclassified to be available for sale &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; (OTC) in pharmacies. This list includes products for the treatment of migraine, acid-reflux symptoms, hay fever, cold sores, muscle pain and inflammation, fungal skin and nail infections and other inflammatory skin conditions.</p><p>  This was a significant development. It represented the outcome of measures which have been undertaken by the HPRA to explore unmet needs in the availability of non-prescription medicines in Ireland. It also follows recommendations made by an independent consultative panel established by the HPRA to specifically assist its review of this area.</p><p>  Arising from the publication of the above mentioned list, expressions of interest in reclassification of certain medicines have been received from the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs). The HPRA is now working with manufacturers and MAHs to progress.</p><p>  In reclassifying a medicine there are number of factors that need to be considered. These include the safety profile of the product, the proposed condition for treatment, the expected duration of use, the suitability of a condition for self diagnosis with or without the intervention of a pharmacist, the potential for interactions with other medicines and the possibility of misuse. In the relation to the medicines highlighted by the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) (fluconazole, chlorampenicol and aspirin), the decision on reclassification is more complex due to additional safety concerns relating to the use of these medicines. The HPRA is continuing to review these concerns.</p><p>  HPRA will continue to consider medicines which may be suitable for reclassification.</p></reply>

It should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of doctors with expertise in using the product and with a full understanding of the risks of therapy and the monitoring requirements. It has never been approved for use in the treatment of cancer in Ireland.</p><p>   The currently available product information (i.e. Summary of Product Characteristics and package leaflet) for Roaccutane has been the subject of a number of changes since 1998.  As with all medicines, any change to this information requires approval by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (or another EU Member State) on foot of a formal application to vary the authorisation and the submission of relevant supporting data. In practice, product information is frequently updated as new data become available through various sources of post-marketing experience, including further studies, literature reviews, evaluation of adverse reaction data etc.  In this context there have been numerous updates and changes to the product information for Roaccutane from January 1998, until now.</p><p>  If the Deputy seeks more detailed information on the changes to product information , it would be helpful if the specific concerns he would like addressed were specified. </p></reply>

Mathematics and numeracy permeate so many aspects of the curriculum. The aim is to develop skills at the level and rate that suits the young person's abilities (and disabilities). <br/><br/>  Examinations at post-primary level are designed to provide opportunities for candidates across the achievement range to show what they know, understand and can do so as to be fair to candidates and to facilitate a spread of grades across the available range. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) operates a Scheme of Reasonable Accommodations at the Certificate Examinations (RACE scheme).  The scheme is designed to assist candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations. Within the context of the RACE scheme the term 'special need' applies to candidates who have a physical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or a specific learning difficulty.</p></reply>

In addition, a further 28% of school leavers progress directly on to a PLC or other further/second level course. <br/><br/>  Generally speaking, over 64% of any final year second level cohort will ultimately transfer to a third level institution before reaching the mature student age.  If mature students are factored in, the Higher Education Authority estimates that the figure rises to around 69%. <br/><br/>  Annual statistical data provided by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) indicate that 49% of new entrants to higher education in 2012-13 went to the universities, 46% to the Institutes of Technology and 5% to other colleges.  HEA figures include entrants who progress on to higher education directly from school, as well as those who progress at a later stage or as mature students.  The vast majority (81%) of higher education entrants are age 17-20 years. <br/><br/>  In August, the HEA published a consultation paper on the development of the next national access plan for higher education.  This paper included estimates of participation rates in higher education in 2011 among the 18-20 year old age cohort of young people from each Dublin postal district.  It should be noted that as well as young people completing the leaving certificate, this population would include a number who left school before that point, who may be in the labour force (employed or unemployed) or in further education or training. <br/><br/>  The following table shows the estimated participation rates by Dublin postal code for (i) entrants to higher education of all ages and (ii) entrants to higher education from the 18-20 year old age cohort. <table><tr><th>Postcode</th><th>2011 Admission Rate (All ages)</th><th>2011 Admission Rate (Age 18-20) </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin1</td><td>51%</td><td>23%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin2</td><td>47%</td><td>26%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin3</td><td>76%</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin4</td><td>105%</td><td>84%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin5</td><td>63%</td><td>47%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin6</td><td>127%</td><td>99%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin6w</td><td>102%</td><td>82%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin7</td><td>63%</td><td>41%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin8</td><td>63%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin9</td><td>76%</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin10</td><td>26%</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin11</td><td>42%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin12</td><td>52%</td><td>37%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin13</td><td>45%</td><td>36%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin14</td><td>88%</td><td>76%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin15</td><td>69%</td><td>47%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin16</td><td>95%</td><td>79%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin17</td><td>21%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin18</td><td>66%</td><td>58%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin20</td><td>38%</td><td>32%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin22</td><td>38%</td><td>26%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin24</td><td>39%</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin County</td><td>67%</td><td>53%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Total</td><td>62%</td><td>47%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Accordingly, the Department advised ETBs in February 2014 that they were not required to submit the minutes of each Board meeting to the Department and to discontinue the practice with immediate effect.

However, Boards were only constituted in accordance with the requirements of Section 30 of the Act in August and September of 2014 and my Department took the view that it would be more appropriate to wait until the newly constituted Boards were operational before commencing the service plan process.  Accordingly, it is intended that service plans will be in place in 2015.<br/><br/>  Section 27 of the Act requires the preparation and adoption of s strategy statement by each ETB.  However, this has not commenced to date in view of the significant work the ETBS have undertaken in 2014 relation to the amalgamation of the VECs and incorporation of the training function formerly undertaken by F&Aacute;S.

The number of pupils enrolled in individual schools is provided in the National School Annual Census and refers to the number of pupils enrolled as of the 30th of September in the given academic year.  The National School Annual Census is generally returned by schools to the Department by end October. The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to primary schools is published annually. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year are set out in Circular 0007/2014 which is available on the Department website. <br/><br/>  The staffing schedule includes the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for September 2014. In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. <br/><br/>  In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level was extended for the current school year to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. Circular 0007/2014 provides details for schools wishing to make an appeal.<br/><br/>  The allocation of all teaching posts is contingent on compliance with redeployment arrangements. The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies. The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. <br/><br/>  I believe that allocating resources based on projected enrolments for the coming school year is not practical and would impact negatively on the teacher allocation and redeployment process and the timeframes in which this process is completed.</p></reply>

However, the decision to abolish the grants was not taken lightly, and it has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible. In making difficult decisions such as this, priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children. <br/><br/>  The requirement for two separate two week placements is part of the Teaching Council's revised requirements for Gaeilge in  Initial Teacher Education. The DES supports the changes as they contribute to overall quality improvement.<br/><br/>  For the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position at this time to reinstate funding to this area. In 2012 my Department paid a total  of &euro;862,682 to Irish Summer Colleges in respect of student teachers' attendance at Gaeltacht courses.</p></reply>

The review considered a wide range of options. It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will, subject to Government approval, be incorporated into the General Scheme of a new Planning Bill, which is expected to be published shortly. It would not be appropriate to set out the findings of the review until the Government has had the opportunity to consider them, but it is my intention to publish the Housing Agency&rsquo;s review in due course.   </p><p>  As the extent of social housing gain from Part V is directly related to private housing construction, the current situation is that there is very limited Part V delivery in terms of social housing.

I believe that the Part V mechanism has the potential to again be a significant contributor to social housing in the context of a recovering housing market.   </p><p>  The Government's Construction 2020 strategy, published in May 2014, aims to build a competitive, innovative, and sustainable construction sector. My intention is that the Social Housing Strategy, required under Action 8 of Construction 2020 and now in preparation, will be both challenging and innovative, and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland.

These organisations include voluntary housing associations.<br/><br/>Since the late 1980s, close to 25,000 units of accommodation have been provided under capital funding schemes underpinned by mortgages. More recently, a scheme was introduced that provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the property value to facilitate AHBs in raising private finance to acquire or build new social housing units. The capital advanced is repayable at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually after 30 years.<br/><br/>Under the terms of these various funding schemes, AHBs are the <i>de facto</i>owners of these properties and are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.  My Department cannot unilaterally make provision for their sale to tenants. Any such decision would have to involve the AHB concerned and have regard to the mortgage on the property. On expiry of the mortgage period and subject to compliance with the terms of the funding agreement, the AHB becomes the owner of the property.<br/><br/>Section 45 of the Housing (scellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 does provide for the sale by housing authorities and AHBs of designated new houses to eligible households, subject to specified terms and conditions. However, any such sales would have to be done in consultation with AHBs. There are currently no proposals or plans for a tenant purchase scheme in relation to AHB houses and therefore no costings have been developed.</p></reply>

Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within seven years of the expiry of the permission authorising the development, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners of the units concerned.  The decision as to whether an estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a local authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the local authority considers that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  </p><p>  Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities.

However, it is aware of problems with some water services infrastructure that was provided by developers and which is not connected to the public network.

While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. This data collection exercise has been initiated and will inform future actions. Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending the outcome of the review.</p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity. In such cases, borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. </p></reply>

The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges and allowances. The CER is currently reviewing submissions received on the consultation and a determination will be made by the CER later this month. Full details of the CER public consultation are available on <i>.</i><br/><br/>In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the water charges plan, the CER must take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act in July 2014. This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance.  The policy direction also requires that special provision be made for customers of Irish Water who have specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption, involving capping of charges at the relevant assessed charge.The direction also indicates that the medical conditions to be covered will be set out following consultation with the nister for Health. I hope to conclude the necessary consultation shortly and announce arrangements in advance of 1 October 2014.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package. The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure are be ing developed by the Department of Social Protection.There are no plans to provide additional allowances or affordability measure s , other than those announced in the Government decision.</p></reply>

The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the water charges plan to be prepared by Irish Water is subject to the approval of the CER. <br/><br/>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre, which came into effect at the end of 2013. At this concentration, there is a risk of exceeding the limits wherever there is lead piping and in particular where the water has been sitting in the pipe overnight. Irish Water has informed my Department that of its estimated 58,000 kilometres of distribution system, there is a very small proportion of lead piping, consisting of approximately 190 short lengths across 14 local authorities. Irish Water is working on the replacement of these pipes as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>However, there are a significant number of lead public service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter. Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the meter installation programme. The numbers currently being identified are about 5% of houses, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas. Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared lead backyard service connections. Irish Water has informed my Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections over the next ten years. Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure that they can mitigate the risk in the short term. Given the age of the housing stock in Waterford c ity and some areas of the c ounty and the presence of back yard services, the percentage of houses with lead plumbing could be higher than the estimated national average. A number of schemes were carried out to replace these pipes in recent years in Waterford City by the City Council and Irish Water will continue this programme.<br/><br/>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system and shall ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner. As a precaution, Irish Water recommends persons in premises that have lead piping, to flush the supply at the kitchen tap first thing in the morning, before using for drinking. <br/><br/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions. The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. <br/><br/>The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges and allowances. The CER is currently reviewing submissions received on the consultation and a determination will be made by the CER later this month.Full details of the CER public consultation are available on </p></reply>

Through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.<br/><br/>Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention.

I am aware also that there are extensive plans for the commercial rollout of high speed services in Kildare. <br/><br/>As part of the mapping process, an initial stakeholder consultation on certain technical aspects of the proposed Plan was launched in June with a deadline of 15th September. 31 submissions were received as part of this process and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses will be published over the coming weeks. <br/><br/>I expect to publish the maps for public consultation later this year. These will include details of the areas requiring State intervention. It is important to note that these maps will be dynamic and will be subject to change if new commercial investments as announced in the future. <br/><br/>A further public consultation on a proposed comprehensive intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015. <br/><br/>EU State Aid clearance will be required for the proposed State intervention. My Department will be working closely with the European Commission on this important aspect of the programme.<br/><br/>Finally, a detailed procurement process will have to be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) prior to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and for my Department. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way.

The publication commenced a period of public consultation under which written contributions were sought by the end of July. <br/><br/>1,241 submissions were received. My Department has conducted an initial analysis of the valuable contributions made by interested parties, and the key issues raised in relation to each of the areas set out have been identified. Further engagement with stakeholders is ongoing and will continue over the coming months, firstly through seminars to be hosted by officials from my Department on all of the priorities set out in the Green Paper, to ensure that all of the issues identified in the submissions are fully understood. My Department is focussed on ensuring that the assumptions on which the final policy paper will be written are tested and accurate, so as to produce a dynamic and responsive evidence based framework which will facilitate us in steering an appropriate course as we seek to address sustainability, security and competitiveness challenges and opportunities.<br/><br/>Further engagement will be arranged in order to obtain views from as wide a spectrum as possible, including from consumers and local communities in addition to other key stakeholders. There is an absolute necessity for the final policy paper to set a balanced, robust and enabling framework for Ireland&rsquo;s Energy transition. <br/><br/>At an event hosted by my Department on 24 September to launch the next phase of the policy development process, I announced that I will chair a Steering Group which will advise on the finalisation of the policy. John FitzGerald, Research Professor at the Economic and Social Research Insitute, Dr. Brian Motherway, Chief Executive of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, and Ms. Helen Donoghue, formerly of DG Energy at the European Commission, have accepted my invitation to participate on a Steering Group, together with officials from my Department. <br/><br/>Drafting of the policy paper will begin after the planned seminars are completed at the end of this year. The text of the policy paper will be progressed during the first half of 2015 with a view to publication of the final policy paper by September 2015. The new energy policy framework will be timely in that it will be guided by Ireland&rsquo;s input to the EU&rsquo;s 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy policies and the preparations for the UN&rsquo;s COP21 (the 21<sup>st</sup>Conference of the Parties within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) in Paris in December<b></b>next year.  </p></reply>

Developments in the broadband market over recent years means that there is now a choice of commercial operators offering broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout much of rural Ireland, including the area previously covered by the National Broadband Scheme. Details of commercial services available in each county can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual operators.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Following a competitive tendering process, my Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS. The Scheme offered a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate. EU State Aid approval was granted for a scheme of limited duration and, following a 68 month operational period, the Scheme expired on 25th August 2014.</p><p>  &ldquo;3&rdquo; have confirmed that, following the expiry of the Scheme, they will continue to provide coverage throughout NBS areas on a commercial basis offering consumers the same choice of Broadband plans and tariffs as those offered to consumers outside of the NBS areas. Furthermore, they have also informed my Department of their plans to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS Coverage Areas within the next 3 years. Digiweb, who provided the NBS satellite service on behalf of Three, will continue to offer satellite broadband on a commercial basis. I can therefore assure the Deputy that there is no discontinuation of services in former NBS areas. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas.

Due to the number of people these vehicles can carry, often for short distances, and at reduced speeds for safety reasons their design takes these factors into account while also considering the efficient and swift movement of passengers getting on and off the vehicle.</p></reply>

On average just over 4,400 such licences have been issued each year in the past five hunting seasons. The hunting season for deer is regulated by the Open Seasons Order, which prescribes the periods for hunting different deer species. These periods vary depending on the gender and age of the deer, which reflects the conservation needs of the species concerned. </p><p>  In addition, hunters must comply with a range of requirements contained in the Wildlife Acts, which relate to the type of firearm used, the use of vehicles, hunting at night and the use of lamps.  Persons hunting deer without a deer hunting licence or failing to comply with any of the requirements of the Wildlife Acts would be guilty of an offence. I have no plans at this time to introduce a tagging system in addition to these requirements.</p><p>  My Department does not have data on the number of deer killed illegally each year.  Staff from my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service have, however, carried out an increased number of patrols, including night patrols, where there has been information available in relation to incidents of increased illegal deer killings.  Persons involved in such activity may be subject to prosecution. Both staff from my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have worked diligently on such prosecution cases. </p></reply>
