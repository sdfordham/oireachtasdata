The renewal of Walks Scheme contracts in respect of 14 trails involving almost 900 participants will be finalised by the end of this year. A Pilot Mountain Access Project to establish a formal management structure to enable access to the McGillicuddy Reeks is being developed.</p><p>  The Department has affiliated to the Visitor Safety in the Countryside Group (VSCG) whose objec tive is to develop shared and consistent approaches to creating safe access to the countryside. An information leaflet on Access and Liability has been prepared which provide s clear and concise information regarding the l egal position   in relation to access to private land and occupiers liability. The Department, with the assistance of the State Claims Agency, is developing a National Indemnity Scheme for landowners in rural areas to indemnify them against claims for personal injury or damage to property from recreational users of their land.  A review of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy will begin in September which will consider how best to expand the implementation of the Strategy on a national basis.</p><p>  The Department, in conjunction with the National Trails Advisory Committee (NTAC), the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport and the NRA, is participating in a review of the National Cycle Policy Framework , in particular in the area of recreational cycling. The completion of these and other initiatives is subject to resource constraints, but the Minister secured approximately &euro;600,000 in additional funding for the Rural Recreation budget this year. This funding will assist in maintaining the network of National Waymarked Ways and other priority walking routes of regional or national significance, the establishment of the State Agencies Network and the preparation of a National Plan for the development of State lands and waters for recreation purposes. </p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. </p><p>  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes. In spite of the current challenging circumstances, I expect the final outcome for 2012 to be in the region of 5,000 housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-16a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071600069#WRA01100"><p>Local authorities are the designated authorities with powers to enforce the statutory requirements arising under the Fire Services, Building Control and Planning and Development legislation, all of which is at issue in Priory Hall and in other potential condemned dwellings. The local authorities are also the designated housing authority under the Housing Acts. Neither I nor my Department have a direct role or responsibility in relation to the exercise of these statutory responsibilities.</p><p>  With regard to homelessness, my Department&rsquo;s role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the responsibillities of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and other services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.   </p><p>  Under the 1988 Housing Act a housing authority may consider an individual as homeless if there is no accommodation available that the individual can reasonably occupy and the individual is unable to provide accommodation from their own resources. Where the housing authority has deemed an individual as homeless, the housing authority may, under Section 10 of the Act, provide the individual with such assistance as the authority considers appropriate, including arranging lodgings or contributing to the cost of accommodation.</p><p>  In the case of Priory Hall, I am aware of the significant efforts that have been made by Dublin City Council , with the assistance of my Department, to provide for the needs of residents to date and I understand that the Council will continue to work proactively on behalf of the residents towards achieving the much needed resolution of the issues at Priory Hall.</p><p>  My Department has previously assisted Dublin City Council, in consultation with NAMA, in securing alternative temporary accommodation for many of the residents. In excess of &euro;1.1 million has been contributed to date towards emergency accommodation costs and the costs necessarily incurred by Dublin City Council, in the context of a judgment of the High Court, in providing emergency and temporary accommodation for households evacuated from Priory Hall. Costs incurred accommodating evacuated residents from Priory Hall between October and December 2011 were considered appropriate for recoupment under the homelessness Section 10 funding arrangements and these amounted to &euro;227,368. The remaining costs of &euro;887,000 related to rehousing the social housing tenants, providing alternative accommodation for residents of privately owned apartments and other costs. The overriding priority in Priory Hall, and in any other potential cases, is to ensure the optimum outcome for the households concerned and to facilitate as early as possible a return to their homes. In this respect, it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should. In the case of Priory Hall, I have specifically asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and have asked my Department to continue to liaise closely with the City Council in this regard.</p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the nister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will hav e a considerable   impact on local authority financing.</p><p>  The Local Property Tax is expected to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and, a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user. </p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants. The approach used to allocate the 20% of Local Property Tax revenue available for equalisation will depend on factors such as overall yield and yields at individual local authority level. The priority will be to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. The details will be decide d in the context of Budget 2014.</p><p>  An important purpose of the changes to the funding of the local authorities is to place the local government sector on a more sustainable financial footing. The concept of financial sustainability should not solely be considered in terms of national recovery from our current economic circumstances over the short to medium term; longer term viability and the connection with the citizen are also important elements. The changes which are currently underway are intended to deliver a model of funding which is sustainable in the broadest sense.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-16a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071600069#WRA01800"><p>I have allocated &euro;6.385m for Dormant Accounts Measures in 2013, which includes &euro;2.835m to cover once off costs such as health and safety training, personal protective clothing, necessary equipment and materials, that will be incurred by local authorities providing placements in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s (DSP&rsquo;s) Local Authority Employment Initiative, with the remainder to be used to meet existing contractual commitments.</p><p>  The Disbursement Plan of 2009, put in place by the Dormant Accounts Board, will be replaced later this year by a new disbursement scheme in accordance with the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2012. My Department is consulting with relevant Government Departments and other stakeholders as appropriate in relation to drafting the disbursement scheme. The new scheme will be submitted to Government for approval and, in accordance with the 2012 Act, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It will operate from next year.   </p><p>  The legislation also provides for the preparation of an action plan each year following the making of a scheme. The plan, which will also be subject to consultation, must indicate the programmes or types of projects that may apply for disbursement and the maximum funds available. Different amounts may be specified in the plan in relation to a particular class or classes of programme or project.  Once the plan is adopted, a copy must also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. </p><p>  Government Departments and agencies will still have to source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocations, in the same way as with any other funding programmes. When the monies expended on dormant accounts measures and programmes are reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund, the refund is to the Exchequer rather than to the spending Department. For this reason, dormant accounts expenditure is subject to the same constraints within Departments as any other spending programmes. At a time of severe budgetary pressures, resulting in reduced allocations across Government Department Votes, there is a need to prioritise funding programmes. Expenditure on new dormant accounts measures or programmes could potentially reduce spending on other existing programmes, and would serve to increase Government debt levels. However, this is a matter I am prepared to keep under review, particularly in the context of any improvement to the budgetary situation.</p></reply>

The publication of the policy confirmed the retention of side by side competition in the household waste collection market and also brought much needed policy certainty to the waste sector, particularly in terms of facilitating planning and investment decisions. The policy further sets out a range of proposals significantly to revise the existing regulatory regime to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that waste collected is managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy, that mandated service levels are delivered and that Customer Charters are put in place by all waste collection providers. The work of developing new regulatory structures to give effect to these proposals is underway and my Department is engaging with a range of key stakeholders in relation to the detailed design of the new system. It is my intention that the revised regulatory regime will deliver both enhanced environmental performance and a quality service for consumers. Contractual agreements relating to issues such as the transfer of household waste collection services by a local authority to a private sector waste collector, or remuneration for recyclable waste collected, are matters for the relevant local authority and waste collector concerned.</p></reply>

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution. The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society. In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.</p><p>  Section 34 of the Housing (scellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in this regard. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's Code of Conduct - which was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt - my Department also issued guidance to local authorities in June 2012 in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty. In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment options, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This includes, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The guidelines he approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution. Statistics in relation to the numbers of Shared Ownership mortgages, local authority repossessions, and a range of related issues, can be found on my Department's website, .</p></reply>

Enhanced alignment between local government and local development is intended to improve the targeting of such local development activity. In that context, there will be an opportunity for a stronger, collaborative, focus to be put on support for RAPID areas. In implementing local government reform decisions, my Department will continue to consult, as necessary, with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

It provides the spatial vision and principles to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions through the co-ordinated development of nine gateway cities and towns, and nine hub towns, together with complementary policies to activate the potential for lasting economic development in their hinterlands and wider regions. The NSS serves as a strategic context for spatial planning in Ireland by regional authorities in their regional planning guidelines role, and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in their statutory planning functions. It also seeks to influence investment priorities particularly in transport, housing, water services, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.</p><p>  While the existing NSS remains in place, together with Minister Hogan, I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly for a roadmap to develop a successor strategy that will take account, <i>inter alia</i>  , of our significantly changed economic circumstances and to contribute to sustainable national recovery. A new strategy is expected to be in place in 2015.</p></reply>

Since the introduction of the Energy Efficiency measure in 2009 , funding of almost &euro;100 million has been provided to local authorities for the retrofitting of older and substandard housing stock. Over that period, some 7,760 dwellings have been improved. Over the past two years there was a particular focus on vacant properties and my Department provided around &euro;52.5 million for the refurbishment of some 4,770 houses and apartments. This year&rsquo;s programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed specifically at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building. On 1 March 2013, I announced capital allocations of &euro;10 million to local authorities in respect of energy efficiency retrofitting works for this year.</p><p>  Earlier this month, I announced a new &euro;50 million three-year energy efficiency investment programme for local authority homes. This is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s additional &euro;150 million capital investment in the economy over 2013-2014 aimed at   stimulating growth.   </p><p>This programme will target the 25,000 least energy efficient local authority homes. This will result in warmer homes and lower energy bills for thousands of families and will also create around 1,000 jobs in the sector. I intend to announce capital allocations to local authorities very shortly in order that contracts can be commenced as soon as possible. This programme will operate nationwide and homes in all local authority areas will benefit under this measure. My Department met recently with housing practitioners from all local authorities with the objective of getting work started as quickly as possible. Some &euro;10 million of the &euro;50 million programme is available for spending in 2013.</p></reply>

I recently published a <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i> in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness. When I published the statement I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.   </p><p>  Expenditure on homeless accommodation and related services of approximately &euro;50 million will be funded by my Department and housing authorities in 2013. While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation, it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses in a more focused and strategic way. Arrangements are being put in place to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions in 2013. These arrangements will seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators.</p></reply>

The last meeting of Comhairle na Tuaithe was held in Dublin on 13 June 2013. On average Comhairle na Tuaithe meets 4 to 5 times a year. All of these meetings have been chaired by my Department, and I have not to date attended a meeting. I am satisfied with the level of progress being achieved by Comhairle and the number of initiatives, such as the Pilot Mountain Access Scheme and the proposed National Indemnity Scheme, being progressed on its behalf. </p><p>  With regard to RAPID, the National Monitoring Committee for the RAPID programme met on 6 October 2010. My Department last met with RAPID Chairs and Coordinators at a conference in February 2012 as part of an extensive consultation process in the context of the development of local government reform proposals. As part of my continuing engagement with both the local development and local government sectors, I have met with many of the Chairs and Coordinators at different times and in various fora.  No meeting of the National Monitoring Committee is scheduled at present.  I am keen that a focus is continued on the RAPID areas, through the range of local and community development interventions that are available on an area basis. Enhanced alignment between local government and local development is intended to improve the targeting of such local development spend. In that context, there will be an opportunity for a stronger, collaborative focus to be put on support for RAPID areas. In implementing local government reform decisions, my Department will continue to consult as necessary with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The other authorities involved in the test phase are:</p><p>- South Dublin County Council   </p><p>- Louth County Council   </p><p>- Kilkenny County Council  </p><p>- Waterford City Council</p><p>- Cork County Council</p><p>- Monaghan County Council.</p><p>  A detailed business process design for HAP is currently underway which involves input from all the relevant key stakeholders. Following the completion of the business process design the implementation team will, in conjunction with my Department, develop a plan for the test phase in the above local authorities. It is intended that the test phase of HAP would be carried out in early 2014, subject to the necessary housing and social welfare legislative provisions being in place, including in regard to facilitating deduction of rents at source from welfare payments. Government approval in these regards will be sought in the near future. Once the test phase is complete, the scheme will be extended to other local authorities.</p><p>  In respect of the staff resources, the CCMA, through involvement in both the Project Steering Group and the Project Implementation Team, is providing on-going advice in relation to the resources that will be required by local authorities to implement HAP. This input will continue as the detail of the scheme is developed further this year.</p></reply>

The ban was subsequently extended in several phases and now applies in 27 cities and towns, including all urban areas with a population greater than 15,000 people.</p><p>  The burning of solid fuel for residential heating makes a disproportionate contribution to air pollution, which generally occurs within residential communities where it is most used and where exposure, including to vulnerable groups, can be highest. Products offered for sale in breach of the ban may be of inferior quality, creating more pollution in a person's community and in their ho me   . Research indicated that the ban in Dublin resulted in over 350 fewer annual winter mortality deaths. Additional benefits of the ban were identified through the stimulation of a move away from solid fuels, which generally are less efficient and more polluting, to more efficient and less polluting gas and oil. The additional benefits in reduced fuel costs to consumers were estimated at &euro;184 million per year. </p><p>  Data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates that the effective cost of fuel for home heating using &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal in an open fire is around 15 cent per kilowatt hour (c/kWhr) whereas the price for natural gas using a boiler meeting the Building Regulations is half that at around 7.5c/kWhr.</p><p>  The SEAI data also indicated that while on an energy basis the cost of manufactured smokeless coal is marginally more expensive than &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal (less than 5%), the more even burn of smokeless  coal means that it can be managed so that it lasts longer and may be   less expensive in overall terms. There are a wide range of modern smokeless coals and other products available that are cleaner, easy to burn, and which generally provide more energy per bag and more consistent heat over a longer period with both consumer and health and environmental benefits.</p><p>  The Government has an energy poverty strategy; &lsquo;Warmer Homes &ndash; A Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland&rsquo; which was published by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources towards the end of 2011.   The strategy identified the extent and impact of energy poverty, the existing measures in place and the actions required looking forward.</p><p>  Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to improve the thermal efficiency of the home.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme (BEWH), administered by the SEAI, funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to run.   </p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme. </p><p>  The current Programme, which runs to the end of 2013, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &euro;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure. This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation. The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.   </p><p>  The development of the programme followed a comprehensive review of investment requirements initiated in 2009 involving an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services by each water services authority and taking account of reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans. </p><p>  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs. There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment. In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the <i>Programme for Government</i> provides a series of reforms to be advanced in the water sector, including the establishment of Irish Water. An implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water has been finalised and is available on my   Department's website. As part of this strategy, a specific work-stream is considering the matters arising in the proposed transfer of the responsibility for capital programme delivery from the 34 local authorities to Irish Water. This includes the development of the capital investment programme for 2014 to 2015 and the development of a capital transition plan to manage the orderly transition from current arrangements to the new arrangements to be put in place by Irish Water.</p></reply>

Neither I nor my Department is a party to those proceedings.  Given that the matter is before the courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further other than to continue to urge all concerned to afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task which he is undertaking.</p></reply>

The National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems was adopted and published by the EPA in February 2013.  The Plan provides for a minimum of 1,000 inspections to be carried out by the water services authorities (the 34 county and city councils ) in the 12 month period commencing in July 2013 . Details of the minimum number of inspections for each council area are included in the Plan. The EPA has indicated that it will review the Plan in 2014.   </p><p>  It is not possible at this time to estimate what the failure rate for inspections might be or how much   will be spent on remedial grants. However, based on the number of inspections to be carried out and the grant amounts that I have provided for in the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, I am satisfied that there is adequate provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for this purpose.</p></reply>

The legislation requires the institutions/undertakings to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies.   </p><p>  The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders or policyholders with their funds in credit institutions and insurance undertakings and in this regard, such institutions and undertakings are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies. The fund consists of a reserve account from which reclaims and various expenses are paid and an investment and disbursement account from which investments and disbursements are made.   </p><p>  The transfer of monies to the Dormant Accounts Fund takes place on the basis that the beneficial owners of the monies have a guaranteed right to reclaim their property at any time in the future. The Dormant Accounts fund derives, in the main, from private bank and building society accounts and must be handled and invested prudently having regard to the constitutionally guaranteed right to private property and the confidential nature of the relationship the credit institutions enjoy with their customers. I have no plans at present to amend this legislation.</p></reply>

In addition Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which was established in June 2007 as an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality, works to ensure the delivery of a coordinated response to issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence across Government. Actions to ensure effectiveness and consistency in housing responses for victims of domestic violence are set out in Action 10 of the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014. My Department is developing the necessary guidance to implement this action.   </p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s responsibility is in respect of homelessness which in some cases involves the provision of current funding, under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 , towards the operational costs of refuges for the victims of domestic abuse. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities. M   y Department has no function in regard to, nor is it involved in, decisions on operational matters. </p><p>Persons who are forced to leave their homes due to domestic violence may, however, be placed in accommodation arranged by local authorities without having to be entered on the waiting list.   In the longer term, victims of domestic violence may qualify under Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 for entry on a waiting list for social housing support if, in addition to meeting the normal eligibility criteria, the housing authority considers that their current accommodation is unsuitable, having regard to particular household circumstances or on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.     </p><p>  My Department is keeping the social housing assessment provisions under review and will consider what wider discretion might be given to housing authorities by way of Regulations to address the individually difficult and complex cases which may present to them.   </p><p>  Under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) funding is available to Approved Housing Bodies for the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including victims of domestic violence. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the CAS relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the scheme, including the appraisal of proposals, the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding scheme and the processing of applications for funding, are the responsibility of the relevant housing authority. Approvals are largely based on the prioritisation afforded to individual proposals by the local authority in question.</p></reply>

To provide balance, there will be a reduction in the number of oral questions being submitted to one per member.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>A member must be present in the chamber when his or her question is reached, although they may defer to another member the right to ask a supplementary question</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate on the issue of cabinet confidentiality.</td><td>Cabinet Confidentiality is provided for in Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>We propose an Investigations, Oversight and Petitions Committee of the Oireachtas. It would be a powerful committee, constructed on the lines of the Public Accounts Committee, bi-partisan in structure and chaired by a senior member of the opposition.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Committee would receive parliamentary petitions from individuals and groups in the community seeking the redress of grievances connected with the public services of the State and with the public administration generally. Its functions would be to act as a &quot;clearing house&quot;, directing complaints to those bodies most competent to act on them: the Ombudsman, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Local Government Auditor, the Oireachtas committee that has oversight of the relevant Department, and so on.  </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will refer to the Constitutional Convention, the issue of reducing the Voting Age to 17 and giving citizens the right to vote at Irish embassies in the presidential election.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will ask the Constitutional Convention, which is examining electoral reform, to make recommendations as to how the number of women in politics can be increased.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a new code of practice for the use of the government jet, ensuring transparent and cost effective travel.</td><td>Use of jet much reduced</td></tr><tr><td>We will give committees the power to introduce legislation, while a new 10 Minute Rule will allow backbench TDs to introduce their own Bills. We will also tackle the huge over-use of guillotines to ram through non-emergency legislation</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a package of changes that will bring about a 50 per cent increase in D&aacute;il sitting days. D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will in future meet four days a week. There will be a summer recess of just six weeks and significantly reduced breaks at Christmas and Easter. We will abandon the practice of providing a &#8220;mid-term break&#8221; - a full week off at St Patrick's Day and Hallowe'en.  When the D&aacute;il is not in session the Committees shall agree by roster that a particular Committee shall meet in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We propose to break the Government monopoly on legislation and the stranglehold over the business of the D&aacute;il, by providing that the new Friday sittings will be given over exclusively to committee reports and private members business except where urgent government business must be taken.</td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will enhance the democratic process by involving public representatives at an earlier stage of the legislative process, particularly before Bills are published. We will amend cabinet procedure instructions so as to allow government to publish the general scheme of a Bill so that Oireachtas Committees can debate and hold hearings at an early stage.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>While recognising that there may be exceptional circumstances in which debate may need to be concluded by a given deadline, we will restrict the use of guillotine motions and other procedural devices that prevent Bills from being fully debated, so that guillotining is not a matter of routine as it has become at present, particularly at the end of a session. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will also deal with the related problem of legislation being shunted through at high speed and will ensure that D&aacute;il standing orders provide a minimum of two weeks between each stage of a Bill, except in exceptional circumstances.</td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>In order to enhance the role of the legislative committees, we will organise a committee week every fourth sitting week. The D&aacute;il plenary will sit only for questions, including Leaders' Questions and the order of business and the remainder of the day will be taken up in committee.</td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish a petition system to the D&aacute;il, similar to that operating in the European Parliament, to be managed by a specific D&aacute;il committee that will investigate and report on petitions which raise issues warranting attention.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will enhance the parliamentary relationship with the European Parliament in conjunction with Ireland's MEPs. These arrangements will include regular attendance by MEPs at relevant D&aacute;il committees. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will significantly revamp the adjournment debate format. It will be renamed the topical issue debate. There will be a minimum of 5 topical issues. These will be taken in the middle of the day and there will be provision for questions at the end. A Minister or Minister of State from the relevant Department will be present and there will be an end to the practice of one junior Minister reading out scripts on behalf of a number of Departments about a range of issues of which he or she knows nothing.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The standing orders on urgent issues are used regularly to attempt to raise issues that are not urgent and such requests are almost invariably refused. We will make the D&aacute;il rules for raising urgent issues more meaningful by requiring a minimum number of signatories for such a request. In future, Standing Order 32 requests will not be read out.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Taoiseach will be obliged to brief the Oireachtas prior to attending European Council meetings and to engage with the Oireachtas in debate on EU issues of national significance and concern.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will devote a full week each year to debating major EU issues of concern to Ireland such as the Draft Annual Work Programme, Green and White Papers and proposals for EU budget co-ordination.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will be linked up with the Irish offices of the European Commission and the European Parliament in communicating Europe to the Irish people. Outreach programmes, meetings and competitions particularly in schools will be organised and TDs and Senators invited to participate.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Under the Lisbon Treaty provisions the Oireachtas is entitled to receive all documents produced by the EU Commission at the same time as the EU institutions and the Irish Government receive them. We will ensure all EU documents are forwarded to the Oireachtas through the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach. They will transmit them to the Oireachtas library and the relevant Committees. Every TD and Senator will be informed of the documents as they arrive, so that they can engage in EU matters that concern or interest them.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We propose that Oireachtas Committees will play the major role in scrutinising the EU in the coming years.  Greater emphasis will be placed on deepening the involvement in EU matters of the Oireachtas committees that shadow the work of each Government Department.

However the Department recognises that passport applicants may on occasion require a faster turnaround service.  Priority at public counters in Dublin and Cork is given to those travelling at short notice where the fastest turnaround time for these applications is three working days.  Appointments for Molesworth St can be made at www.passportappointments.ie  Additionally an emergency same day service is also provided for those whose travel plans are necessitated by an emergency such as the death or illness of a family member.  Applicants in such situations should contact the Molesworth Street or Cork public offices or the out of hours duty officer service, where, on provision of proofs of the emergency situation as detailed above, a passport will issue. The Passport Service endeavours to provide all citizens with the best possible service consistent with resource constraints.  The Passport Express arrangement, which involves an element of pre-checking, is the most efficient means of achieving this. Dealing with individual applications on an exceptional basis inevitably involves a diversion of resources which results in a delay in the processing of other applications.  The facility whereby applications for passports could to be submitted through members of the Oireachtas and accorded priority treatment was discontinued in 2010 and I have no plans for its reintroduction  .</p></reply>

This is a very positive development that takes us another step closer towards addressing the problems faced by undocumented Irish emigrants in the US and will allow them to emerge from the shadows. I strongly welcome the provisions in the Bill passed by the Senate to address the concerns of our undocumented and the specific E3 provisions for Ireland that provide extensive legal pathway for future migration flows between Ireland and the US. </p><p>  I am particularly pleased that the Bill includes provisions that will allow for continuation of the summer J1 visa programme. Earlier drafts of the bill had threatened the future viability of the programme. I raised these concerns directly with Senator Patrick Leahy, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am pleased that the Bill as passed by the Senate no longer classifies J1 summer participants as foreign workers, which would have imposed significant additional requirements on them and their potential employers. Earlier texts had also proposed a further fee of $500 to be paid by the sponsoring organisations; the Bill as passed introduces a fee of $100, and the conditions surrounding payment of this fee would allow for it to be paid by either the sponsoring organisation or the participant.</p><p>  I pay tribute to hard work and persistence of Senators Leahy, Schumer, McCain and other members of the US Senate bipartisan group who brought forward the original proposals. I also welcome the considerable bipartisan support that has emerged in support of the Senate bill and hope that this bodes well for its further prospects. </p><p>  The prospects for a successful outcome remain uncertain as the focus now moves to the House of Representatives. To reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s interest in the issue, I visited Washington DC last week where I met with a range of Senators and Congressmen and Congresswomen from both parties.  I met with a range of the most significant Congressional leaders on immigration issues from both sides of the US political divide, including Chairman Peter King (R-New York) and Cong. Richard Neal (D-Massachusetts) of the Friends of Ireland Congressional Group; Cong. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), Chair of House Budgetary Committee; Cong. Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), Chair of House Judiciary Committee and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D- Calif) and Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator John McCain among others.  I also raised immigration reform at senior official level in the White House.  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my appreciation for the active support we continue to receive from a number of Irish community organisations, some of whom I met during my Washington visit.   In pressing to secure a solution for the undocumented, we continue to work closely with them. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Emigrant Support Programme, has provided funding to a number of organisations active in this area.</p><p>  We will closely follow developments over the coming weeks, and will coordinate closely with our friends in Congress, the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Irish community groups in the US.</p></reply>

The review examined the progress made by the aid programme over the past 6 years and reassessed the changing context, in Ireland and overseas, in which we operate. A comprehensive public consultation process reached over 1000 people directly, through public meetings throughout the country and overseas. It involved meetings with NGOs, members of the Oireachtas, the Private Sector, Diaspora groups and other stakeholders. It also encouraged interested parties to submit written submissions. Over 160 of these were received and are now available on the Irish Aid website. The review process has been widely recognised as good practice in participatory policy making. </p><p>  One World, One Future sets out the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in international development over the coming years &ndash; a framework which will help bring greater coherence to our work, and enable us to better plan for and measure more comprehensively the results which our development efforts are achieving. </p><p>  It defines our vision of a sustainable and just world where people are empowered to overcome poverty and hunger and fully realise their rights and potential. It identifies three clear goals: (1) reduced hunger and stronger resilience; (2) sustainable development, inclusive economic growth; and (3) better governance, human rights and accountability.</p><p>  It also sets out 6 priority areas for action around which we will plan and manage our resources: a) Global Hunger b) Countries that are fragile c) Climate Change and Development, d) Trade and Economic Growth, e) Essential Services, f) Human Rights and Accountability.</p><p>  Given our leading role on hunger, it is perhaps not surprising that this framework places achieving Food and Nutrition Security centre stage. But, we are also signalling an evolution in our approach by increasing our focus on responding to situations of fragility, giving even more attention to human rights, ensuring that greater emphasis is placed on inclusive and equitable economic growth and promoting more rounded relationships with our Key Partner Countries by bringing economic and political relations further into the dialogue.</p><p>  One World, One Future, has been very positively received by Irish Aid partners.

I am advised that these persons have been charged subsequently with criminal offences by the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland. Under the Hillsborough Agreement, of which the Irish Government is a co-guarantor, responsibility for policing in Northern Ireland is now a devolved matter. The Chief Constable is accountable to the Northern Ireland Policing Board which has cross community representation.   As part of the Good Friday Agreement, a Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland was established to provide independent and impartial investigation of the new police service. Complaints of alleged misconduct by the PSNI can be made to the Police Ombudsman, who in turn is accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly, through the Minister for Justice.</p><p>  As is the case in this jurisdiction, the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland is independent in the exercise of its functions.

I very much regret the loss of lives, estimated at around 100 persons, and the many casualties since the onset of the current crisis.   Incidents such as the heavy loss of life outside the Republican Guard HQ in Cairo on 7 July must be thoroughly and impartially investigated.  It is not correct that Ireland, the EU and UN have stayed silent about this crisis.   In my own public comments, I have remarked that no one who truly holds to democratic values can view with equanimity what was, to all intents and purposes, a military takeover.  I  continue to believe that, as a matter of principle, a military intervention of this kind which sets aside a country&rsquo;s established constitutional and democratic order cannot be condoned.   EU High Representative Ashton issued a declaration on 14 July, on behalf of the 28 member States, which made clear the EU&rsquo;s deep concern at recent developments in Egypt.  This declaration stated that the military must accept and respect the constitutional authority of the civilian power as a basic principle of democratic governance and that it was of the utmost importance that Egypt should returns rapidly to a legitimate government and democratic structures.  I note that UN Secretary General Ban has also expressed deep concern about events in Egypt following the 3 July suspension of the Constitution and the removal from office of President Morsi and his government.</p><p>  The immediate priority is for all political actors in Egypt to show restraint, to refrain from any recourse to violence and to dedicate themselves urgently to the task of charting a political way forward which must be respectful of the aspirations and orientations of the entire population.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners believe that the only solution to the situation we are facing in Egypt is to promote a fully inclusive process of political dialogue and reconciliation aimed at the swiftest possible restoration of democratic rule and civilian-led Government, following free and fair legislative and Presidential elections. The interim President, Mr. Al-Mansour, has proposed a road-map for the restoration of the constitution and of normal democratic government, which now needs to be discussed and agreed by all parties in Egypt.  It is also essential for all actors and those now in positions of responsibility in Egypt to commit to, and to ensure, the full protection of basic human rights, fundamental freedoms and rule of law. </p><p>  The interim Presidency and all those in positions of influence must reach out to all political forces, without exception, and must ensure all strands of Egyptian society can  contribute to the building of a genuine democracy and improved economic circumstances.  Conciliatory moves to defuse the current crisis, including the release of those detained for political reasons, are also essential. </p><p>  As I have stated previously, Egypt and its people are experiencing a difficult transition to democracy.  Ireland and its EU partners are fully committed to providing whatever support we can to assist the Egyptian people along this path.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions. We aim to ensure that Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  However, they have also participated in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.</p><p>So far in 2013, Ireland has participated in election observation missions in Jordan, Armenia, Kenya, Paraguay, Pakistan, Albania and Mongolia.  The Department decides on a case by case basis which election observation missions Ireland should participate in.  Currently, there are no outstanding invitations from international bodies for Irish participation in election observation missions, although notifications are expected from both the EU and the OSCE over the coming months.</p><p>When it is decided to nominate observers to a particular mission, the Department seeks expressions of interest from all observers on the election roster.  A list of suitably qualified observers is drawn up, taking into account the specific criteria for the mission, including local or regional experience, and language proficiency.  Gender balance and length of time since serving on a mission are also key factors in the selection process.  Following completion of the internal selection process, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval.  </p><p>In the case of European Union election observation missions, the final selection of observers from the list of approved nominees submitted by the Department rests with the European Commission.  In the case of OSCE election observation missions, all the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected.</p><p>I am confident that the establishment this year of the new election observation roster, comprising 200 highly qualified individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience, will ensure that Ireland can consistently nominate the best qualified people for election monitoring missions.  At this point, I do not envisage changes to the procedure by which members of the new roster will be nominated for missions.</p></reply>

Ireland joined the Bank in 2006, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Asia Strategy to increase Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in Asia.    Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;paid-in&rsquo; subscription on joining the Bank in 2006 was &euro;8.4 million.  Ireland also contributed &euro;1.6 million to two trust funds of the Bank, the Gender and Development Cooperation Trust Fund and the Governance Cooperation Trust Fund.  All of this funding was provided from non-voted Central Fund expenditure, under the authority of the Minister for Finance.   In 2011, the Minister for Finance decided that Ireland would contribute to the Bank&rsquo;s Capital Increase, which involves further contributions of &euro;8 million over ten years.  In addition, since joining the Asian Development Bank, Ireland has contributed &euro;51million from Central Fund expenditure to the Asian Development Fund which provides concessional loans and grants to the poorest countries in Asia. In 2012, Ireland, through the Department of Finance, pledged to contribute &euro;20 million to the tenth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund, to be provided over nine years.  The first instalment was provided to the Fund this month.  All these contributions are counted as part of Ireland&rsquo;s overall Official Development Assistance.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the Asian Development Bank is managed by the Department of Finance.  The Bank&rsquo;s operation is reviewed at its annual meeting, at which Ireland is represented by officials of the Department of Finance.  There is ongoing review of the work of the Bank by its Internal Evaluation Department, which independently and systematically evaluates Bank policies, strategies and operations. This process is important in providing feedback on the effectiveness of its operations and the achievement of development outcomes.  The most recent Annual Evaluation Review, for 2013, is available on the Bank&rsquo;s website, at www.adb.org/site/evaluation   .</p><p>  The Asian Development Bank is also regularly reviewed by the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN), of which Ireland is one of seventeen members.  MOPAN assesses the organisational effectiveness of the major multilateral organisations which its members fund. The most recent MOPAN review of the Bank&rsquo;s work, in 2011, noted that it is implementing reforms to improve its organisational effectiveness, especially in relation to making transparent and predictable aid allocation decisions, presenting information on performance and monitoring external results.  The Government&rsquo;s new Policy for International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, confirms the strong focus of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme on some of the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  In line with this commitment, we will explore any potential benefits of membership of the African Development Bank, particularly in the context of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s Africa Strategy, and in consultation with the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

Other courses and training programmes regularly delivered include a comprehensive pre-posting training programme with modules on trade promotion, economic themes, provision of consular services, personal safety, public diplomacy and human rights.  Training is also routinely provided for staff in key areas such as management development, performance management, leadership, positive working environment, macro-economics, communication skills, social media and customer service.

At the meeting, discussions covered a wide range of financial, economic and EU matters including the economic challenges faced in both jurisdictions, the work being undertaken to address the global economic crisis, bank restructuring and NAMA. The success of Ireland's Presidency of the EU and progress made on key issues of mutual interest North and South was acknowledged, as was the cooperation between our administrations during our Presidency term, which had seen Northern Ireland Executive Ministers involved in Presidency-related events and our Ministers briefing their Executive counterparts on Presidency-related issues at NSMC meetings.   </p><p>  There was particular welcome for the provision of &euro;150 million in the EU's Multi-annual Financial Framework towards a new PEACE programme, the achievements in regard to Common Agriculture Policy Reform and Common Fisheries Policies and the impact of transnational EU programmes.</p><p>  We thanked the Executive for the provision of meeting facilities and staff by the Northern Ireland Executive Office in Brussels and for the provision of seconded staff from the Northern Ireland Civil Service.  </p><p>  The Plenary also saw a discussion on the levels of youth unemployment in both jurisdictions and the action being taken to tackle this issue.  Ministers considered the opportunities for collaboration to address this important matter including through the EU's new Youth Guarantee and to work with relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of the Youth Guarantee.  </p><p>  We welcomed the success of the G8 Summit which had acted as a showcase worldwide and discussed how its positive impact and the potential of major tourism events including 'The Gathering' and Derry UK City of Culture 2013 can be maximised.</p><p>  There was also a discussion on the opportunities for both administrations to cooperate in developing trade opportunities in, and building business links with developing markets such as China, Brazil and India.  The role of the Irish Embassy network in supporting the Northern Ireland Executive during trade visits was acknowledged. </p><p>In addition, there was agreement to cooperate on the new <i>Building a Prosperous and United Community</i> economic package for Northern Ireland which followed the <i>Together: Building a United Community </i>  strategy. </p><p>  Ministers noted the commencement of the consultation with key stakeholders in the North West on the future development of the North West Gateway Initiative and that a report on the outcome of this exercise will be brought to a future NSMC Institutional meeting.  </p><p>  With regard to the St Andrews Agreement Review we noted that Term of Reference One of the Review is now largely complete; that senior officials from both administrations have met and initiated a work programme to take forward Terms of Reference Two and Three; on expanding the areas of North South cooperation, and that they will conclude their work and present a report with proposals to the next NSMC Institutional meeting in the autumn.</p><p>The plenary was characterised by excellent exchanges with our Northern colleagues on topics of mutual interest   and we will continue to work with them to identify additional opportunities where there is scope for further North South economic cooperation. </p></reply>

These visits are aimed to broaden the Consulate&rsquo;s economic networks and include outreach to key local leaders, networking with the local Irish communities, and briefings for the media on the Government&rsquo;s work to restore Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  In connecting with the Irish community in West Virginia, which is very well-established and includes a sizeable Scots-Irish element, every opportunity was taken to promote The Gathering. The visit of the Deputy Consul General to West Virginia, from 8th to 11th July included each of these elements.  The Deputy Consul General paid a courtesy call on the Governor of West Virginia, Earl Ray Tomblin, which provided an opportunity to update the Governor on the economic situation in Ireland and also to explore possible areas of collaboration.  The Governor has visited Ireland on a number of occasions, most recently in 2009 when he visited Belfast, Dublin and a number of other locations.  The Governor expressed interest in visiting Ireland again on a future occasion with a view to enhancing the business links, which include investments in West Virginia by a number of Irish companies.     The Deputy Consul General also visited the principal institutions of higher learning in West Virginia to encourage collaboration with Ireland, both in terms of students travelling to Ireland for their overseas study and in the area of research and development.  His visit provided him with an opportunity to follow-up on the recent visit to Ireland by a group of fifty business students of the University of Charleston, who had spent time in Dublin and Limerick where they connected with a number of their university counterparts.  He also met with the leadership of the leading educational institution in the state, West Virginia University, which has a number of collaborative agreements with Irish counterparts and are keen to develop these further.  The West Virginia University is in the midst of substantial capital development and has already been working to build on what it views as many similarities with the Irish university sector and areas of potential collaboration.  Similarly, the Wheeling Jesuit University is in development phase and is interested in seeking closer international collaboration. There is potential to develop research collaboration given that the University is host to the National Technology Transfer Centre.  </p><p>  The Deputy Consul General met with members of the Irish community in Charleston and Wheeling, mainly Irish by heritage as their ancestors came to West Virginia in the post-Famine period.  He also met with some of the Irish-born religious who have played a role in the development of the education and health sectors in West Virginia. Their contribution is widely acknowledged by West Virginians of all faiths.</p><p>  In his outreach to the media in West Virginia, the Deputy Consul General met with the editors of the main business news publications, and briefed them on the economic recovery in Ireland and highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s attractions as a location for West Virginia&rsquo;s companies to access the European Union market.</p></reply>

The ruling of the Superior Appeal Court was that the installation of the monument was illegal as the University had never sought the relevant urban planning permission.  The original decision to locate the monument at the University was, I understand, inspired by the fact that some of the heaviest fighting in 1936 between Nationalist and Republican forces in Madrid took place in the grounds of that University. I am aware that there are other existing monuments to the International Brigades in Spain, including in the Madrid region in the area around the Jarama river, south of the city, where one of the most important battles took place.     I understand that the ruling of the Appeal Court is final and that there is no further judicial appeal.  While, like many other people in this country I personally regret the decision, it is not possible for the Irish government to intervene in an internal matter which arises from a judicial ruling relating to the application of Spain&rsquo;s planning laws.  </p></reply>

In most such cases, the second passport is required for business purposes and in such cases applicants are required to include a letter from their employer detailing the circumstances of their case and to provide sample travel plans which show travel into the countries concerned.  The Passport Service does not issue second concurrent passports for once off or infrequent holiday travel to a destination where such issues arise.  In such cases, passport holders are advised to renew their passport before travelling to a country where they might be refused entry.    If on the other hand a passport holder wishes to renew their passport before the 10 years validity has expired they are only required to complete the standard application form and submit their current passport. </p></reply>

This declaration was issued with the support of Member States, including Ireland.  The declaration conveyed our concern at the restrictions on expressions of Tibetan identity, which appear to be giving rise to a surge of discontent in the region.  While respecting China&rsquo;s territorial integrity, the EU called upon the Chinese authorities to address the deep-rooted causes of the frustration of the Tibetan people to ensure that their civil, political, economic and social and cultural rights are respected, including their right to enjoy their own culture, to practise their own religion and to use their own language.  This declaration also called on Tibetan community and religious leaders to use their influence to help stop this tragic loss of life.  </p><p>  Ireland together with our EU partners believes that constructive dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is the best way to address differences and tensions in Tibet and to reach a solution that respects Tibetan culture, language, religion and identity.  It is important for the long-term peace and stability of the region that the two sides come to an agreement on the future of Tibet.  To this end, we continue to encourage a resumption of meaningful dialogue.  </p><p>  The promotion of human rights is an important dimension of European foreign policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union. Constructive dialogue remains the EU&rsquo;s preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation in China.  Human rights are discussed as part of regular political dialogue as well as during specific human rights dialogues, the most recent of which took place on 25 June.  That Dialogue allowed the two sides to have a detailed exchange of views on a wide range of human rights issues.  It provided an opportunity for the EU to express concerns regarding the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p>  Bilaterally, Ireland continues to convey its concerns about the situation in Tibet directly to the Chinese authorities through contacts in both Dublin and Beijing.</p></reply>

There is at present no system for the issue of CD vehicle plates to members of the diplomatic corps.  The privileges and immunities of accredited members of diplomatic missions are governed by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts 1967, which in turn give effect in Irish law to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961. The issue of CD vehicle plates is not provided for in the Vienna Convention, and their presence on a vehicle is not determinative of an entitlement to privileges and immunities, but rather is typically a visual indication that a vehicle is being used by a member of a diplomatic mission. Accordingly, the fact that there is currently no system for the issue of CD vehicle plates does not affect in any way the privileges and immunities to which the staff of a diplomatic mission are entitled.  Upon being notified to my Department in accordance with Article 10 of the Vienna Convention, the members of diplomatic missions are issued with identity cards which may be produced to assist members of An Garda S&iacute;ochana to verify their status under the Convention. </p></reply>

Myanmar/Burma is continuing to undergo a process of long-awaited transformation. Ireland and our EU partners recognise that significant progress has been made, but that complex challenges remain.  We continue to urge the Government of Myanmar/Burma to address these challenges, particularly issues in regards to the Rohingya minority, through the relevant bilateral and multilateral channels.  At the 22<sup>nd</sup>  session of UN Human Rights Council in March, Ireland supported an EU-led resolution which highlighted a number of human rights issues in Myanmar/Burma requiring action, including extending the mandate of the special rapporteur, and invited the Government to set a timetable for the opening of an OHCHR country office.</p><p>  At the 23<sup>rd</sup>   session of the UN Human Rights Council in May/June, Ireland and our fellow council members adopted a Presidential Statement regarding the Situation for Muslims in Myanmar/Burma.

I understand that this is an area of social and economic under-development, where the presence of illegal armed groups and a high level of militarisation also contribute to tensions. Recent protests in this area have, most regrettably, resulted in clashes between protestors and Colombia&rsquo;s security forces and these have led to injuries and to the tragic loss of four lives. At my request, officials have raised these events with the Colombian authorities and are also in touch with the European External Action Service.   The challenging socio-economic conditions faced by local communities in this region are serious and need attention.  Progress on these issues can best be made in a context of peace and trust.  I understand that while there has been some dialogue on issues of concern, tensions remain high.  In my view, it is important that citizens who engage peacefully in the political and social developments of their society can do so without fear of risks to their personal security. It is also, of course, important that all parties operate within the rule of law.  I urge all involved to address issues of insecurity so as to foster conditions for peace and sustainable development.</p><p>Together with our partners in the EU, Ireland will continue to support activities in Colombia that promote peace, truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation.</p></reply>

Human rights issues, including the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, are issues discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral and multilateral meetings.  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 25 June 2013 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment.   At this meeting, the EU also asked about measures taken so far by China to ratify the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998 in view of China&rsquo;s undertaking made during the 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to ratify the Covenant at an early date. </p><p>  In February 2013, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.

Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and, therefore, cohabiting couples cannot file joint assessment tax returns or share their tax credits and tax bands in the same manner as married couples.  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. </p><p>  However, a cohabiting couple where both partners are working get, in total, the same tax credits as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership (i.e. &euro;3,300).  In addition, the same amount of income is subject to tax at the 20% rate (i.e. &euro;32,800 each).  This equates to the &euro;65,600 threshold in the case of a married couple or couple in a civil partnership.</p><p>  If both cohabitants earn in excess of the standard rate band (i.e. &euro;32,800), then they both pay tax at 41% on any income in excess of &euro;32,800.  Married couples or couples in a civil partnership where both individuals work get the same treatment.</p><p>  The difference between the two groups in relation to income tax is the ability of married couples or civil partners to transfer certain tax credits such as the personal/married credits and part of the tax bands, i.e. the tax band of &euro;65,600 available to married couples or couples in a civil partnership with two incomes in 2013 is transferable between spouses up to a maximum of &euro;41,800.  This is of benefit where one of the individuals earns less than the 20% tax threshold of &euro;32,800 or where one of the individuals has no income. </p><p>  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership. Therefore, there is no reason why they ought to be accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status which is recognised in law.  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. </p></reply>

This legislation provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  Health care is defined for the purposes of that legislation as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and includes care received by a woman in respect of pregnancy.  Health care does not include routine ophthalmic or dental treatment.</p><p>  The section provides that tax relief must be either for the costs of the services of a practitioner, defined as a person registered on the register established under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner, which includes &ldquo;physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.  Eligibility for tax relief is limited to expenses relating to treatment considered necessary and appropriate by a qualified practitioner.</p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 consolidated all previous legislation pertaining to relief for health expenses, in particular section 12 of Finance Act 1967 which introduced the relief in the first instance.  That section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.</p><p>  This issue was raised during the debates in the Seanad on Finance Bill 2013, during which I agreed to re-examine the matter during the course of this year.</p><p>  My officials are currently in the process of examining the issue and have requested additional information from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists to assist them in the examination of the matter. To date, the additional information sought has not been provided. </p><p>  Furthermore, I am advised that the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists recently met with the Minister for Health, Dr. James Reilly T.D., on this issue and I am currently awaiting his views on the issue. </p><p>  When the analysis is completed and the findings are presented to me, I will make any necessary decisions in the context of Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013. </p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.  Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship. Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>  An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &#8220;<i>designated person</i>&#8221; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &#8220;<i>financial institution</i>  &#8221;. In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.</p><p>  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.</p><p>  In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

The contribution formula for the EU budget is comprised of Traditional Own Resources &ndash; principally customs duties collected by member States on behalf of the EU; a VAT based payment; a residual balancing component paid according to each member State&rsquo;s share of EU Gross National Income (GNI) and a payment towards a number of rebates for certain member States, also linked to GNI   As of July 1, Ireland has contributed a total of &euro;1,030 million to the European Union budget during 2013. This comprises &euro;96 million in respect of Traditional Own Resources, &euro;140 million in VAT related contributions, &euro;738 million in respect of GNI payments and &euro;56 million in respect of rebates. We are notified on a monthly basis by the European Commission for a call-up of funds under these various headings. </p><p>  The first preliminary outturn for 2013 Irish GNI is likely to be released by the CSO in March 2014. As is the norm, this will be the first point when data for Ireland&rsquo;s GNI for 2013 will be available and is provisional as more detailed annual estimates will not be available until June 2014. I understand that the CSO does not intend to produce a quarterly series showing the impact of redomiciled companies on GNI (owing to the volatility around dividend payments by these companies to their shareholders). It is anticipated that the annual impact of the redomiciled companies on GNI will be available in June 2014. In advance of this information, it is not possible to estimate the likely impact from redomiciled companies on the 2013 Irish contribution to the EU budget.</p></reply>

The audited accounts of Anglo Irish Bank for the year ended 30 September 2008 reported that the bank was not insolvent at that time. However, it is now clear that the full extent of the evolving problems in global financial crisis or the property market were not envisaged in any assessment of the bank at that time. In the course of 2009/2010 the extent of the problems became clear and the level of impairments on assets increased substantially necessitating further injections of capital to sustain the capital position of the bank. In terms of the liquidity issues being encountered by the Bank in 2008, the Deputy will be aware that a State guarantee was put in place on 29 Sept 2008 which included Anglo Irish Bank.</p></reply>

In line with this, NAMA Board guidelines require that sales agents prepare a final report and recommendation, which includes, inter alia, confirmation that the sales agent has reviewed the purchaser&rsquo;s declaration relating to connected party sales and a statement disclosing any commercial relationship between the agent, debtor, purchaser or purchaser&rsquo;s ultimate beneficial owners in the past five years and how any actual or perceived conflict of interest was managed during the sales process.  I am further advised that AIB ensures that an appropriate market value is achieved for each asset sale.  AIB uses various processes to achieve this on a case by case basis as well as having a robust and externally validated property valuation policy and a Conflicts of Interest policy.  Other controls range from external valuations, the use of auctions, the utilisation of an auctioneer unconnected to the borrower and solicitor confirmation that the transaction is at arm&rsquo;s length.  The exact method used depends very much on the circumstances of each case.</p><p>  PTSB&rsquo;s policy is that offers on all property sales are considered on a case by case basis and against two independent valuations.</p></reply>

In settlement of this non-payment, AIB shares were issued to the NPRFC as follows:  <b>Year of Settlement No of Shares Issued</b>: 2010 - 198,089,847; 2011 - 1,247,273,565; 2012 - 3,623,969,972; 2013 - 4,144,055,254.</p><p>  The process for determining the number of shares paid was determined in line with the 2009 Preference Share Subscription Agreement.</p><p>  2009 Preference Shares do not have a repayment date and were not due for repayment in 2013.  The coupon on the 2009 Preference Shares was paid in shares in May of 2013 as per AIB's stock exchange announcement, a link to which is provided as follows:<i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i><i><font color="#0000FF">_d_press_releases&amp;amp;cid=1367253399001&amp;amp;c=AIB_Press_Releas&amp;amp;channel=IRHP&amp;amp;position=notfirst</font></i></p><p>  I have also been informed by AIB that with regards to the 2009 Preference Share Agreement AIB has never defaulted on the dividend payment owed on these preference shares. As per the terms of the agreement the dividend can be paid in either cash or shares.</p><p>  The AIB Preference Shares were issued to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission (NPRFC) on 13 May 2009.  Under the terms of the Preference Shares, a non-cumulative discretionary cash dividend at 8 per cent per annum may be paid on the anniversary of the issue of those shares if the Board of Directors of AIB decides to pay the dividend.  It was necessary for the cash dividend to be discretionary in order to comply with the regulatory capital requirements in place at the time of the issue of the Preference Shares.  However, if the discretionary cash dividend is not paid, AIB must issue bonus AIB ordinary shares to the NPRFC equal in value to the cash dividend.  As the bonus AIB ordinary shares are issued to the NPRFC under the terms of the 2009 Preference Shares, no additional direction or authorisation from the Minister for Finance is required for the issue of such shares.</p><p>  The value of the AIB shares held by the NPRF at 31 March 2013 and pending completion of an independent valuation review, comprised:- Ordinary shares, provisionally valued at &euro;0.0079 per share;- Preference shares, provisionally valued at end 2012 valuations of 66% of par </p><p>  The final year end valuation will be reflected in the Fund's audited financial statements for 2012 which will be published in July 2013.</p></reply>

In relation to the Board packs specifically these were provided to the Department on a monthly basis since August 2011. Officials from the Department of Finance monitored this information extensively and relied on it as part of their on-going engagement with the bank. </p><p>  The Board papers would have contained many references to the efforts being made by the bank in dealing with the legacy issues relating to Anglo Irish Bank and INBS and also the on-going compliance with all investigations into the bank.  These would have included the various documentation and other requests received by the ODCE, GBFI, CARB etc. in the context of their investigations.  As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No.220 on 2nd of July last, IBRC provided the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation audio recordings in respect of 18 employees of the bank whose lines were recorded in 2010.</p><p>  Neither I nor my Department have any role in the on-going Garda or other regulatory investigations into Anglo Irish Bank or any other Irish Bank.  It would be completely inappropriate for the Department of Finance to act outside of its legal powers and interfere with any investigation that could compromise potential future criminal or civil investigations by the bodies responsible under statute. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware all debts owing to IBRC remain due and enforceable following the liquidation of the bank, in that context I am advised that the minutes of the board meetings of IBRC are not a matter of public record as they contain a large amount of material which could be considered legally privileged or commercially sensitive even following the liquidation of the bank.</p><p>  However this documentation will obviously be available to any banking inquiry which may be set in the future.  The Government is determined to ensure the public is informed about what happened in Irish Banks and has published the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill which, once enacted, will provide the legal framework for such a banking inquiry to be held within the current constitutional parameters.</p></reply>

They serve on many Bank committees as well as the Boards themselves and their breath of experience brings a deeper and wider knowledge base and understanding to all the Banks which they serve.  Our stated policy is get the Banks fully functioning and run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as an asset to the State.  The public interest directors have an essential role to play in assisting our aims.</p><p>  Of course, the legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions whether under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 or otherwise is subject to the requirements of company law in relation to the discharge of their responsibilities as a company director.  As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself.  These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities.  To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act.  This recognises the fundamental role that all public interest directors serve.</p></reply>

To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in Section 4 of the CISA Act. </p><p>  Section 4 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 states:  4. The purposes of this Act are&mdash;(a) to address the serious and continuing disruption to the economy and the financial system and the continuing serious threat to the stability of certain credit institutions in the State and the financial system generally,-(b) to implement the reorganisation of credit institutions in the State to achieve the financial stabilisation of those credit institutions and their restructuring (consistently with the state aid rules of the European Union) in the context of the National Recovery Plan 2011 - 2014 and the European Union/International Monetary Fund Programme of Financial Support for Ireland,-(c) to continue the process of reorganisation, preservation and restoration of the financial position of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited begun with the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009,-(d) to continue the process of preservation and restoration of the financial position of building societies through the issue of special investment shares under section 18 (1A) of the Building Societies Act 1989,-(e) to protect the interests of depositors in credit institutions,-(f) to address the compelling need&mdash;(i) to facilitate the availability of credit in the economy of the State, (ii) to protect the State&rsquo;s interest in respect of the guarantees given by the State under the Act of 2008 and to support the steps taken by the Government in that regard,(iii) to protect the interests of taxpayers,(iv) to restore confidence in the banking sector and to underpin Government support measures in relation to that sector, and (v) to align the activities of the relevant institutions and the duties and responsibilities of their officers and employees with the public interest and the other purposes of this Act,- (g) to preserve and restore the financial position of a relevant institution, and- (h) to empower the Court to impose reorganisation measures through orders made in reliance on the CIWUD Directive.</p><p>  I am satisfied that with twenty years&rsquo; experience in politics, four Ministerial portfolios and three and a half years as Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dukes had reasonable experience to assess what was in the public interest.</p></reply>

They serve on many Bank committees as well as the Boards themselves and their breath of experience brings a deeper and wider knowledge base and understanding to all the Banks which they serve.  Our stated policy is to get the Banks fully functioning and run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as an asset to the State.  The public interest directors have an essential role to play in assisting our aims.</p><p>  Of course, the legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions whether under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 or otherwise is subject to the requirements of company law in relation to the discharge of their responsibilities as a company director.  As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself.  These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities.  To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act.  This recognises the fundamental role that all public interest directors serve.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware this Government has not appointed any public interest directors to the boards of the Banks since taking office.  I understand that in addition to their other experiences, the public interest directors currently on the boards of the covered institutions were nominated by my predecessor on the basis of the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of their civic mindedness and sense of where the public interest lies to inform their view of what was in the institution&rsquo;s interest.  I am advised that the Department of Finance held generic briefing sessions on the CIFS scheme in general and on the fiduciary duties of non-executive directors for individuals on the panel from which the covered institutions appointed public interest directors but that there was no job description or scope of work set out for them as this was determined under company law.  In addition, for this reason public interest directors did not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.</p><p>  The public interest directors serve at Ministerial request and it is the prerogative of the Government to request them to step down or be replaced. </p><p>  The public interest directors at Bank of Ireland do not have a specified time in office as stated in response to PQ 49476/12.  The same situation applies to the public interest directors at AIB. In PTSB, there are currently no public interest directors as they stepped down at the AGM in May 2013.</p></reply>

One such additional measure will be the number of newly agreed loan modifications during each reference quarter.  This will be captured for both temporary and permanent restructure types.  A second additional measure will be the performance of restructured loans.  Reporting performance against specific resolution targets, as well as the full suite of KPI&rsquo;s published by the Central Bank on a quarterly basis, should provide a more complete measure of progress in addressing arrears cases. </p><p>  The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets document published last March, sets out the specific reporting requirements by the individual institutions.  Institutions are required to report their performance against public targets on a quarterly basis to the Central Bank.  These returns are due to be submitted to the Central Bank not later than 22 working days after quarter end.</p><p>  The first quarter in which the targets became operational was Q2, ending in June 2013.

However, I am assuming that they Deputy's question relates to the risk that an employee who becomes self employed will not register, pay appropriate taxes etc.</p><p>  The position is that the new electronic system for RCT, eRCT, which was introduced by Revenue provides a significant safeguard in such situations in relation to contractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.  With the elimination of the C2 certificate, eRCT requires principal contractors to automatically deduct 20% tax on payments made to all new sub-contractors that they engage.  This operates as a significant disincentive to those principals and sub-contractors who may seek to collude to manipulate what is effectively an employer/employee relationship into one of self-employment for the purposes of reducing the tax and PRSI liability of the sub-contractor and the PRSI charge for the employer.</p><p>  I am also informed that Revenue's hand in detecting possible arrangements between principal contractors and former employees is significantly strengthened under the eRCT regime by the access the Commissioners now have to quality information on contracts, the ability to monitor transactions in realtime and the facility to adjust the tax rate of a sub-contractor to 35% if required in cases of non compliance.  As well as reducing the administrative burden on principal contractors, this new system has also minimised the likelihood of errors and opportunities for abuse, including employment misclassification.</p><p>  Further details on the eRCT system are available on Revenue's website at<i> www.revenue.ie</i>.  If the Deputy has specific information about suspected abuse, he should bring the matter to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.   Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship. Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &#8220;<i>designated person</i>&#8221; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &#8220;<i>financial institution</i>  &#8221;. In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.</p><p>  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.</p><p>  In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

In respect of INBS, I am advised by the Special Liquidators that following the reconstitution of the Board of INBS in late 2009, the new Board conducted (over 2010-2011) a wide ranging investigation into historic lending practices and corporate governance issues in INBS.  This included an investigation into the role played by the former auditors of INBS, KPMG.  Following these investigations, the then Board of INBS, on foot of legal advice, made a decision not to institute proceedings against KPMG the former auditors of INBS.

A pilot scheme was established in February 2012 and was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme will enable any eligible families to remain in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.    The Housing Agency, which manages the scheme, has advised that the lenders currently operating the scheme are:</p><p>- AIB</p><p>- EBS</p><p>- BOI</p><p>- PTSB</p><p>- KBCI</p><p>- Pepper</p><p>- Start Mortgages</p><p>- Nua Homeloans</p><p>- Ulster Bank</p><p>- Danske Bank</p><p>- Haven Mortgages</p><p>The Housing Agency has advised me that, based on the latest available information, 1,289 cases have been submitted by lenders and of these,   847 are still in the system with a total of 510 approved for customer contact.</p><p>  The necessary overall strategy and building blocks to address the mortgage arrears problem are now in place. These include the Central Bank mortgage restructuring targets initiative, the new Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the fundamental change to personal insolvency legislation including the provision of new, more accessible and less penal resolution mechanisms to debtors as well as a comprehensive mortgage information and advice service.</p><p>  The onus is now on lenders to move to address individual arrears cases in a comprehensive and speedy manner. The Deputy will be aware that the latest Central Bank data on mortgage arrears and repossessions shows that at end March 2013 there were 144 split mortgage restructures.   I expect the banks to increase the number of &#8220;split mortgage&#8221; and the other long term restructured mortgage arrangements over the remainder of this year.</p></reply>

I would note that the commitments identified as on track are well advanced.  The Department of the Taoiseach published the Programme for Government Annual Report 2013 which outlined progress for all Programme for Government Commitments to March and is available at <i>www.taoiseach.gov.ie</i>   . Since the publication of that report there has been further progress in a number of areas including the extension of the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, the introduction of the Property Tax on the 1st July 2013 and continuing augmentation of the skill set of the Department.</p><p>The timeline for delivery of the commitments is over the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>The following table sets out all Programme for Government commitments assigned to the Department of Finance, and the current status of each commitment:</p><p><bu>Programme for Government</bu></p><p><bu>Department of Finance &ndash; Progress on Commitments</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Commitment</th><th>Status</th></tr><tr><td>We will seek a reduced interest rate as part of a credible re-commitment to reducing Government deficits to ensure sustainability of our public finances. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will re-commit to structural reforms required to accelerate growth, job creation and debt sustainability. </td><td>D/PER</td></tr><tr><td>We will attach the utmost priority to avoiding further down-grades to our sovereign credit rating by setting further capital spend by the State on bank recapitalisation at a level that is consistent with national debt sustainability. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>In this regard, we will defer further recapitalisation of the banks until the solvency stress tests are complete and known to the new Government. Earlier recapitalisation in advance of publication of the stress tests will not contribute to market stability and confidence. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We remain committed to a smaller banking system that reduces its reliance on funding from the Irish and European Central Banks and volatile market sources. In order, however, to limit further calls on the State to cover bank losses from distressed asset sales, bank de-leveraging must be paced to match the return of more normal market conditions and demand for bank assets. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>As an interim measure, we will seek to replace emergency lending to our banks with medium-term, affordable, official financing in a way that can restore confidence among other potential lenders in the liquidity position of our banks. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will end further asset transfers to NAMA, which are unlikely to improve market confidence in either the banks or the State. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund small and medium-sized businesses in the real economy during the re-structuring and down-sizing programme. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a comprehensive special resolution regime for dealing with bank insolvencies. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>The Government accepts that enabling provisions in legislation may be necessary to extend the scope of bank liability restructuring to include unsecured, unguaranteed senior bonds. </td><td>Review</td></tr><tr><td>The new Government will seek to dispose of the public stakes in the banks as soon as possible at the best possible return to the taxpayer. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will create an integrated decision making structure among all relevant State Departments and Agencies to replace the current fragmented approach of State bodies in dealing with the financial crisis. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>The new Government will re-structure bank boards and replace directors who presided over failed lending practices. We will ensure that the regulator has sufficient powers of pre-approval of bank directors and senior executives. To expedite this change-over we will openly construct a pool of globally experienced financial services managers and directors to be inserted into key executive and non-executive positions in banks receiving taxpayer support. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will insist on the highest standards of transparency in the operation of NAMA, on reduction in the costs associated with the operation of NAMA, and that decision-making in NAMA does not delay the restoration of the Irish property market. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>Once the banking sector has been restored and is functioning effectively, we will introduce a bank levy based on the size of a bank's liabilities (other than shareholder capital). </td><td>Review </td></tr><tr><td>We recognise the important role of Credit Unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions. In Government, we will establish a Commission to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for Credit Unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We support the future development of the IFSC as a source of future employment growth, subject to appropriate regulation. We will establish a taskforce on the future of the financial services sector to maximise employment opportunities in financial services for staff leaving employment as a result of downsizing. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that the investigations into failures in the banking system are adequately resourced.</td><td>D/PER</td></tr><tr><td>All remuneration schemes at banks subject to state support will undergo a fundamental review to ensure an alignment of interest between banks, their staff and the taxpayer. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Cut the 13.5% rate of VAT to 12% up to end 2013</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will exempt from VAT service companies that export more than 90% of their output.</td><td>Not being pursued</td></tr><tr><td>Subject to a cost benefit analysis, we will amend the RD tax credit regime to make it more attractive and accessible to smaller businesses, in the following ways: companies with RD expenditures of under &euro;100,000 will be entitled to full tax credit on those entire expenditures as opposed to just the increment over the base year, with marginal relief for companies with expenditure just over &euro;100,000, we will allow companies to offset the RD credit against employers. PRSI as an alternative to corporation tax, to cut down on red tape in the applications process, companies in receipt of a Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) grant from one of the development agencies will be automatically deemed as entitled to the RD tax credit. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will direct the Revenue Commissioners to examine the feasibility of introducing - on a revenue neutral basis - a Single Business Tax for micro enterprises (with a turnover of less than &euro;75,000 per annum) to replace all the existing taxes on sole traders and small businesses to cut compliance costs and make starting a business much less daunting. </td><td>Review </td></tr><tr><td>We will create a Strategic Investment Bank that will become a provider of finance to large capital projects, a conduit for venture capital and a lender to SMEs. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>The Government will put in place a parallel, commercially-financed investment programme in key networks of the economy to support demand and employment in the short-term, and to provide the basis for sustainable, export-led jobs and growth for the next generation.  Streamlined and restructured semi-States will make significant additional investments, over and above current plans, over the next four years in &#8220;next generation&#8221; infrastructures in energy, broadband, forestry and water. These investments - and the accompanying semi-state restructuring process - will be financed and pro-actively managed by a New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA), which will absorb the National Pension Reserve Commission.</td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We believe it is appropriate, in order to enhance international credibility, to stick to the aggregate adjustment as set out in the National Recovery Plan for the combined period 20112012. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>In preparation for Budget 2013, we will review progress on deficit reduction, and draw up a plan which will achieve the objective of reaching the 3% of GDP target for the General Government Deficit by the target date of 2015. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Should Ireland succeed in obtaining a lower interest rate on its loans, this should be offset against the aggregate adjustment required over the term of the programme. </td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We believe that achieving the 3% of GDP deficit target should be seen as an intermediate step in the process of restoring the public finances, and that further reductions in the general government deficit as a share of national income will be required thereafter</td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>As part of our fiscal strategy the new Government will: Keep the corporate tax rate at 12.5%</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Maintain the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits. We will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income. </td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We will reduce, cap or abolish property tax reliefs and other tax shelters which benefit very high income earners. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will also ensure the implementation of a minimum effective tax rate of 30% for very high earners.</td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>Consider, arising from the previous Government's deal with the IMF, various options for a site valuation tax. Any site valuation tax must take into account the significant number of households in mortgage distress and provide local government with a reliable stream of revenue</td><td>Achieved (As per Government decision to introduce Local Property Tax)</td></tr><tr><td>We will limit the top rate of VAT to 23%</td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We will review the Universal Social Charge  </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that tax exiles make a fair contribution to the Exchequer</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish an independent Fiscal Advisory Council (FAC), separated from fiscal decision-makers in government, that would undertake official fiscal macroeconomic projections and monitoring.  Its functions would include identifying and advising on cyclical and counter-cyclical fiscal policies and structural deficits; the cyclical or temporary nature of particular revenues; and the need to maintain an appropriate and effective tax base. The Fiscal Advisory Council will be independent of Government and will report to the D&aacute;il and the public. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>The modelling assumptions and inputs of the Fiscal Advisory Council will, as far as possible, be open to public scrutiny and its outputs would be freely available to external bodies, including in particular, the opposition parties. </td><td>Matter for the Fiscal Council</td></tr><tr><td>We will open up the Budget process to the full glare of public scrutiny in a way that restores confidence and stability by exposing and cutting failing programmes and pork barrel politics. </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will reform the Department of Finance by bringing in new leadership and skills to restore its capacity and credibility in financial and macroeconomic management. Specifically, we will make an external appointment of an economist of international repute to head up the Department's Budget and Economic Policy division.   </td><td>In progress<br /><br />(New leadership in place)<br /><br />(Recruitment process underway for Chief Economist)</td></tr><tr><td>We will bring new talent and skills into the Department of Finance. </td><td>Achieved (Ongoing)</td></tr><tr><td>Tax incentives for private hospital developments will cease. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers in 2004-08 (from the current sliding scale of 20% to 25% depending on the year the mortgage was taken out), financed in part by bringing forward the abolition of relief for new buyers from June 2011. </td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>Directing any mortgage provider in receipt of State support to present Government with a plan of how intends to cut its costs, over and above existing plans, in a fair manner by a sufficient amount to forego a 25 basis point increase on their variable rate mortgage. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a two year moratorium on repossessions of modest family homes where a family makes an honest effort to pay their mortgage. </td><td>In progress (Policies in respect of Mortgage Arrears in progress)</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator supervise credit institutions' mortgage lending practices comprehensively and intensively.</td><td>In progress (whilst respecting the independence of Central Bank and Financial Regulator)</td></tr><tr><td>Where credit institutions fail to adequately control mortgage lending risks, the Central Bank will impose loan-to-value ceilings on mortgages, caps on loan-to income multiples, limits on the term of new mortgages, and more rigorous procedures for verifying borrowers' incomes.</td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>Increase the penalty for tobacco smuggling for commercial purposes and provide robust detection measures to counteract such smuggling.</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Seek to combat drug supplies at source by providing x-ray scanners at major ports; greater patrols along coastline and increasing presence of Customs officers at smaller airports.</td><td>Review </td></tr><tr><td>Tightly regulate moneylenders.</td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We will accelerate Capital Allowances on software purchases against income tax and corporation profits tax from 8 to 3 years subject to a cost benefit analysis.  </td><td>In progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will exempt farm diesel from further increases in the carbon tax.</td><td>Achieved</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In 2011, a one off specific service was provided by an external PR adviser at a cost of &euro;169.40. However they have also advised my Department that as part of the National Payments Plan, marketing agencies have been and will be engaged to assist in developing communications plans relating to specific, defined public policy initiatives (e.g. the on-going public information campaign around Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) implementation, and the running of a &lsquo;rounding pilot&rsquo; to reduce the need for 1c/2c coins). These agencies have been and will be selected through competitive tender processes, and the costs of these will be split between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and industry.   The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau have advised my Department that they do not employ the services of a public relations firm or communication consultants and that all such work is dealt with internally by Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau staff.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has supplied my Department with the information set out below. NTMA does not maintain an internal press office. Instead, its internal communications resources are supported by an external service provider (appointed following a public procurement process) &ndash; currently Gordon MRM - in order to offer a full press office and communications service (including out-of-hours contacts for the media) across all the NTMA&rsquo;s business areas: Debt Management, National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), National Pensions Reserve Fund, National Development Finance Agency, State Claims Agency, NewERA and during 2011 the Banking Unit. These arrangements were initially put in place during 2010 in light of a significant increase in the volume of domestic and international media queries being received by the NTMA and associated bodies. In September 2012 the NTMA retendered for the provision of these services. Following the tender evaluation process the NTMA awarded a new contract to Gordon MRM in December 2012. The initial contract, in place to end 2012 was based on an hourly rate for services provided. During the term of this contract a 20% reduction in the hourly rate was agreed with effect from June 2011 until the end of the contract. The new contract, which commenced in January 2013, is based on a fixed fee and it is anticipated that this will result in a significant reduction in the overall fees paid by the NTMA. NAMA draws on the NTMA&rsquo;s shared services in a number of areas including its outsourced press office facility.  NAMA reimburses the NTMA in respect of the costs of these services attributable to NAMA. The overall costs incurred for the provision of the services above (ex VAT) were as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;205,388 (of which &euro;112,353 was charged to NAMA)</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;223,723 (of which &euro;142,653 was charged to NAMA)</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;72,817 (to end June) (of which &euro;36,329 was charged to NAMA)</td></tr></table></p><p>In the light of the sovereign debt crisis the NTMA also engaged Powerscourt &ndash; a London based communications consultancy - for international communications initiatives in the funding and debt management area.  Total costs (ex VAT) incurred for the provision of the services provided by Powerscourt from January 2011 were as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>74,395 euros</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>10,257 euros</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>12,103 euros (to end June) </td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am advised by NAMA that, in respect of such unsold property, it requires its debtors and receivers to comply with all statutory obligations.  NAMA advises that this includes the payment of development levies as they fall due, on foot of a valid planning permission, for development.  NAMA further advises that it works closely with debtors and receivers to ensure that any such liabilities are appropriately addressed.  NAMA&rsquo;s role relates only to those properties that secure its acquired loans.  It has no role in relation to other properties, including any properties sold prior to its acquisition of loans from the Participating Institutions.  The Deputy may also wish to refer to pages 36 and 37 of the Agency&rsquo;s recently published Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2012, which include extensive information on NAMA&rsquo;s approach to unfinished housing developments, including its requirement that debtors and receivers prepare, in line with best practice in this area, a Site Resolution Plan with input from stakeholders including residents, the local authority and the bond holder.</p><p>  NAMA is prohibited under Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act from disclosing confidential information, which is specifically defined to include information relating to its debtors and their properties.

The Central Bank has advised me that it has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the CCMA under part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.</p><p>  The CCMA applies to the mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except credit unions, operating in the State, including: </p><p>- A financial services provider authorised, registered or licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland; and</p><p>- A financial services provider authorised, registered or licensed in another EU or EEA Member State and which has provided, or is providing, mortgage lending activities in the State. </p><p>  The CCMA applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his/her primary residence. </p><p>  Under the CCMA, lenders must apply the protections of the Code to borrowers in the following circumstances:</p><p>  i. Borrowers in arrears and in pre-arrears</p><p>  ii. In the case of joint borrowers who notify the lender in writing that they have separated or divorced, the lender should treat each borrower as a single borrower under the CCMA (except to the extent that an action requires, as a matter of law, the agreement of both borrowers)</p><p>  Chapter 3 of the CCMA deals with the appeals process and provides that a lender must have an appeals process to enable a borrower to appeal in relation to a decision of the lender, including:</p><p>(a) where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender and the borrower is not willing to enter into the alternative repayment arrangement;</p><p>(b) Where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement to a borrower; and</p><p>(c) Where a lender classifies a borrower as not co-operating,</p><p>  and for this purpose must establish an Appeals Board to consider and determine any such appeals submitted by borrowers.</p><p>  Section 50 of the CCMA states that the Appeals Board must be comprised of three of the lender's senior personnel, who have not been involved in the borrower's case previously.  At least one member of the Appeals Board must be independent of the lender's management team and must not be involved in lending matters.  In addition, the lender must apply Provisions 10.7 and 10.12 of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 to deal with complaints submitted by borrowers in relation to the lender's treatment of the borrower's case under the CCMA, or the lender's compliance with the requirements of the CCMA.</p></reply>

A figure of &euro;250 million was included in the Budget 2013 arithmetic for this measure and was, as clearly stated in the Budget 2013 documentation, a provisional figure pending further detailed analysis of the changes necessary to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment. That analysis is ongoing and involves consideration of changes to the SFT as well as other potential alternative changes relating to the treatment of supplementary pension arrangements.</p><p>  As regards the proposal to have the income ceiling link for pension tax reliefs reduced to &euro;70,000 per annum, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year. The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions. </p><p>  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. </p><p>  There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to &euro;70,000 and confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &euro;555 million.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-16a.572.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071600080#WRM02400"><p>Firstly, I would like to briefly comment on Revenue&rsquo;s approach to tax collection and in particular its overall compliance and debt management approach.   Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that every individual and business complies with the responsibility to pay the right amount of tax or duty, including any interest and penalties which are due, in full and on time. This is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse. Delays in the collection of tax revenues properly due adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses.  Revenue also has to guard against so-called &ldquo;phoenix&rdquo; businesses where tax debts are left unpaid from a previous business.</p><p>  Where payment of a tax debt in a single sum is not possible for the taxpayer or business, perhaps due to temporary cashflow difficulties, then Revenue may, and regularly does, agree to a phased payment arrangement. In such circumstances the onus is on the taxpayer or business to make realistic proposals to Revenue that will see the debt being addressed in the shortest possible timescale. A key condition of any such arrangement is that current taxes are paid as they fall due.  </p><p>  I note that in 2012 Revenue granted in excess of 16,000 instalment arrangements covering &euro;124m of debt to taxpayers experiencing cashflow difficulties. I am very happy that this level of concession clearly confirms Revenue&rsquo;s commitment to assist viable businesses during our current economic difficulties.</p><p>  Remedying late or non-compliance is preferably achieved through engagement with the business or taxpayer, but when that engagement is only partially forthcoming, or perhaps not at all, then Revenue has no option but to utilise measures such as the charging and collection of interest or the deployment of effective enforcement measures to secure payment of the tax debt, to encourage future voluntary timely compliance and to ensure a &lsquo;level playing field&rsquo; for the vast majority of taxpayers who meet their obligations in full and on time.</p><p>  In circumstances where Revenue has to use enforcement measures to secure collection of outstanding taxes, the type of enforcement deployed will always depend on the specific circumstances of a case. However, Revenue generally refers such cases to either the Sheriff or Solicitor in the first instance. Where the Solicitor option is deployed, there is the possibility of judgments being secured through the Courts which result in instalment orders, or in judgment mortgages being placed on properties. Revenue has confirmed to me that the use of judgment mortgages is normally to secure a tax debt in the event of a property being sold by the taxpayer. It does not necessarily mean that Revenue intends to &lsquo;force&rsquo; sale the property, and the Deputy may wish to be aware that as a matter of operational policy, Revenue has never forced the sale of a family home.</p></reply>

To the best of our knowledge, the content and existence of the tapes was not discussed at the Board meetings following March 2012.  I have been advised by the Central Bank that subsequent to the 2008 Guarantee, the Central Bank implemented a more intensive supervisory approach to covered institutions subject to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008.  This more intensive approach includes attendance at committee and board meetings periodically.  The purpose is to observe internal governance in operation, in order to understand the decision making process and also to be aware of individual risks across the covered institutions. The Central Bank does not participate in such meetings and Central  Bank officials are not part of the decision making process at those meetings, nor do they otherwise participate in the management of the covered institution. The Central Bank may subsequently follow up items discussed for clarity to raise concerns e.g. how a particular committee operates. </p><p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that as Central Bank officials attend board meetings as part of their supervisory responsibilities they are not able (under Section 33AK) to divulge relevant information.

If the financial situation of a bank deteriorates beyond repair, national authorities will have a common toolkit and roadmap to manage the failure of banks in an orderly fashion, with a "bail-in" mechanism to call on shareholders and creditors when attributing losses of failed banks. The bail-in tool will significantly reduce the cost of bank restructuring for the State if future crises emerge. </p><p>  Where bail-in is applied, the institutions&rsquo; creditors would be written down in a pre-defined order to enable the institution to regain viability. In short, shareholders would bear losses first. Once shareholders claims have been exhausted subordinated creditors would then be written down. Only when these claims have been exhausted could senior creditors be written down, with preference for eligible deposits over &euro;100,000 of natural persons, small, medium and micro-entities. A minimum 8% of total liabilities including own funds must be bailed-in before Member States are afforded a limited flexibility to use other sources of funding including public support. </p><p>  The Council agreement provides that covered depositors i.e. deposits up to &euro;100,000 that are protected under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) will always be excluded from bail-in. These depositors will be fully protected in any resolution action.</p><p>  The Deputy raises a question on the specific application of the new bank resolution rules to Anglo Irish Bank in a hypothetical scenario. In the event that the bail-in tool was available when the crisis struck and that Anglo had been put into resolution other decisions surrounding Anglo may have been taken differently, by regulators and by creditors. Even with the benefit of hindsight it would not be possible to estimate with any degree of certainty if the existence of the bail-in tool would have avoided the need for any State support for Anglo.</p></reply>

Under Irish tax legislation a company incurring a trading loss in an accounting year can carry that loss back for offset against profits in the immediately preceding year. The carry back of a trading loss is limited to one accounting year back and there must be profits in that year for the provision to be of use to a company. A trading loss in an accounting year may also be carried forward for offset against trading profits of the same trade in subsequent years.  Ireland follows the international norm in this regard.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the potential saving to the Exchequer, if future claims by incorporated bodies for losses to be offset against previous year&rsquo;s profits were to be disallowed, would depend on the amounts of losses incurred by companies and the extent to which there are profits in the preceding accounting year against which such losses would otherwise be available for set-off. It is not possible to anticipate what these would be.</p><p>  By way of illustrating this latter point, data from corporation tax returns for 2010 and 2011 (the latest years available) show that for 2010 the amount of trading losses carried back for offset against profits earned in a previous year was &euro;445m while the comparable figure for 2011 is in the region of &euro;552m. The actual saving to the Exchequer in respect of those years under the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would depend on the tax rate applicable to the profits of the companies concerned but assuming that this was the standard 12.5% rate, the savings under the proposal would have amounted to about &euro;56m in 2010 and about &euro;69m in 2011. The Deputy should note, however, that the estimated savings for 2010 and 2011 are not necessarily indicative of what the savings might be for future years. Also, since under the proposal companies could continue to carry forward losses for offset against future profits, the estimated Exchequer savings outlined would be temporary in nature.</p><p>  I should add that losses incurred in a trade are a fact of business life and the provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and that of all other countries in the OECD. It would be difficult to justify taxing business income without taking due account of business losses.</p></reply>

Section 440 provides for an additional charge of corporation tax (referred to as a surcharge) on undistributed investment and estate income of close companies. A close company will be liable to a surcharge of 20% on any investment and rental income that is not distributed within 18 months of the accounting period in which that income was earned. Section 441 provides for a similar surcharge of 15% on 50% of any trading or professional income of a professional service close company that is not distributed within 18 months of the relevant accounting period. &euro;2,000 may be retained by a close company without incurring a surcharge. </p><p>  A close company is a company under the control of five or fewer participators, or of more than five participators who are directors, including their associates. Broadly speaking, a participator is any person with a share or interest in the capital or income of a company. A service company is a close company whose business consists of carrying on a profession or providing professional services or which exercises an office or employment.</p><p>  With regard to the treatment of tax free lump sums on retirement I assume that the Deputy is referring to an ex-gratia lump sum which might be awarded out of company funds to a director on ending employment with a company and not a pension lump sum paid out of the director&rsquo;s approved pension scheme.</p><p>  Section 123 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 imposes, (subject to a number of exemptions and reliefs provided under section 201 and Schedule 3 of that Act), a charge to income tax in respect of ex-gratia payments made by employers on the termination of an employment, where the payment would not otherwise be chargeable to income tax under general income tax law.  </p><p>  Statutory redundancy payments are exempt from income tax.  In addition, ex-gratia redundancy payments or retirement gratuities in excess of the statutory redundancy amount can qualify for exemption, with the exempt amount varying according to the number of years service of the individual, the level of earnings in the last three years of employment and the individual&rsquo;s entitlement to any tax-free lump sum from an approved pension scheme. </p><p>  The maximum tax-free element of an ex-gratia payment made in respect of termination of an employment or office is limited to &euro;200,000.  This overall limit is a lifetime cap and applies in all cases other than where an ex-gratia payment is made on death or disability. </p><p>  There is a separate, additional maximum lifetime tax-free limit of &euro;200,000 on ex-gratia payments made on the death of an employee/director or where the payment is made solely on account of disability of, or injury to, the employee/director. </p><p>  In the circumstances, charging the excess over &euro;200,000 of any payment at a rate of 40% as capital acquisitions tax, rather than at the marginal income tax rate of 41% plus USC, would result in a loss to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

It is the Government's vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.    The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and the recent Credit Review Office (CRO) report commented &#8220;At the end of quarter 1, both banks' sanctions are on or near where they would be expected to meet the target, taking account of the seasonality which has been identified over the past two years.&#8221; </p><p>  The pillar banks are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes. The CRO is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit. The recent CRO report shows that the Office upheld the credit appeal in 135 cases or 57% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;16.8m credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,297 jobs. This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the CRO and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. </p><p>  The latest data provided by the Central Bank indicates that the drawdown of new lending by non-financial SMEs from credit institutions in Ireland was &euro;587m in the first quarter of 2013. Figures for the equivalent period in 2012 show drawdowns of &euro;579m. Figures for the full year 2012 show drawdowns of &euro;2.56bn.  </p><p>For the Deputy's information, the relevant statistics for credit made available to small business are accessible at:   <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p></reply>

This served to erode Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness; making it more difficult for Irish firms to compete on the world stage and more vulnerable to external shocks. This manifested in a loss of Ireland&rsquo;s share of world trade from 2002.   Looking to the current situation, HICP inflation increased in Ireland by 0.7 per cent year-on-year in June and has averaged just 0.8 per cent over the first half of the year, compared to an average of 1.6 per cent in the euro area. Indeed Irish inflation has now been below, or on par with the euro area average for every month since March 2008. This has led to a significant improvement in economy-wide competitiveness over the period, with consumer prices having improved in relative terms by 14 percentage points compared to the euro area since 2008.</p><p>  Looking to the future, my Department expects inflation to remain at modest rates for the next few years. Indeed, the European Commission expects Irish inflation rates to be below European rates in both 2013 and 2014.</p></reply>

In this respect, ice-cream parlours selling ice-cream to customers must charge the 23% rate on the supply of ice-cream.   A reduction in the VAT rate on ice-cream would lead to pressure to apply a similar reduction to the wider confectionary and sugary foods area which would be costly to the Exchequer.  I therefore have no plans to change the VAT treatment of ice-cream sold by ice-cream parlours.</p><p>  I would point out that where ice-cream is provided as part of a meal by a caterer, such as a restaurant, the meal, including the ice-cream element, is liable to VAT at the 9% reduced VAT rate. </p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.   Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &ldquo;designated persons&rdquo; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship. Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &quot;designated person&quot; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &quot;financial institution&quot;. In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.</p><p>  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.</p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.</p><p>  In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

The NTMA has business relationships with market participants across the range of its business activities and overseas travel is a necessary part of the performance of the NTMA's business functions.</p><p>  Under the NTMA travel policy it is a duty of each Senior Executive to ensure that only essential travel is undertaken and that the number of persons travelling on official business is kept to a minimum, consistent with the needs of the business unit. They are required to ensure that all travel should be planned so as to reduce the total amount of travel to a minimum consistent with efficiency and that alternatives to travel, such as telephone conference calls or video conferencing be considered.</p><p>  All overseas travel must be authorised in advance and the reasons for travel must be set out.  Reporting on overseas business is carried out as part of the normal reporting of business activities.</p><p><b><i>The Irish Financial Advisory Council</i></b></p><p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established on a statutory basis on the 31 December 2012 under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012. The deputy should be aware that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an independent body. The Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 states that the Fiscal Council may regulate its own procedures  and therefore matters relating to the overseas travel undertaken by that agency are a question for the Council themselves. </p><p>  The Council have advised me that any staff travel undertaken is considered necessary and commensurate to business requirements. Approval is given for all travel and it is directly related to official business requirements. The Council have confirmed that travel undertaken is related to business meetings or training courses, the objective of which cannot be achieved through other means. Finally, the Council staff debrief colleagues on the work undertaken and the objectives achieved following their return. </p><p><b><i>Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau</i></b></p><p>  Travel undertaken by staff of the Ombudsman's Office is undertaken only when required for business reasons. All potential travel is discussed with the Ombudsman before being undertaken. Individual staff representing the Bureau on business would always advise the Ombudsman of meetings attended.</p><p><b><i>Central Bank</i></b></p><p>  Under the Central Bank Acts and the Statute governing the European System of Central Banks, the Central Bank is an independent institution not subject to the Minister for Finance or the Government in the discharge of its functions.  The management of travel arrangements for the staff of the Bank is determined by the executive of the Board of the Bank.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013. Following that deadline, the NCSE processed all these applications as expeditiously as possible in order to allow schools and principals sufficient time to plan for the coming school year.

In particular, this approach gives schools clarity on their supports for the coming year.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children on the level which applied last year.

Following a visit to the school by officials from the Building Unit of my Department and an examination of the tender documentation it emerged that the school had increased the scope of works from what was approved.  The school authorities were advised that the application for additional funding was unsuccessful as the Department was satisfied that the grant provided was sufficient to provide the level of approved accommodation. The school authorities have been advised to reduce the scope of works to that approved by the Department.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there are many competing demands on my Department's capital resources and in this context it must prioritise applications for the provision of much needed additional mainstream classroom accommodation.</p></reply>

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.</p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012. This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme. At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%. Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. </p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them. If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents. Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books. </p><p>  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them. I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes. All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year. </p><p>  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. </p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012. This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes. None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.</p></reply>

Pupils with mild speech and language difficulties may qualify for supplementary teaching support from within the school's general allocation of learning support/teaching support. </p><p>  Pupils with SSLD who also have significant care needs may also qualify for access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support. It is important to note that SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles. The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need. In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and/or resource teacher. SNAs are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs. </p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the provision of health supports, including Speech and Language Therapy services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p><p>  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.   </p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations were considered on a case by case basis.  Applications in this regard required supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home. </p><p>  An appeal regarding the joint allocation to the siblings to whom the Deputy refers was unsuccessful and the original decision was upheld.</p></reply>

If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by SUSI, and remains of the view that SUSI has not interpreted the scheme correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the Student Grant Appeals Board. The relevant appeal form will be available on request from SUSI.</p></reply>

The NCSE consulted widely with parents of children with special educational needs, representative bodies and the education partners in preparing this policy advice. Inter alia, the report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in the report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new model for the allocation of teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools. Mr Eamonn Stack, who is the NCSE Chairperson and former Chief Inspector in my Department, will chair this working group and the group, which will include parents, will begin its work immediately. The work of the group will be a matter for the working group itself. The group will report to me in September on the progress of its work, to develop advice on how to reform the way the substantial additional teaching resources for pupils with special educational needs are allocated in the school system.</p></reply>

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers. The redeployment arrangements for the 2013/14 school year are set out in the Staffing Circular 0013/2013 and the FAQ document on Main Panels both of which are available on the Department website. Surplus permanent/CID holding teachers may opt to accept a post outside the 45 km radius of their former school within their existing panel area. The arrangements for panel access for fixed term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers for the 2013/14 school year are set out in Department Circular 0038/2012 which is available on the Department website. The supplementary panel set up in accordance with the arrangements set out in this circular will be used for appointments to full-time permanent posts in primary schools but only where those posts are not otherwise required to facilitate the redeployment of surplus permanent and CID holding teachers.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, approved course, previous academic attainment and means. Currently maintenance support is not available for students entering postgraduate courses. However, those who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. A postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2013/14 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents. The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application, it would not be possible to say if the student would qualify for a student grant. To determine eligibility for the 2013/14 academic year the student should submit an online grant application to Student Universal Support Ireland via www.susi.ie. Eligibility for welfare support is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection. Any changes to its qualifying criteria for the back to education allowance are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. I wish to clarify also that there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs. The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools. Therefore, even if the number of students receiving SNA support rises, this does not necessarily mean that the required number of SNAs to support their care needs should rise by a similar percentage. The initial allocation of SNAs for the coming school year will support about 22,000 pupils. This is at about the same level supported in December 2012, despite the passing of 6 months. To date the NCSE has allocated over 10,490 SNA posts to schools which leaves over 80 posts available for allocation during the school year. The NCSE has advised that they have processed all applications for SNA support this year and have allocated the level of SNA support to schools that it considers will meet the care needs of all qualifying pupils. These allocations have been made in line with DES policy and there has been no change in the policy or its application this year. Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2013/2014 school year are now available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. Schools in Gaeltacht areas have historically operated the same staffing schedule as ordinary schools for the creation of a classroom teaching post at primary level. A slightly more favourable schedule operated for the Gaeltacht schools to retain a post between the bands of four and twelve classroom teachers. The standardisation of the staffing schedule for Gaelscoileanna so that it is the same as that which applies to primary schools generally was one of a number of measures introduced in Budget 2011 by the previous government to control and reduce teacher numbers. These changes came into effect from September 2011. Given the financial constraints in which this country now finds itself, it is not possible to reverse these changes.</p><p>  The criteria used to allocate teachers to schools, including Gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools is published annually on the Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the2013/14 school year are set out in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the website. The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for the allocation of classroom teachers to all primary schools. It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p><p>  The Staffing Schedule significantly advantages small primary schools. For example, a 2-classroom teacher school with 30 pupils has an average class size of 15 pupils. In contrast, a typical 10-classroom teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils. One of the savings measures in Budget 2012 was a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools including Gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools. The impact of the budget measure means that the staffing levels in small primary schools will no longer be as favourable as they were previously but they will still be better than the Staffing Schedule general average of 28:1 that operates in medium to larger schools. A new appeals process for small schools was introduced as part of the Budget 2012 measure. This enables small schools that are due to lose a classroom post as a result of the budget measure to retain the classroom post on the basis of their projected enrolments. The allocation process at individual school level is currently underway. The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p></reply>

However, my Department has a broader concern that training and education offerings are aligned with the needs of industry. Officials of my Department met representatives of the hospitality industry to discuss the issue and we will continue to examine the availability of genuine job opportunities in this area and examine the training offerings in that light. It should be noted that FAS has recently developed a small number of foundation level courses in catering and hospitality through its Local Training Initiatives, Community Training Centres and Specialist Training Providers. These awards/modules are offered in response to specific local requests where there is a recognised employment opportunity.</p></reply>

SOLAS, the new education and training authority, is being established as a funding and oversight body under the aegis of my Department to ensure the provision of 21st century high-quality further education and training programmes to learners. Section 9 of the Further Education and Training Bill 2013 provides that SOLAS, once established, will prepare and submit to the Minister, a strategy in respect of further education and training.

The Department's Inspectorate, in its work with schools, promotes active learning approaches rather than over-reliance on textbooks and workbooks. The Department has issued Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools  and these outline a number of strategies to avoid the need for workbooks or to allow workbooks to be reused from year to year. Scoilnet.ie is the Department's Official education portal. It contains curriculum relevant digital resources and supports for  use by teachers. The site is being redeveloped in 2013 and will support the inclusion and sharing of learning objects. The website will become a repository of Open Educational Resources (OER) where the assets and resources developed by teachers, former support services and others involved in education can be centrally collated and found. The site currently has approximately 13,000 existing resources. The Department provides funding towards the provision of ICT equipment for both Primary and Post Primary schools where an extension/refurbishment project or a new school building is being provided. For Primary Schools the allocation is &euro;5,000 per mainstream classroom. For Post Primary Schools the amount of funding for ICT equipment is calculated based on the Schedule of Accommodation and the subjects being taught in the school.</p></reply>

The decision came into effect for the 2012/13 academic year. As the Deputy will be aware, priority is being given to protecting resources for front line services in the coming years. However, to assist with the costs of the Gaeltacht placement, primary initial education students who are in receipt of a student grant which includes a 100% fee grant, or who would have qualified for a full fee grant but for the Free Fees Schemes, can apply for funding towards travel and accommodation costs under the field trip element of a fee grant, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the student grant scheme. Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential , discretionary basis.</p></reply>

The importance of physical activity in schools is reflected in the new Framework for Junior Cycle, which I launched in October 2012. A short course in PE is currently being designed by the NCCA. It will be available for consultation in the autumn and it will be available for schools to implement from September 2014. This short course will be designed for 100 hours duration. Schools may choose to incorporate this short course into their junior cycle programme, either for certification purposes or not for certification. Alternatively, they may choose not to opt for the new course and may instead continue to use existing courses or other approaches to meet the requirements in this area. Therefore, there is no basis for the concerns expressed by the National Activity Planning Group. Understandably, some concerns have been expressed that the proposed reforms will result in the downgrading of certain subjects taught in second level schools. I want to assure you that this is certainly not the intention of the reforms and I am satisfied this will not be an unintended consequence either. Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decision on what is offered at the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from that reflects their interests. Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle. I have every confidence that the changes envisaged in the Framework for Junior Cycle will ensure that the place of physical education will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.</p></reply>

In 2011 a total of 413 classrooms were delivered on the completion of 42 large scale projects and 267 classrooms were provided under the Additional Accommodation Scheme. In 2012 a total of 421 classrooms were delivered on the completion of 39 large scale projects and 212 classrooms were provided under the Additional Accommodation Scheme.</p><p>Data in respect of 2013 will not be available until the end of the year. The Deputy will be aware that under my Department's 2012 Prefab Replacement Initiative, approval was given to 170 schools nationally to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation. In excess of &euro;42m was allocated for this initiative of which &euro;27.2m has been paid to date. Of these a total of 142 projects have gone to construction and 55 of these have been completed. The total rental savings achieved by the 55 completed projects are in the region of &euro;1m. These figures will be subject to change as further projects are completed. The initiative will result in savings of approximately &euro;5m per annum on the rental of prefabs in these schools in the coming years.</p><p>  In June of this year, I announced a further Prefab Replacement Initiative to replace in the region 115 prefabs in 46 schools with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;15m has been allocated in 2013/2014 and this further initiative will result in additional rental savings of &euro;2.5m per annum. In the post-primary school sector the provision of permanent school places is measured in terms of the Long Term Projected Enrolment (LTPE). In 2011 a total of 8,640 permanent school places were delivered in the post-primary sector with the completion of 9 large scale projects and 42 additional accommodation projects. In 2012 a total of 5,541 additional permanent school places were delivered in the post-primary sector with the completion of 9 large scale projects and 29 additional accommodation projects. Data in respect of 2013 will not be available until the end of the year. In 2011 the total expenditure on large scale projects amounted to &euro;205m and on additional accommodation amounted to &euro;56m. In 2012 the total expenditure on large scale projects amounted to &euro;224m and on additional accommodation amounted to just over &euro;56m. It is not possible to predict accurately the number of classrooms that will be completed in 2013 due to the many variables that can arise on the school building programme. Capital funding available for the delivery of classrooms is on a par with last year but actual expenditure and the level of drawdown of such funding varies from month to month and the 2013 outturn will only be available at year end. Data on a county basis is not readily available.</p></reply>

Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. I wish to advise the Deputies also that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities. My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions. However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. In the course of my recent meeting with Down Syndrome Ireland a number of issues were raised which I consider merit further examination. Accordingly I have asked my officials to consider these issues further and to provide a full response to Down Syndrome Ireland on the issues raised as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Since then the Council has been involved in further consultation with local interests and it is my understanding that a Joint Working Group has been established with representative from Dublin City Council, Clontarf Residents Association and Clontarf Business Association to consider possibilities for the development of the Clontarf Promenade which will include flood defence measures. </p><p>  Should a new scheme emerge from the deliberations of the Joint Working Group it will be open to the Council to seek funding from the Office of Public Works for the cost of the flood defence element only of such a scheme if such a flood defence element is found to be financially viable and environmentally acceptable and if it provides the standard of flood protection applicable to OPW funded schemes. </p><p>  It is not possible to say at this stage what the position on the availability of funding will be as this will depend on the amount sought, the number of other flood defence schemes being developed nationally at the time the funding request is received and the associated pressures and demands on the OPW's capital funding allocation.</p><p>  The OPW does not provide funding to local community or voluntary groups to undertake professional and independent services in relation to such projects.</p></reply>

The guidance does not distinguish between micro-enterprises and other SMEs, and the approach set out is intended to be applicable to them all.  These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts. The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>-  supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i> website;</p><p>-  less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;</p><p>-  ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>-  sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</p><p>  In order to promote and improve such practices the National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service  procurement. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs.  Resulting from these discussions the NPS has issued two circulars to all buyers in, and suppliers to, the public service with the aim of improving practice in the procurement arena.  </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>Circular 10/10 has been in place for just over two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard,   I am arranging for my Department to remind public bodies about this aspect of the public procurement guidance and the importance of contracting authorities ensuring they implement it appropriately. </p><p>  Reform of public procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance in the Government's Public Service Reform Plan, which was published in November 2011. Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  In this regard, the NPS has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service's buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: </p><p>-  cash savings; </p><p>  -  administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; </p><p> -  greater purchasing expertise; </p><p>  -  improved consistency; and,</p><p>  -  enhanced service levels. </p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. </p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.  </p><p>  In relation to plans for further reform of public procurement, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published late last year, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the report the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) to lead a key element of the Government's Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement will involve:</p><p>-  integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;</p><p>-  strengthening spend analytics and data management;</p><p>-  much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;</p><p>-  examining the specifications set out for goods and services;</p><p>-  evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and</p><p>-  strengthening supplier and category management.</p><p>  Since the appointment of Paul Quinn, CPO, on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops / meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.</p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work. To ensure the reform process takes account of the needs of stakeholders, further consultations will be undertaken with employees and workers' representatives as the new Office for Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p></reply>

When public sector organisations are within these ceilings there is scope for some recruitment and there has continued to be targeted recruitment to key posts and services particularly Health and Education.</p><p>  Given our fiscal position it is imperative that the public sector continues to reduce and control its costs, which necessarily involves maintaining a tight control on staffing levels.  We cannot afford to return to the 2008 peak staffing levels in the Irish public sector, nor is it sensible.  Through enhanced productivity and reform initiatives such as shared services we can achieve more effective, streamlined public services that delivers better value for money.</p></reply>

As can be seen from this update significant progress has been made in my Department.</p><p>The progress identified to date clearly shows that the Government has focused its attention on the decisions and reforms needed to achieve economic and financial stability, which provide a platform for economic recovery. My Department is determined to continue to implement our Programme for Government commitments &ndash; to restore the public's confidence in our economy and to achieve a strong and sustainable economy.</p><p>Many of the reforms in the Programme are ambitious and need careful sequencing and expertly executed delivery plans. Some may take the whole lifetime of the Government to complete.</p><p><pcenter><b>Programme for Government Commitments</b> <b>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</b>   <b>July 2013</b></pcenter></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Commitment</div></th><th><div>Current Status </div></th></tr><tr><td>We will draw up a new National Development Plan that reflects Ireland's changed economic circumstances, covering the seven-year period 2012-2019. The plan will be based on a comprehensive study of Ireland's public investment priorities over that period. </td><td>Completed - (A new NDP was not undertaken but the five year Exchequer capital framework was laid out in &#8220;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&#8221; published in November 2011. A new five year framework will be set out as the period of the current framework comes to a close.)</td></tr><tr><td>In the initial years, when resources will be most heavily constrained, we will prioritise investment in school building, non-national roads, healthcare, and in job-creation. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The new NDP will be based on traditional exchequer capital spending, plus other resources to be invested from the National Pension Reserve Fund, on the basis of obtaining a return on investment and that does not impact the Government Balance Sheet. </td><td>In Progress (no new NDP - see above - but there is a 5 year Exchequer framework and a new PPP programme)</td></tr><tr><td>In developing the new NDP, we will re-examine the investment programmes of the semi-state companies to ensure that they are in line with new economic circumstances. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>In order to ensure that public enterprise plays a full role in Ireland's economic recovery, we will create a holding company to manage the state's holdings of the semi-states, and to co-ordinate investment in key priority areas identified by the Government, including energy, water and forestry. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Over time, we also propose to finance the investment programme from the sale of certain state assets. We will target up to &euro;2 billion in sales of non-strategic state assets drawing from the recommendations of the McCarthy Review Group on State Assets when available. Assets will only be sold when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been established to protect consumer interests. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Re-prioritise capital funding for smaller projects that deal with specific immediate problems. Smaller projects are more labour intensive and more likely to be carried out by local contractors increasing short-run domestic economic impact. Investment priorities will include education, health and science and technology.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review to examine all areas of public spending and to assess effectiveness of spending programmes and value for company.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Accelerate capital works that are 'shovel ready' and labour intensive including schools and secondary roads.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will reform public procurement to become a tool to support innovative Irish firms and to allow greater access to Irish small and medium sized businesses. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce new legislation to protect all small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>A referendum to amend the Constitution to reverse the effects of the Abbeylara judgement to enable Oireachtas committees to carry out full investigations.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>A referendum to protect the right of citizens to communicate in confidence with public representatives.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>All appointments at Principal Officer level and above will be open to external competition and at least one-third of such appointments will be reserved for candidates from outside traditional civil service structures for a 5-year period. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Pin down accountability for results at every level of the public service - from Ministers down - with clear consequences for success and failure. Ministers will be responsible for policy and procurement and public service managers for delivery.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will report directly to Ministers and their Departments on performance against targets. </td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>Put in place a Whistleblowers Act to protect public servants that expose maladministration by Ministers or others, and restore Freedom of Information. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>There will be no more &#8220;golden handshakes&#8221; for public servants that have failed to deliver. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Overhaul TLAC (Top level Appointments Commission), with the chairperson and the majority of members drawn from outside the public sector. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce a reformed incentive system for all grades within core Government departments to reward cross-departmental teams that deliver audited improvements in service delivery and cost effectiveness. </td><td>Action required</td></tr><tr><td>Go beyond the recommendations of An Bord Snip to rationalise core processes that are duplicated across the public service, by establishing shared back-office operations for information technology, human resource management, payments and entitlement applications, business inspections and procurement. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Review the Local Government Efficiency Review as part of our Comprehensive Spending Review.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Make substantial cuts to the number of State bodies and companies.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Instigate a Government-wide review to identify and eliminate non-priority programmes and outsource, where appropriate, non-critical functions. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Rather than giving fixed budgets to traditional public service providers like the HSE, VECs and F&Aacute;S, we will put resources into the hands of citizens to acquire services that are tailored to better suit their needs and less expensive for the taxpayer.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Establish a new model of financing social interventions - called Social Impact Bonds - that share audited exchequer savings with charitable and voluntary organisations.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate we will open up the delivery of public services to a range of providers. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will give schools, hospitals and other public service bodies new freedoms - within strict budgets and new accountability systems - to set their own staffing needs, automate routine processes and adapt work practices to local staff and customer needs. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate for a reformulated code of laws, replacing both the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, which will spell out the legal relationship between Ministers and their civil servants and their legal accountability for decisions and for management of Departments.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>The system of implied general delegation of a Minister's statutory powers to civil servants will be abolished and replaced by a fixed and determined system of delegation of specified powers to specified officers. </td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>Where a responsibility is delegated through several civil service grades, each grade will be held accountable for their element of it and departmental officials giving evidence to Oireachtas committees will be obliged to speak on their own behalf for their delegated responsibilities and, where appropriate, defend themselves and their actions. </td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>Delegation orders will spell out the functions of the Minister in supervising the exercise of delegated powers: the Minister will be responsible for ensuring that adequate standards are maintained; outputs are delivered as determined or agreed; and procedures are in place to provide the Minister with the necessary and correct information to enable him or her to respond to problems of administration and to give an account of those problems, and of any necessary corrective action, to the D&aacute;il and to the public.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>We will bring to an end the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will review the grading structure of the civil service and public service and reduce number of management grades.<br /><br />Public service managers will be given greater autonomy in deciding how they use staffing budgets and resources to achieve agreed outcomes. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will remove barriers to mobility across the public service. As part of this we will create a new tier of senior public service management structures, where senior officials are rotated across the public sector to nurture the collaborative culture needed to tackle the biggest cross-cutting social and economic challenges. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>High level strategic goals will be reflected in individual goals, in a new performance management and development system for staff. <br /><br />Staff recognition schemes will be developed and devolved, with particular emphasis on team awards. Staff will be encouraged to put forward suggestions for improving service delivery and organisation efficiency and effectiveness. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Government services websites, public offices, telephone services, and helplines will be reconfigured to facilitate access to a broad range of government services through a single point of contact. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Ministers' salaries will be reduced, political expenses vouched for and severance payments for ministers axed.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>No political pensions will be paid to sitting TDs and in future no retired politician will get a political pension until the national retirement age. Politics must be about service to the public, not financial gain for politicians.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Amend the Constitution to Give D&aacute;il committees Full Powers of Investigation: The Abbeylara Supreme Court decision currently limits the ability of D&aacute;il committees to hold investigations into crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>A statutory duty on anybody established by or under statute, or with a majority ownership or funding by the State, to submit to the same parliamentary questions regime as applies to Government departments. This will involve a liability to provide answers to written questions within a specified number of D&aacute;il sitting days. (We will however recognise the special position of bodies with a commercial mandate operating at arm's length from Government). </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant (including political appointees) or Minister can work in the private sector in any area involving a potential conflict of interest with their former area of public employment, until at least two years have elapsed after they have left the public service.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>Restrictions on the nature and extent of evidence by civil servants to Oireachtas committees will be scrapped and replaced with new guidelines for civil servants that reflect the reality of the authority delegated to them and their personal accountability for the way in which it is exercised.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>The Committee would be the formal channel of consultation and collaboration between the Oireachtas and the Ombudsman, responsible for receiving and debating her annual and special reports and for ensuring that her criticisms and recommendations are acted upon. For that purpose, she would attend as a regular witness before the committee.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate to restore the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before it was undermined by the outgoing Government, and we will extend its remit to other public bodies including the administrative side of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, subject to security exceptions</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We intend to end the heavy dependence on a very limited pool of extremely expensive private solicitors firms providing legal services to the State and agencies, look at ways to require agencies to seek legal advice from the CSSO and not from the private sector in order to save costs, and ensure that legal work at the bar for the State is spread more equitably rather than confined to a very limited pool as at present. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will progress the Statute Law Revision Project in order to enhance public accessibility to the statute book.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will extend Freedom of Information, and the Ombudsman Act, to ensure that all statutory bodies, and all bodies significantly funded from the public purse, are covered.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce Whistleblowers legislation.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a statutory register of lobbyists, and rules concerning the practice of lobbying.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will abolish the additional pay for Ministers who leave office. We will restrict the payment of pensions to politicians so that in future a member can only qualify for a pension at the national retirement age (currently 65) and upon leaving public life. We will cap taxpayers' subsidies for all future pension schemes for politicians (and indeed for everybody) that deliver income in retirement of more than &euro;60,000.</td><td>Part Complete/Part in Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate and change D&aacute;il standing orders to ensure the absolute confidentiality of information entrusted to members of the D&aacute;il by their constituents or informants, and ensure that such information cannot be compulsorily disclosed through the legal process except with the consent of the informant.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Every public body will set out clear and unambiguous long, medium and short term strategic priorities, which will be clearly communicated to public service and citizens. Strategic priorities will be translated into high level goals for all Departments, on a 'whole of government' basis, and in consultation with Ministers. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Performance indicators will be identified to monitor progress on high level priorities. Annual reports of departments and agencies will include output statements and audited financial accounts prepared on generally accepted accounting principles. The performance information provided in output and outcome-focused measurement will feed into the decision making process for future plans at political and senior management level. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The reform process will provide for increased delegation of budgets, subject to detailed plans, relevant performance reporting and audited accounts compiled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Detailed business cases will be required for major projects, with review and reporting requirements built in to the plan. Sanctions will be imposed at an early stage for significant overruns. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will change the current emphasis on performance reporting to performance management. All medium to long-term projects that involve significant public spending will be subject to cost benefit analysis, and to on-going evaluation. The results of programme evaluations will be published and programmes not meeting their objectives will be wound down. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Performance and progress will be published in a new, audited annual Public Service Delivery Reports. Oireachtas Committees will expose any failure to hit milestones and targets. Each sectoral Committee will take on new powers, similar to those wielded by Public Accounts Committee, to hold Ministers and public servants to account for value for money. This will feed into Oireachtas consideration of the next Budget. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will be accountable directly to Ministers.</td><td>Action Required </td></tr><tr><td>We will bring forward the annual Estimates cycle, so that it becomes more timely and relevant. It will in future start at the beginning of the preceding year and conclude by the summer. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The annual Estimates will in future distinguish between monies being allocated to maintaining the existing level of service for existing programmes and money to support new programmes or policy decisions.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Book of Estimates will be accompanied by a detailed performance report on what the previous year's spending had achieved. It will also give details of the level of performance achieved by agencies under service delivery agreements with Government. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Oireachtas members will be given, from within existing resources, dedicated resources for the proper scrutiny of the Estimates. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will publish cost-benefit analyses for major infrastructure proposals and &#8220;tax expenditures&#8221; in advance of Government approval. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Public sector bodies will be required to publish balance sheets and to move to accruals from cash-flow accounting. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Every Purchase Order by a Government Department or agency for more than &euro;20,000 will be published online. We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General and Oireachtas Committees the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Public bodies will be required to openly compete for budget resources by publishing pre-budget spending requests, and what they would deliver in return for such allocations to help deliver Programme for Government. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) to examine all areas of public spending, based on the Canadian model, and to develop multi-annual budget plans with a three-year time horizon. This plan will be presented to the D&aacute;il for debate. It will assess effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes, and value for money.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The CSR will examine the number, range and activities of bodies funded significantly from public purse, including at local government level, and reduce numbers where appropriate. In future, when proposing a new agency, it will be necessary to prove that the proposed new functions cannot be carried out within the existing framework. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>We will, subject to there being no compulsory redundancies and to the protection of front line services: Reduce the total number of public sector employees by between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014, compared to the total number at the end of 2010. Reduce this number by a further 4,000 by 2015. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>We will extend the remit of Ombudsman to third level institutions.</td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>Review existing tendering processes for legal services by Government and State and semi-State agencies to ensure value for money and end anti-competitive practices. <br />The Government directed that a robust analysis be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na M&oacute;na to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors</td><td>In Progress<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In Progress</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Proposals for capital carryover are usually submitted to my Department as part of the normal Budget preparations and indicative figures for capital carryover are included in the Budget Estimates. The exact figure for capital carryover is confirmed in the Ministerial Order dealing with deferred surrender of unspent capital which must be made by me, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, no later than 31st March of the following year.</p><p>  The end June Exchequer returns showed that &euro;927m in capital was drawn down by Departments and Offices.  This is &euro;137m (12.9%) behind the level that had been profiled in the period. A variance of this order is not unusual and there can be variations in spending patterns between Departments with some ahead of target.  Departments have not indicated that they expect any significant savings by year end and so capital expenditure is expected to return to profile by then.</p><p>The Medium Term Expenditure Framework, which was first introduced in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 </i>proposed that carryover of unspent funds would also be allowed in the area of current expenditure.  Departments will now be permitted to carry over unspent current funds (including pay as appropriate) from one year to increase the current expenditure ceiling for the next year.  This will be subject to certain limits and safeguards and subject to my final approval.  A circular will be issued to all Departments detailing the operational arrangements for current carryover subject to the enactment of the <i>Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2013</i>  , which sets out the provision for multi-annual expenditure ceilings on a statutory footing.</p><p>  The end-June Exchequer returns showed that Departmental spending remains in line with profile to date with gross voted expenditure at &euro;25,187 million as at the end of June (1.2% or &euro;301 million below profile).</p></reply>

It sets the overall capital investment framework and the basic principles to be observed for the appraisal, assessment, procurement and evaluation of projects. It does not have a direct role in delivering individual projects (either PPP or traditional Exchequer capital projects). This is primarily the responsibility of the Sponsoring Department/Agency. </p><p>  In accordance with the guidance issued by my Department, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) has the role of providing an opinion to the Sponsoring Agency (Dublin City Council) in relation to the value for money testing on a PPP project. In essence, the NDFA role in this project boils down to comparing the Net Present Value (&ldquo;NPV&rdquo;) of the private sector bid with the NPV of the agreed benchmark. The Value for Money assessment will be completed internally by the NDFA on receipt of all required documentation, and without the use of consultants. Careful consideration of all aspects of a project including costs, benefits and financing, before significant commitments are entered into, represents value for money and accords with best practice.</p></reply>

Universal access to the sunken pool and grassed areas was not provided.</p><p>  As part of the planning application submitted to Dublin City Council in October 2012 for the proposed &lsquo;Journey of light Memorial&rsquo; to the Victims of Abuse in Institutions to be located at the western end of the Garden of Remembrance, an accessibility appraisal, which took into account the existing layout of the Garden, was carried out and submitted to Dublin City Council in November 2012. Planning permission for the proposed Memorial was granted on 19th May, 2013. However this was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the 6th June 2013 deadline and a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected by 8th October 2013. </p><p>  If approved, the Journey of Light Memorial project will address the majority of accessibility issues including the sunken pool area. Universal access to the main plinth area, where the Children of Lir statue is located, will then be the outstanding issue and it is hoped to address this in due course, mindful that any proposed interventions will have to have regard to the uniqueness and status of the Garden.</p></reply>

Under this system, the prescribed accountancy bodies are responsible for regulating their members. </p><p>  A prescribed accountancy body is one that comes under the supervisory remit of IAASA and there are nine prescribed bodies in Ireland as follows: ACCA - Association of Chartered Certified Accountants;  AIA - Association of International Accountants; CIMA - Chartered Institute of Management Accountants; CIPFA - Chartered Institute of Public Finance &amp;amp; Accountancy; ICAEW - Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp;amp; Wales; ICAI - Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland; ICAS - Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland; ICPAI - Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland; IIPA - Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants. </p><p>  The role of IAASA is to supervise the manner in which the accountancy bodies perform their regulatory functions and if necessary take appropriate action to ensure that the accountancy bodies are fully adhering to their own approved regulations and procedures.</p></reply>

The report recommended the alignment of the majority share of competitive State funding in research and innovation for the next five years with the 14 areas of opportunity identified by the Steering Group. The areas, which include sectors such as food, health, ICT, manufacturing, energy, and innovation in services and business processes, were identified on the basis of existing strengths of the enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact, and jobs. </p><p>  Following publication of the report in March 2012, the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG) was established, under my chairmanship, to drive implementation of research prioritisation, and it includes representatives of all research funders and relevant Government Departments. A number of working groups were then established by the PAG and charged with developing Action Plans for each of the Priority Areas. Each Action Plan was validated through a process of external stakeholder engagement which involved researchers and industry in the relevant areas and publication of the Action Plans was recently approved by Government. The Action Plans represent the detailed blueprint for actions to be taken by funding Departments and funding agencies to re-align the majority of competitive public research funding around the priority areas over the next five years. </p><p>  A Framework of Metrics and Targets for Monitoring the Impact of Science Technology and Innovation (STI) Investment has also been approved for publication. The Framework of metrics and targets will firstly monitor the impact of public STI investment, and, secondly, monitor the impact of the implementation of Research Prioritisation on the 14 Priority Areas. The purpose of setting these targets is twofold; to stretch the public enterprise support system in order to maximise the impact of public investment in R&amp;amp;D; and to assess the success over time of the implementation of Research Prioritisation. </p><p>  Implementation of Research Prioritisation is very much the Government&rsquo;s priority STI goal and a key pillar of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is &lsquo;Using Research and Innovation to Drive Job Creation&rsquo;. Building on success to date, I am looking forward to continued implementation of the Research Prioritisation exercise, as we seek to enhance the effect and impact of our research investment in order to deliver high quality, sustainable jobs.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, the enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department, in conjunction with the relevant City and County Enterprise Boards, support enterprise development in the regions. The Government is committed to delivering national recovery and economic development, and the role local authorities play in promoting this at a local level is essential to the overall national effort.  The sustainability of our regions will be significantly shaped by interaction with the international economy - in terms of investment, tourism and the growth of indigenous businesses.</p><p>  In the European context, the European Union is putting clear emphasis on policies that will return us to growth and create more and better jobs.  Encouraging and supporting regional excellence in innovation is a key component of ensuring that European regions continue to flourish.  The European Union plays an essential role in giving researchers from every corner of the EU the opportunity to develop their competences and to find suitable partners to collaborate with.</p><p>  The theme of the recently concluded Irish EU Presidency was Stability, Growth and Jobs.  Growth is increasingly related to the capacity of regional economies to change and innovate.  Regions and cities have become the primary spatial units where knowledge is transferred, innovation systems are built and competition to attract investments and talents takes place.</p><p>  The purpose of the WIRE 2013 conference, which was organised by Enterprise Ireland and the European Commission, was to contribute to regional policy development in the areas of research, innovation and learning at both European and regional level.  The occasion of the conference was used to enhance policy formation for effective regional development. </p><p>  There were four central themes which will form the basis for the Declaration:</p><p> -  C - COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</p><p> -  O - OUTWARD LOOKING</p><p> -  R - REGIONAL DIMENSION</p><p> -  K - KNOWLEDGE</p><p>  The conclusions of the conference will form the basis of a 'Cork Declaration', this will be used as formal input by Ireland's Presidency of the EU, to the Competitiveness Council and will be circulated to leading European regional representative organisations and communities, forming a key output of the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

In this context, together with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Social Protection, I launched the JobsPlus initiative last week.  This is a new employer incentive scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection which will incentivise businesses to hire jobseekers from the Live Register, boost job creation and reduce long-term unemployment. Much of the application and approval process for JobsPlus will be completed online at .</p><p>  In terms of job creation in Cavan and Monaghan, Enterprise Ireland's (EI) activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies (HPSU), the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and Third Level institutions.  EI provides a range of supports for start-ups including: the Competitive Feasibility Fund for the North East Region (Cavan, Monaghan and Louth) launched in February 2013; the Competitive Start-Up Fund, the Seed and Venture Capital and Development Capital Fund; the HALO Business Angel Partnership Programme that is mandated to match business angels to appropriate projects; the New Frontiers Programme and the Innovation Voucher Initiative.</p><p>  EI has 99 client companies in County Cavan employing in excess of 4,000 people. To date in 2013, over &euro;621,000 has been approved to Cavan companies and &euro;420,000 paid.  In County Monaghan, Enterprise Ireland has 124 client companies employing almost 3,500 people. To date in 2013, over &euro;1.4m has been approved to Monaghan companies and &euro;599,000 paid.</p><p>  The Cavan and Monaghan County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) support the micro-enterprise sector at local level. Support is available, subject to certain criteria, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level, with priority being given to manufacturing and internationally traded services.  In 2012, Cavan CEB paid out &euro;234,185 to 20 projects and 477 people availed of Cavan CEB Training Programmes.  To date in 2013, Cavan CEB has approved &euro;234,500 in grant aid to 10 projects with the potential to create 47 full time and 16 part time jobs.  In 2012, Monaghan CEB paid out &euro;258,522 to 14 projects and 648 people availed of Monaghan CEB Training Programmes. To date in 2013, Monaghan CEB has approved grant aid of &euro;171,220 to 6 start-up and developing companies with an expected job creation figure of 15.  </p><p>  Recent initiatives organised by these two CEBs to address job losses in the region, include:</p><p> -  A &euro;3.064m project funded by the Special EU Programmes Body under the INTERREG IVA Programme entitled &#8220;Harnessing Natural Resources&#8221;. Overall, it is estimated that the project will result in the creation of up to 100 jobs.</p><p> -  An Information Event in Castleblayney, inviting all relevant agencies to come together under one roof to provide information and support to the unemployed.  </p><p>  The Government also established a Microfinance Loan Fund in 2012, to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses. This is particularly relevant to entrepreneurs who don't have a track record in credit history, previous business experience, other assets to act as security etc. which financial institutions typically seek. </p><p>  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA has invested in the provision of an extensive portfolio of property solutions in the North East Region which enhances its marketability for potential FDI opportunities. IDA will consider all opportunities to leverage its property portfolio in smaller population centres like Cavan and Monaghan in order to facilitate investment generation and job creation from the indigenous and non-traditional sectors of the economy. </p></reply>

I have, accordingly, raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations.  That having been said, however, locations outside of Dublin and the main urban centres already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA is from the existing client base. </p><p>  In order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment, an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014 is currently being undertaken. This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our approach to regional development</p></reply>

Regional Aid, also known as investment aid, is paid in the form of grants by the industrial development agencies to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Europe's most disadvantaged regions.  Such aid must be in accordance with each countries Regional Aid Map, as approved by the European Commission, which has responsibility for the Regional Aid Guidelines. </p><p>  The new guidelines will enter into force on 1 July 2014. As a result, the current guidelines that were due to expire at the end of this year are to be extended for six month transition period.  For the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Map Ireland&rsquo;s population coverage will rise from 50%  to 51.28%. This is due to the overall share of regions where regional aid can be granted increasing from the current level of 46.1% to 47.2 % of the EU population. This means that enhanced investment grants can be paid to companies in the least economically developed regions of Ireland. </p><p>  A revised Irish Regional Aid Map will have to be submitted to and approved by the Commission before the end of June 2014. For the 2014-2020 Irish Regional Aid Map, economic data such as unemployment and Gross Domestic Product for all counties, including those counties in the BMW Region, will once again be analysed afresh when deciding which counties will be designated for Regional Aid.  During the Regional Aid Guideline process thus far, my Department has consulted relevant stakeholders including various Government Departments, the industrial development agencies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forf&aacute;s, the Central Statistics Office, the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, and the eight Regional Authorities.  Further consultation will now take place with the above bodies and other relevant stakeholders. The deadline for the submission of the Irish map has yet to be communicated by the Commission. </p></reply>

In 2012, Enterprise Ireland established the Potential Exporters Division. Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating growth potential from the domestic to the international marketplace. </td></tr><tr><td>1.4.3 A 'Source Ireland' portal will be developed to market Irish goods and services abroad.<br /><br />Commitment met</td><td>A 'Source Ireland' portal has been developed to market Irish goods and services abroad. </td></tr><tr><td>1.5.2 We will support our indigenous digital game industry by reforming R&amp;amp;D supports available to the industry, setting aside funding from Innovation Fund Ireland for a seed capital scheme for Irish digital gaming start-ups, introduce a digital media component to Transition Year programmes and promote Ireland as digital gaming hub </td><td>The Department is currently working with the Digital Games Clustering Development Team for the purpose of assessing the suitability of the existing R&amp;amp;D tax Credit to the digital games sector. The Department is also assessing the case for a new financial instrument/relief to incentivise creative content development in the games sector. The intention is to complete this assessment in the timeframe for Budget 2014.<br /><br />Enterprise Ireland has confirmed that a number of the existing venture capital funds, along with those new funds coming on stream, have and will continue to invest in a range of software related projects including businesses in the digital game space. <br /><br />EI's Competitive Start Fund (&euro;50K Equity) has had a significant impact on the early stage indigenous games sector since December 2010. Over this period, EI has completed 10 calls and has funded 16 Games companies. <br /><br />In addition Enterprise Ireland and the National Pensions Reserve Fund have made available up to &euro;250m  in equal amounts to attract investment by international venture capital funds in Ireland under the Innovation Fund Ireland .  <br /><br />The Department of Education and Skills has explained that schools design their own programmes for TY and, consequently, may be providing courses that address digital media. </td></tr><tr><td>1.5.5 We will develop a National Intellectual Property (IP) protocol to give predictability about the terms on which business can access IP created in Higher Education Institutions and the wider digital sector</td><td>The IP Protocol was published in June 2012, the purpose of which is to help the enterprise sector to access the research done in Ireland's universities, institutes of technology and other public research institutions.<br /><br />A key recommendation of the report centres around the establishment of a 'central Technology Transfer Office' to provide an effective interface between industry and the research community and to drive a world class technology transfer system in Ireland, ensuring it is responsive to the needs of both industry and academia.<br /><br />The recruitment of the Director of the cTTO is nearing completion and support staff for the cTTO are in place.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.6 We will promote and support investment in technology research, development and commercialisation beyond basic research supported by Science Foundation Ireland, as well as removing barriers to innovation and accelerate exploitation of new technologies. </td><td>The IP Protocol, referred to above, will support both industry parties and research performing organisations in making their commercial negotiations on the exploitation of new technologies and ideas faster, more consistent and more transparent</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.7 We will target key technology areas and sectors where innovation can be applied including but not limited to high value manufacturing, advanced materials, nanotechnology, bioscience, electronics, photonics and electrical systems and information and communication technology. </td><td>The report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group recommended 14 areas of opportunity as well as underpinning technologies and infrastructure to support these priority areas which should receive the majority of competitive public investment in STI over the coming 5 years. <br /><br />Following publication of the report on 1st March 2012, the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG) was established, under the chairmanship and political leadership of the Minister for Research and Innovation Sean Sherlock TD, to drive implementation of research prioritisation under the broader authority of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs. Action Plans to drive implementation have been developed for each priority area and were approved by Government in June 2013. The PAG will oversee implementation of these Action Plans. <br /><br />A detailed Framework of Metrics and Targets has been drawn up as part of Research Prioritisation to measure the outputs and impact of funding provided, which will comprehend all of the 14 Action Plans for the respective Priority Areas, and this too was approved by Government in June 2013. </td></tr><tr><td>1.5.8 We will also focus on the application of technological innovation in established sectors of the economy like energy generation and supply, transport, creative industries, high-value services and architecture and construction by identifying challenges, establishing priorities and developing strategies which specify necessary actions to transition to more innovative approach.</td><td>See 1.5.7 above in relation to Research Prioritisation</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.9 We will promote Ireland's full engagement with the 'Innovative Union' proposals issued by the European Commission in October 2010 as one of the seven flagship initiatives under EU2020 Strategy, with the specific aim of refocusing R&amp;amp;D and innovation policy on major challenges and at turning inventions into products.</td><td>The Irish EU Presidency completed negotiations on a political agreement on Horizon 2020, the next EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation which will focus EU research funding from 2014-2020 on major societal challenges. <br /><br /><br /><br />The Irish EU Presidency also focused on measures to progress the European Research Area, a key component of Innovation Union.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ireland will continue to engage fully with initiatives proposed by the European commission in support of the Innovation Union strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.10 We will establish a network of Technology Research Centres focused on applied technological research in specific areas, to be linked to appropriate higher-education institutions. The centres will accelerate exploitation of new technologies by providing infrastructure that bridges gap between research and technology commercialisation. We will initially establish 3 additional centres focusing on biotechnology, nanotechnology and high value manufacturing. Further centres from a number of other areas will be selected at a later time. </td><td>The Irish EU Presidency completed negotiations on a political agreement on Horizon 2020, the next EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation which will focus EU research funding from 2014-2020 on major societal challenges. <br /><br /><br /><br />The Irish EU Presidency also focused on measures to progress the European Research Area, a key component of Innovation Union.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ireland will continue to engage fully with initiatives proposed by the European commission in support of the Innovation Union strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.11 We will support the development of an International Content Services Centre to make Ireland world leader in managing intellectual property.  </td><td>The Department commissioned a Feasibility Study as part of the deliberative process around this proposal. The study was finalised in January 2013 and  following consideration, proposals will be developed  regarding the next steps to be taken resulting from the findings of the study</td></tr><tr><td>1.5.12 We will pioneer within the EU a model of 'fair use' in European Copyright Law, like in the USA, which effectively permits the use of portions of a copyrighted work so long as the normal economic exploitation of the originating work is not undermined. This will allow internet companies and other digital innovators to bring their services to market. </td><td>The US style &#8220;fair use&#8221; doctrine is being examined as part of the on- going  review of copyright legislation by the Independent Copyright Review Committee, in accordance with  its Terms of  Reference .   On completion of the Report, and following consideration of the recommendations, a recommendation regarding introduction of the doctrine will be made to Government. </td></tr><tr><td>1.6.3 We will reform the Joint Labour Committee structure, beginning with the appointment of independent chairpersons to JLCs, who will retain a casting vote. Reform options will examine the rate of pay for atypical hours. </td><td>Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 came into effect on 1st August 2012*. The Act provided for a reform of the statutory wage setting mechanisms (JLCs and REAs), <br /><br /><br /><br />Review of the existing JLCs was carried out by the Labour Court and presented to the Minister. The Minister intends to publish the Review along with his proposals shortly. <br /><br /><br /><br />*The Supreme Court judgment of May 9th 2013 in the case of McGowan and others,  Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 to be unconstitutional thereby invalidating the registration of all REAs that were previously registered under the 1946 Act. <br /><br />Minister has announced his intention to put in place, as soon as possible, legislation that will be fully informed by the Supreme Court judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>1.6.6 We will reduce the cost of Government imposed red-tape on business, in part by streamlining regulatory enforcement activities out of a merger and rationalisation of existing structures. We will create a Business Inspection and Licensing Authority that absorbs the existing business inspection activities of the Health and Safety Authority, and the National Consumer Agency. </td><td>Significant progress has been made with a reduction in administrative burdens of 25% achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp;amp; Safety Law; this amounts to potential annual savings for business of almost  &euro;208m  million.My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target.    The current estimated overall reduction is 19% which includes the 25% achieved by my Department, and the Revenue Commissioners  and 30% achieved by the Central Statistics Office. The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services will deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court.<br /><br />This proposal developed into a wider consideration of new measures to assist small businesses in their compliance with licensing and regulation, e.g. the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority (HSA) developed and launched a single licensing portal for occupational health &amp;amp; safety and chemicals licensing requirements. See <br /><br />The HSA also developed &#8220;BeSMART&#8221; - a free online tool  developed to help reduce costs for and the administrative burden on small business of meeting their legal obligations to prepare Risk Assessments and a Safety Statement under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 .  Current estimates put potential savings for the SME sector as a whole in the region of &euro;60-&euro;65m. See </td></tr><tr><td>1.6.8 We will develop a Unique Business Identifier for use by all government departments and agencies that will facilitate the sharing of information within Government and reduce repetitive information requests from businesses. </td><td>This will be considered in the context of legislation to facilitate data sharing</td></tr><tr><td>1.6.10 We will introduce new legally binding voluntary commercial debt plan structures to allow small businesses to restructure debts without recourse to expensive court procedures. </td><td>The Company Law Review Group made recommendations in September 2012. Some of these recommendations are being implemented in the Companies Bill 2012, which has begun its enactment process. The remaining recommendations are to be the subject of further consideration by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation in consultation with the Minister for Justice and are to take account of the experience of the new Insolvency Service of Ireland.</td></tr><tr><td>1.7.1 We will implement a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme that will provide a level of insurance to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks' lending again to industry and entrepreneurs. <br /><br />Commitment met</td><td>Fully implemented in Oct 2012</td></tr><tr><td>1.7.2 We will construct a &euro;100 million Microfinance Start-Up Fund that will provide start-up loans and equity that draws funding from the NPRF and private institutional funds. <br /><br />Commitment met</td><td>Fully implemented in Oct 2012</td></tr><tr><td>1.7.3 We will support the development of a more dynamic, venture capital industry in Ireland by seeking to attract top tier venture financing and investment companies to Ireland, such as Silicon Valley Bank. <br /><br />Commitment met</td><td>To date, under the IFI scheme four international venture capital funds have established a presence in the Ireland market. A further numbers of investments are in the pipeline. <br /><br /><br /><br />Furthermore, following a separate initiative by the NPRF Silicon Valley Bank is set to deploy US$100 million of new lending commitments to fast-growing Irish technology, life science, cleantech, private equity and venture capital businesses over five years, subject to its usual lending criteria.</td></tr><tr><td>1.7.4 We will work to promote a greater appreciation of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation, ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities, and provide a conductive framework for the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised, including in areas such as childcare, education, housing, energy retrofitting, environmental protection, transport and healthcare. </td><td>Legislation has been drafted to facilitate this commitment.<br /><br /><br /><br />This commitment goes across a number of Departments.</td></tr><tr><td>1.8.7 We will legislate to ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector, such as 'hello money' from food suppliers. </td><td>Publication of Bill expected in Q3/Q4 2013</td></tr><tr><td>1.8.25 We will seek to establish Ireland as a renewable manufacturing hub to attract international and domestic investment. </td><td>In November 2012, the Government published a Policy Statement on Growth and Employment in the Green Economy which has the objective of attracting investment in the Green Economy in Ireland.  A Consultative Committee on Jobs in the Green Economy has also been established to identify emerging opportunities for Ireland in the Green Economy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.9.1 The Government will promote the development of a vibrant and effective social enterprise sector. We will instruct agencies to view social enterprises as important stakeholders in rejuvenating local economies. We will continue support for social innovation projects for young people trough (sic) education, community and voluntary structures. </td><td>Forfas prepared a Report on the potential of the Social Enterprise Sector in Ireland.  The report highlights the fact that social enterprises cover a wide spectrum of activity and are currently supported by a number of Departments and agencies.  The Forfas Report will be submitted to Government, prior to publication.</td></tr><tr><td>2.3.19 We will make good corporate governance the law, not an optional extra, and enact legislation to provide for binding code of practice for corporate governance, which will be obligatory for companies wishing to be listed on Irish stock exchange.<br /><br />Commitment met</td><td>Companies that wish to list on the main market of the Irish Stock Exchange must comply by law with the UK's Corporate Governance Code and the Irish Annex.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2.10.4 We will strengthen corporate governance legislation and enforcement.</td><td>The Companies Bill 2012 replicates the provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act 2009 which granted additional powers to the ODCE to assist with enforcing Company Law.  Additionally the Bill categorises and clarifies all offences under Company Law.  As a result of the categorisation of offences and the introduction of uniform maximum fines and terms of imprisonment, a number of existing offences will carry higher penalties under the Bill. The Companies Bill 2012 has completed  Second Stage in the D&aacute;il</td></tr><tr><td>3.41.6 We will reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights.</td><td>Consultation  process initiated December 2012. Written submissions received from stakeholders. Follow up meetings held. <br /><br />Legislative proposals to be presented to Cabinet in Q4 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>4.13.5 We will review and update Intellectual Property legislation currently in place to benefit innovation, develop a National Intellectual Property protocol to give clarity about terms on which business can access IP created in Higher Education Institutions, and clarify legislation relating to online copyright infringement and enforcement of rights relating to digital communications.</td><td>Re IP protocol- see 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 above<br /><br />The independent  Copyright Review Committee is , in accordance with  its Terms of  Reference , examining  the current Copyright legislative framework to identify any areas of the legislation that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation and will  make recommendations to resolve any problems identified (see ref. 1.5.12 above); Re: IP Protocol -see 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 above;  Re: clarification of  legislation relating  to copyright infringement and enforcement:   the European Union (Copyright and  Related Rights) Regulations came  into force in February 2012, clarifying that an  injunction may be sought against intermediaries whose services are being  used by third parties to infringe a copyright or related right.</td></tr><tr><td>4.15.3 We will enact the Fair Trade Act, which will ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector such as 'hello money' which suppliers have to pay to secure a place for their goods on supermarket shelves. </td><td>Publication of Bill expected in Q3/Q4 2013</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In response to this Green Paper, my Department submitted a copy of the report of the facilitator appointed in 2010 to explore, with the relevant stakeholders, the possibilities of achieving agreement on a Voluntary Code of Practice for Grocery Goods Undertakings. This report is available on my Department's website at www.djei.ie/publications/commerce/2011/reportgrocerycodemay11.pdf.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact legislation to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector. I intend to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the Consumer and Competition Bill. This Bill will also, <i>inter alia, </i>merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, update and reform competition law on foot of a review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002 and give effect to the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers.  Work on drafting the Consumer and Competition Bill is on-going and the Bill is included in the &quot;A list&quot; in the Government's current Legislative Programme.</p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it is important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy. The introduction of a Code of Practice is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p></reply>

Up to 2003, productivity in the manufacturing sector grew by between 4 per cent and 8 per cent per year. Since 2003, annual productivity growth has slowed to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent. This decline mirrors a similar trend in the sector in most of the developed world.  However, productivity in manufacturing has been increasing over recent years. Annual average growth rates in per hour labour productivity across manufacturing sectors amounted to 5.6 per cent over the period 2007 to 2010 enhancing the competitiveness of Ireland's firms on international markets. In 2012 goods exports increased by 1% over 2011, reaching a total of &euro;92bn, the highest figure since 2002.  </p><p>  In terms of employment, 50,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing in 2008-2010.  However, numbers have stabilised over the last two years and there are now 205,700 people directly employed in manufacturing (both full-time and part-time), and a similar number of people employed indirectly.</p><p>  Forfas recently produced a very thorough analysis of manufacturing in Ireland today - <i>Manufacturing to 2020</i>.  This Strategy contains a number of key recommendations for the development of the manufacturing sector which my Department, along with a Manufacturing Development Forum comprised of industry representatives, are currently implementing. It is clear from Forfas' report that firms in the sector need to reposition themselves, to invest in identifying new market opportunities, to enhance their productivity and build innovative capacity so that they remain competitive and relevant to their existing and potential customers. To achieve these aims, a National Step Change initiative is needed that will assist Ireland's manufacturing sector move to the forefront internationally and to improve competitiveness, productivity and innovation. This will also involve Government putting the right initiatives in place and opening up existing agency programmes - that have a proven track record - to FDI manufacturing firms e.g. Enterprise Ireland's <i>Lean</i>.  Work in this area is already underway.</p><p>  Forfas' Manufacturing Strategy does not contain a comparative analysis with the same sector in Northern Ireland. However, the NI Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment produced a report in March 2006 - <i>The Future of Manufacturing in Northern Ireland</i>  - which observed that there was over &pound;4.5 billion of manufacturing exports sales in Northern Ireland in 2004/05; that 12.5% of total direct employment in Northern Ireland was in manufacturing, and that the sector generated almost 30% of the total economic activity of Northern Ireland businesses.  I am confident that the recommendations in Forfas' Manufacturing Strategy's will assist Government Departments and agencies with the important tasks facing Ireland's manufacturing sector.</p></reply>

Enterprise Board statistics are collated on an annual basis and figures in respect of 2013 will not be available until the first quarter of 2014.  In 2012, Waterford City Enterprise Board paid out funding of &euro;316,507 to 21 projects and Waterford County Enterprise Board paid out &euro;267,248 to 21 projects.  These projects include start-up and established microenterprises.  Between 2012 and to date in 2013, Enterprise Ireland has approved over &euro;260,000 in Feasibility funding to 12 separate start-up projects based in Waterford.  In addition, four Waterford based companies, first supported as HPSU's in 2011 were approved follow-on funding between 2012 and 2013, totalling &euro;4 million.  </p><p>  To date, Enterprise Ireland has provided over &euro;2.5 million in capital funding to ArcLabs in the Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), under its regional innovation strategy and continues to work with WIT to ensure the potential of emerging companies is maximised.  Enterprise Ireland also works in partnership with WIT under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s New Frontiers Programme. Under the 2012 Programme, 9 entrepreneurs are being incubated in WIT and provided with funding of &euro;15,000 each over a six month period.

In addition, Sanofi announced that it will invest &euro;44m in its Waterford site.  </p><p>  The South East Employment Action Plan has a number of recommendations which the relevant agencies and stakeholders are charged with implementing and work is on-going with agencies and stakeholders working together to maximise benefits for the region.

The policy lays out clear guidelines for staff in relation to modes of transport and hotels and accommodation that may procured. The work undertaken on overseas travel feeds into the business process for which the travel was undertaken, a specific report is not prepared on each travel itinerary.  The relevant Budget Manager approves travel itineraries in advance and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s contracted travel agent will then look for the most competitive and appropriate travel options.

This year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2013 will build on the success of the 2012 Action Plan.  It includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies or Offices.  The Plan contains a range of policy actions to assist the development of indigenous enterprise.  Employment retention and creation continues to be our primary objective in 2013.  I am confident that the structure that we have created will deliver the type of actions needed to support the transition in our economy to sustainable growth.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activity in County Kerry is focussed primarily on the development of companies export potential and in the creation of new jobs; through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new High Potential Start-Up Companies; on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies through support of company development and export plans.  Enterprise Ireland also supports Research &amp;amp; Development in companies, and through collaboration with relevant Third Level institutions at a national, regional and county level. In County Kerry, this is primarily delivered in collaboration with Institute of Technology Tralee.  Funding of up to &euro;3m for the Institute of Technology Tralee was announced this year by Enterprise Ireland.  The funding includes &euro;1.4m for Shannon ABC (Applied Biotechnology Centre), an industry focussed Research, Development and Innovation Centre that is a collaborative response from the IT Tralee and Limerick IT to the needs of business. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland works with approximately 125 client companies employing in excess of 3,500 in County Kerry.   Enterprise Ireland has a number of supports and initiatives in place to assist these companies, depending on their stage of development.  In relation to the development of a strong pipeline of high potential start-ups, Enterprise Ireland has the New Frontiers Programme, Ireland&rsquo;s national entrepreneurial development programme, in IT Tralee which commenced in June 2013 with 10 participants. The purpose of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets and companies in County Kerry have been very successful in securing funding of &euro;50,000 from the Fund.</p><p>  In encouraging foreign direct investment to County Kerry, IDA Ireland promotes the county as part of the South West Region.  IDA also endorses and supports the initiatives driven under the &ldquo;Succeed in Ireland&rdquo; agenda which engages key stakeholders in the regions regarding opportunities for investment.  IDA Ireland continues to compete for high quality investments at the higher end of the value chain. At the end of 2012, there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in County Kerry with total employment of circa 1,600 people.</p><p>  The Kerry County Enterprise Board (CEB) provides a source of support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, promotes and develops indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulates economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level through both financial and non-financial assistance to project promoters. Job creation and retention are inherent considerations in the Board&rsquo;s activities as it continues to engage and work with potential businesses on an on-going basis with strong referral to sister agencies.  In 2012, the Board paid out &euro;253,502 to 39 project promoters and 871 people participated in the Board&rsquo;s Training Programmes.</p></reply>

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. </p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   </p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.   State pension transition was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension.  It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.   </p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65 who are unable to remain in the workforce, the main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).    </p><p>  Consideration is underway on reviewing the needs of older workers who wish to work longer and in terms of the supports available within the social welfare system.  </p><p>  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.</p></reply>

In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie</i>  .  In 2013 funding of some &euro;19 million has been provided to MABS.</p><p>Information and immediate support on all aspects of money management and personal debt is available from the MABS Helpline. In many cases the Helpline can provide the help and support people need. However, if a caller needs to avail of the face-to-face service provided by a MABS Money Adviser, they will be directed to a local MABS office.</p><p>MABS operate an appointment scheduling system and this means that in some cases clients may have to wait a number of weeks for the next available appointment. While waiting for an appointment, clients can use MABS free self-help materials to take holding action and to begin the process of assessing their situation.  The MABS Helpline can also support clients while they are awaiting their first appointment with a MABS money adviser.</p><p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has responsibility for MABS, compiles information on the waiting times in each MABS office on a quarterly basis and posts it to the <i>www.mabs.ie</i>  website.  The most recent statistics available, compiled to end of June 2013, record that the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser is some 4.4 weeks. This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.  Details are provided by county / office area in the table below.</p><p>Over half of  MABS services have a waiting time of 4 weeks or less, 13  MABS services have a waiting time of above 4 weeks but no more than 6 weeks and eight have a waiting time greater than 6 weeks. MABS has dealt with over 2,000 Emergency clients since the beginning of the year.  These clients are seen immediately without any waiting period.  MABS is currently working with over 24,000 clients.</p><p>I am satisfied that MABS provides a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p><p><b>Client Waiting Times and Numbers at 30 June 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>MABS Company</th><th>Waiting  time Average</th><th>Number awaiting first appointment</th></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Weeks</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Arklow &amp;amp; District</td><td>2.4</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>1.6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun</td><td>5.4</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>5.8</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Bray</td><td>1.6</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>5.4</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>2.4</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Charleville</td><td>2.8</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>4</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>4.2</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>2.8</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>2.8</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal North</td><td>20.2</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal South</td><td>6.2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Drogheda</td><td>5.6</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 10 + 20 (Comac)</td><td>1.8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 12 Area</td><td>3.2</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City</td><td>6</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North East</td><td>7.4</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East</td><td>1.8</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>4.4</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Dun na nGall Iarthar (Derrybeg)</td><td>2.2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>0.8</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Dundrum/Rathfarnham</td><td>4.4</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>5.8</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas Cabra</td><td>2</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Galway North</td><td>5</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Galway South</td><td>6</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2.4</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>6.8</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1.8</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>3.8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Liffey South West</td><td>2.6</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>7</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>2.2</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo North</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo South</td><td>16</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>13.6</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>4.2</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Mullingar</td><td>1.2</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>8.6</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>4.6</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>4</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>3.2</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North</td><td>3.2</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South</td><td>1.6</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>0.8</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford West</td><td>0.6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1.2</td><td>12</td></tr></table></p></reply>

If a person does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance. In 2012, my Department spent over &euro;738m on the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme and at the end of 2012 there were some 85,000 recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. For the same period my Department spent &euro;3.05 billion on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme and at the end of 2012 there were 294,000 recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  </p><p>  Where an employee is put on short time working by their employer they may be entitled to the Systematic Short Time Scheme. Under this scheme the number of days an individual is working has been reduced systematically each week so that they are now working less than the normal working week in the employment concerned. For the days a person is not working they may be entitled to a social welfare payment. </p><p>  In order to qualify for this scheme short-time working must be systematic in that there must be a clear repetitive pattern of employment each week. Persons temporarily laid off are not classified as short-time but may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit subject to the same conditions as any other worker.</p><p>  The main changes to the jobseeker schemes that affect workers on short time or those who have been temporarily laid off since 2011 are as follows:</p><p>-  Budget 2012 provided for a change in payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Where a benefit recipient is working part-time or in casual employment their benefit entitlement is now calculated with reference to a 5 day, rather than a 6 day, week. This measure does not impact on the systematic short-time scheme, which has always been based on a 5 day working week.</p><p>-  Budget 2012 also provided that Sunday working is now taken into account when calculating the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to be paid. This measure only impacts where a recipient works on a Sunday.</p><p>-  Budget 2013 provided that, from April, 2013, the duration for which jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is paid will be reduced from 12 months to 9 months for recipients with 260 or more contributions paid and from 9 months to 6 months for recipients with less than 260 contributions paid. This measure may reduce the duration of benefit to which a short-time worker will be entitled.</p></reply>

It will manage as much as possible means testing for State entitlements. It will also be responsible for employment referral and training supports provided by F&Aacute;S.

There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41 as mentioned above; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently under way in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.  </p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  The improvement has continued in 2013 with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so that people can continue living at home as long as possible &ndash; in fact the supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer's allowance; &euro;24 million on carer's benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million. </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer's allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  A person in receipt of certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person may qualify for a half-rate carer's allowance while retaining their main social welfare payment.   </p><p>  Regrettably, I am not in a position to reverse last year's cut in the respite care grant.  However, I should point out that both the Carers' Association and Care Alliance Ireland have made submissions to my Department in the context of Budget 2014, and representatives from both organisations attended the pre-Budget Forum which I hosted on July 5 last. The key points made by both organisations will be considered in the context of framing Budget 2014.</p></reply>

A key element of this is the active policing of the black economy sector where there is a prevalence of social welfare fraud and tax non-compliance.</p><p>  A range of specific activities are being undertaken to ensure that the black economy is appropriately targeted.  These include:</p><p><i>- Interagency co-operation</i> : In conjunction with other agencies and, in particular, with Revenue, the Department tackles shadow economy working by a combination of joint intelligence collation, assurance checks and outdoor operations, including inspections and direct investigations. </p><p><i>- High Level DSP/Revenue co-operation:</i> The Department liaises bilaterally with Revenue through a High Level Group consisting of senior officials from both organisations.  This mechanism ensures on-going collaboration and interaction between the organisations, including oversight of activities designed to combat the black economy.</p><p><i>- Operational Co-operation with Revenue:</i> In conjunction with Revenue, the Department undertakes site visits and inspections in the construction sector through assurance checks and outdoor operations, including inspections and direct investigations.  Joint Investigation Units have been established between the Department and Revenue and these units play a key role in targeting particular types of shadow economy activity and workers in the employed sectors, including construction. </p><p><i>- Working with Business and Unions:</i>    The Department participates on the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group with Revenue, employer and union representative bodies. This Group provides a formal structure to monitor developments, share experiences and make proposals for combating the hidden economy. </p><p><i>- Direct Investigations and Interventions:</i> Where intelligence or reliable reports are received about specific sectors or persons engaged in concurrent working and claiming or under declaration of income, then reviews of eligibility are immediately undertaken.  Case interventions are undertaken based on assessments of compliance risks and other relevant information.</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy should note that the Department has extensive legal powers to support the sharing of data for the purpose of controlling the entitlement and payment of benefits.  Data is exchanged on an on-going basis with agencies and, in particular, with Revenue to support its activities in combating shadow economy activity.  The approach taken by the Department is frequently reviewed and is regularly adjusted to concentrate on the areas of greatest risk, based on its operational experience and credible information received from industry and business sectors.</p></reply>

In order to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme in achieving this aim a variety of control measures and criteria have been introduced.  The Scheme is designed to guard against the displacement of apprentice positions and therefore placements in trades (mechanic, plumbing etc.) are not permitted under the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</p></reply>

The agreement was revised with effect from 1st April 2006.  The main purpose of the Agreement is to protect the pension rights of people who have worked and paid reckonable social security contributions in both Ireland and Australia.  The Agreement does this by allowing social security contributions paid in one country to be counted towards qualifying for certain payments in the other country.</p><p>  The Irish payments covered under the Agreement are: state pension (contributory), state pension (transition), widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension, guardian's payment (Contributory), invalidity pension, and bereavement grant.  The Australian payments covered under the Agreement are: age pensions, disability support pensions, and pensions for widows and widowers.  The Agreement also sets out arrangements for insuring workers assigned by their employer to work temporarily in each country.  In those circumstances a worker can continue to pay social insurance in the home country for up to 4 years.  An information booklet published by the Department with further details of this agreement can be found on the Department's website  at .</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 613,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children. </p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, is an important source of income for families. While issues relating to changes in taxation policy are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, I can confirm that the Government has not announced any plans to implement taxing or means-testing child benefit at this time.</p><p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare. The first report of the Group makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the system of child and family income supports.  While some members of the Advisory Group found that taxation of child benefit is an attractive reform option, there was a strong preference in the Group for an approach based on a two-tier payment which would encourage work participation and allow for better flexibility in the targeting of support for different family types. </p><p>  Given the range of complex issues involved, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is intended that the report will now contribute to a wider policy debate on the matter.  In considering the proposals to reform child and family income support payments I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

Cases are dealt with by the Medical Assessors on a clinical priority basis. The delay in processing applications for companion free travel passes on medical grounds is due to a number of factors such as the increase in volume of customer claims to the Disability and Illness related schemes and the time involved in assessing cases where there is lengthy medical evidence to be assessed. A recent campaign to reduce the number of claims and appeals awaiting assessment by the Medical Assessors has successfully reduced the backlog considerably. The present focus is on free travel and two Medical Assessors have been assigned to work fulltime on reducing the backlog of 1,714 free travel  referrals awaiting medical assessment. It is expected that this figure will reduce considerably in the near future.  Avenues are also being explored in conjunction with the scheme area to expedite decisions on these claims in the future.</p></reply>

The financial support available to foster parents from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs includes assistance with the cost of clothing and footwear for the foster child.

The objective of these projects was to introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to our customer in the face of increased claim loads. </p><p>  I am very pleased to say that claims involved in these backlogs have now all been actioned and in most cases cleared. The only area that is not yet fully cleared is Disability Allowance but major progress has been made and a plan is in place to action all backlogged applications by the end of July 2013.  New claims in all the schemes are being actioned promptly upon receipt. The current  average time to decide a new disability allowance application is now 7 weeks; invalidity pension is now 6 weeks; carer&rsquo;s allowance is now 8 weeks: FIS is less than 2 week for new claims and in advance for renewals.</p><p>  Following such a high volume of claim clearance in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013 the resulting volume of appeals is similarly high.  The time these appeals claims take to clear negatively affects the overall average time taken to award a claim.  But processing times on these schemes will continue to improve as appeals are worked through the system and cleared. </p><p>  In summary, the prompt processing of claims is the priority for all scheme mangers. Each scheme area is continuously monitoring its processes, procedures and the organisation of work to ensure that processing capability is maximised. </p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>It is anticipated that the introduction of the PSC will result in a number of financial and other benefits including:</p><p>- Reduction in the rate of fraud and errors caused by incorrectly identified and authenticated individuals.</p><p>- Improvement in existing cards (e.g. Social Services Cards and Free Travel), through better security features, considerably reducing the potential for forgery and fraudulent use.</p><p>- Improvement in the efficiency of every service delivered by the State through the removal of the duplication caused by multiple agencies each solving the problem of identity and authentication themselves.</p><p>A PSC is currently issued following a registration process, which involves the capture/utilisation of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department. To date, the Department has deployed two registration methods  &ndash; a &lsquo;face to face&rsquo; process involving personal attendance at a DSP Office  and a centrally managed &lsquo;reduced process&rsquo; which does not require personal attendance but rather utilises data already held by other State agencies (in the first instance, the Passport Office).</p><p>The face to face registration process is now live in over 51 DSP Offices with 112 SAFE Stations in production. Some 565 staff have been trained.  Over 270,000 PSC&rsquo;s have been issued to date.  The majority of these cards have been issued to new claimants for Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance and applicants for a new PPS number in Local Offices that have been equipped to carry out SAFE registrations.

This is due to the high number of claims processed in the past 12 months and the resulting increase in the number of appeals. In the last 4 weeks alone approximately 550 successful appeal cases were received in invalidity pension section. These cases will be processed and paid.</p><p>  Invalidity pension section has been involved in a business process improvement review and backlog elimination programme.  This programme has led to a significant reduction in the number of invalidity pension claims awaiting decision, down from 7007 claims at end May 2012 to 1973 claims at the end of June 2013.   In addition, new claims are now processed on receipt with a decision being made based on information provided or, if this is not possible, further medical evidence or additional information is requested and a decision is made on receipt. </p></reply>

While there is no pre-determined level of replacement rate, which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, higher replacement rates may indicate lower incentives to take up employment.  In this regard a replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive.</p><p>The table below sets out replacement rates values for the requested household types, which compare social welfare income, assuming that fuel allowance and rent allowance is payable, with net income at National Minimum Wage (NMW), two thirds of the Average Weekly Earnings (67% AWE) and Average Weekly Earnings (AWE).</p><p>Relevant calculations use the current national minimum wage of &euro;8.65 and an average weekly earnings figure of &euro;687.84 - derived from the Central Statistics Office material in relation to the second quarter of 2012. Calculations in relation to rent supplement are based on rent allowance rates for Dublin effective in 2012 &ndash; and do not reflect new rent supplement rates introduced in June 2013. It may also be noted that rent supplement rates are higher in Dublin than in other counties.</p><p><table><tr><th>Income Type</th><th>NMW</th><th>NMW with rent</th><th>67% AWE</th><th>67% AWE with rent</th><th>AWE</th><th></th><th>AWE with rent</th></tr><tr><td>Single</td><td>61%</td><td><div>86%</div></td><td>50%</td><td><div>70%</div></td><td>37%</td><td></td><td><div>52%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Couple: 1 earner</td><td>68%</td><td><div>95%</div></td><td>64%</td><td><div>89%</div></td><td>55%</td><td></td><td><div>77%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Couple: 1 earner/1 Child Dependent</td><td>72%</td><td><div>103%</div></td><td>68%</td><td><div>97%</div></td><td>61%</td><td></td><td><div>87%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Couple: 1 earner/2 Child Dependents</td><td>75%</td><td><div>105%</div></td><td>71%</td><td><div>99%</div></td><td>66%</td><td></td><td><div>93%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Couple: 1 earner/4 Child Dependents</td><td>75%</td><td><div>100%</div></td><td>72%</td><td><div>95%</div></td><td>66%</td><td></td><td><div>87%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Almost three-quarters of the people on the Live Register are only claiming a personal rate for themselves. They are either single or may have a spouse or partner who is working. In addition, 53% of the people on the Live Register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate. This means that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Register each year.</p><p>High replacement rates are generally associated with a relatively high number of dependent children and/or receipt of rent or mortgage supplement. However, it is important to note that only some 9% of persons on the Live Register are in receipt of rent supplement, with a further 1.5% in receipt of mortgage interest supplement. The vast majority of jobseekers do not receive these additional supports.</p><p>It should be noted that significant moves have already been taken to address the impact of housing entitlements upon replacement rates. Arising out of commitments in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the Rent Supplement Scheme, proposals to integrate the systems for providing rent supplement and social housing support have been advanced. It is intended to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department (currently provided through Rent Supplement) to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment.</p><p>The effect of this transfer and the introduction of a new form of Housing Assistance Payment will be to address one of the significant disincentives to accessing full-time employment that exists under the Rent Supplement scheme. Under the new Housing Assistance Payment, the contribution that the tenant makes towards the rent is based on a means test that links the level of contribution to the household income, rather than employment status. This will have a positive impact on replacement rates.</p></reply>

Representations and recommendations have been made by various groups and organisations since the enactment of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and this Bill seeks to address these issues. The General Register Office, which administers the Civil Registration Service, has identified areas where legislative amendments are required to streamline the service to the general public.</p><p>  As previously stated, marriages of convenience, or &ldquo;sham marriages&rdquo; are defined as marriages which are entered into for the purpose of one of the parties gaining an automatic right of residency based on marriage to a person who already has a right of residency. </p><p>  The matter is a complex one. EU citizens and their families have the right to move and reside freely within the territories of the Member States.  These rights also apply to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals following the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case on 25th July 2008.</p><p>  My Department has been considering this issue and has met with a number of stakeholders with a view to introducing measures to combat marriages of convenience.  In this regard, I intend to introduce legislation shortly that will make such marriages far more difficult to contract in the future.  The provisions will be part of legislation currently being drafted to amend the Civil Registration Act, 2004. I would hope to publish this legislation later this year.</p><p>  It should also be noted there are, at present, guidelines for registrars for marriage notifications containing requirements concerning notification procedures, including the verification of identity and marital status which can assist in the prevention of marriages of convenience. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-16a.1522.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071600090#WRJJ02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 658 and 659 together.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s control work is measured in terms of control savings and they are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment and refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error or any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their altered means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment. These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.</p><p>  Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means-tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department's medical assessors.  Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are checked on a regular basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seeking employment. </p><p>  Current measures to control fraud and abuse also include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mail-shots to selected customers, database checking and data matching with other organisations.</p><p>  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit focuses on planned and systematic control activity and projects.  The concentration is on those schemes and sectors where the incidence of social welfare fraud is most pronounced.  It works in conjunction with other agencies to tackle social welfare fraud and abuse.</p><p>  Furthermore INTREO, the integrated employment and support service currently being rolled out across the Department&rsquo;s local office network, comprehensively seeks to activate and review customers, where up to now three separate agencies had this role.  Arising from this, a more integrated approach to fraud control can now be realised.</p><p>  The roll out of the Public Service Card is also well underway. From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, the PSC gives significant assurance as to the identity of the cardholder as it is a secure card and will considerably reduce the potential for forgery and identity fraud. </p><p>  The Department recorded control savings of &euro;669 million in 2012.  The savings target for 2013 is &euro;710 million, an increase of over &euro;40m on 2012.  A total of just over &euro;240m was recorded in respect of control savings from January to end of May 2013.  I expect that the Department will achieve the target set for this year.  </p><p>  The overall goal of the Department in relation to debt management is to actively pursue the recovery of debt to maximise recovery levels, with due regard to value for money.  All debts currently owing to the Department, as a result of benefits received in excess of entitlement, are repayable in full.  The Department does not apply interest or penalties on the amounts owing.</p><p>  Customers who have received an overpayment from the Department have a liability to refund the overpayment. The Social Welfare Act, 2012 introduced a provision allowing the Department to make a recovery from an individual&rsquo;s social welfare payment measuring up to 15% of their weekly personal rate.  The deduction of 15% applies to the person&rsquo;s personal rate only, and does not affect payment of any adult or child dependent allowances, or any other allowances that are in payment.  It allows the person to retain 85% of their personal rate of payment.  In each case, the person is informed of the Department&rsquo;s intentions and given the opportunity to comment before a final decision is made on the level of deduction to be applied. </p><p>  The volume of debtors to the Department repaying their debt has increased by approximately 20% in the first six months of 2013.  As recoveries are reported on an annual basis only, a figure for the amount recovered in the first six months of this year is not available.  </p></reply>

Persons who claim Jobseekers Benefit from 3<sup>rd</sup> April 2013 can only claim for a maximum duration of 9 months provided they have 260 or more contributions (or 6 months if less than 260 contributions). Persons who exhaust their entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit can subsequently apply for Jobseekers Allowance, provided they meet the conditions for receipt of that payment. For the purposes of eligibility for Community Employment, a person can combine time spent in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit with time spent in receipt of another CE-eligible social welfare payment, such as Jobseekers Allowance, providing it makes up a continuous 12-month qualifying period and that the person is still currently in receipt of a qualifying payment immediately prior to commencing CE.   Persons not eligible for other assistance payments due to a partner's income may, however, be eligible for participation on other programmes, although they may not qualify for payment of an allowance e.g. F&Aacute;S training courses.  Such persons are advised to contact their local Employment Services Office or Intreo office (where available) where an Employment Services Officer will be happy to discuss the employment and training options that are open to them.</p><p>In relation to JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme jobseekers that have a live claim and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/<b>Jobseekers Benefit</b>/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance or signing for Social Insurance Contribution credits for at least 3 months (78 days) or more in the last 6 months are eligible to participate.</p></reply>

The package included a number of initiatives focused on providing work opportunities for jobseekers, including the provision of 10,000 additional work placements across a number of schemes.  The additional placements on community employment, T&uacute;s and JobBridge have already been rolled-out and are in the process of being filled by the sponsoring organisations and implementing bodies.</p><p>Gateway is a new initiative with local authorities to provide part-time work opportunities.  This is in line with the commitments set out in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> and <i>Pathways to Work</i>    The design of Gateway has been largely completed and local authorities have been engaged in a process of identifying the nature of work and range of opportunities that can be made available across their administrative and operational areas.  Local authorities have been asked to complete consultations with staff representative bodies and other key stakeholders to enable the scheme to commence on a staged basis over the coming months.</p><p>  Following referral of interested customers by the Department, each local authority will conduct their own recruitment process, involving skill profiling, job matching and vetting by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before a person is assigned to a position.  Already, 13 local authorities have identified some 800-1,000 places for immediate recruitment with the objective of beginning work in late September/early October 2013 (pending improvements in the timeframe for Garda Vetting).  Selection of potential participants is due to commence in the coming week and therefore no places have as yet been filled. </p><p>  In addition to the above local authorities fifteen county and city councils intend to  begin selection in August and September with a view to adding 600-1,000 placements when fully operational.

The scheme takes into account all income from farming and off-farm self-employment, including that of the farmer&rsquo;s spouse/partner, in which business-related expenses are disregarded.  The purpose of this exercise is to estimate the normal level of net income from self-employment in which one-off exceptional circumstances are taken into account.  All other factors, such as earnings from insurable employment and the estimated value of capital (including property other than the farm and the individual&rsquo;s principal private residence), are also included in the assessment.

The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage, and via an area based approach.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the eligible homeowners.  To date the programme has addressed almost 100,000 fuel poor homes, 5,500 of those in 2013. </p><p>  Dormer roofs present particular technical challenges meaning that traditional insulation, as used under the scheme, can only be installed in certain parts of the roof space resulting in only partial insulation coverage.  A full insulation solution would only be possible with recourse to expensive internal dry-lining, not provided under the scheme due to budgetary constraints.  Furthermore, the provision of adequate ventilation in an attic space to mitigate the risks of harmful condensation increases costs significantly.  The practice of insulating dormer roofs through the scheme was reviewed in mid-2012, in the context of trying to address the maximum number of energy poor homes from within available resources.  On balance it was decided that the significant additional costs are not generally justified relative to the marginal insulation gains.  Therefore insulation of dormer roofs has not been implemented under the scheme since July 2012.</p><p>Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hotline can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to    and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

This strategy reiterates the Government&rsquo;s firm view that &ldquo;the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant indigenous renewable energy resources, both onshore and offshore, clearly stands on its own merits in terms of contribution to the economy, to the jobs and growth agenda, to environmental sustainability and to diversity of energy supply&rdquo;.  It is this position that informs Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to delivering on its binding EU obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive, which assigned 2020 renewable targets to each Member State in 2009.</p><p>  On the basis of expert advice, the Strategy for Renewable Energy also identified Ireland has the capability to achieve our national targets for renewable electricity from onshore renewable generation alone.  In addition, it also recognised that Ireland has an excellent and abundant renewable energy resource, which has the potential to produce amounts of renewable electricity significantly in excess of the amounts required to meet our 2020 target.  It is in this context that the opportunity to harness this resource for the export market, and realise its potential for investment, job creation and economic growth has been identified.</p><p>  To this end, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation with my UK counterpart, Mr. Edward Davey, on 24 January this year. This MoU clearly signals the joint interest of Ireland and the UK in developing the opportunity for trading in renewable energy to our mutual benefit.</p><p>  Detailed consideration of how Ireland&rsquo;s onshore and offshore wind resources might be developed for export to the UK is now underway, with a view to determining if it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) under the EU Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>  There are very complex issues to be considered, such as, the actual scale of the export generation capacity required by the UK, the approach to be taken to grid development, the job creation potential and other economic benefits for Ireland, and the sharing of potential benefits between both States.  The mechanism for remunerating any wind farms that may in the future export renewable energy to the UK has yet to be decided, but will not involve any subsidy costs being imposed on the Irish State.  Any IGA would also have to ensure an adequate return to the Irish Exchequer.</p><p>  Though it is ambitious, the target for completion of this work is early 2014, with a view to electricity being exported to the UK by 2020 in order to be counted towards the UK&rsquo;s national target under the Renewables Directive. </p><p>  Should an IGA be entered into, the development of any new wind farms for the export market would be underpinned by a clear policy framework. Such developments would also be subject to a selection process and to the Planning and Development Acts, including their requirements for public consultation.  Based on principles yet to be established in an IGA, the need for further analysis to identify in more detail, the upper levels of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to develop generation and transmission infrastructure for large scale export of renewable energy, taking into account environmental and planning considerations, has been identified. </p></reply>

It has a total complement of around 250 full time equivalent staff of whom a limited number are technical personnel. This reality necessarily requires my Department to procure specialist external professional advice notably in legal, financial and technical areas to enable it to discharge its very wide brief.  In procuring these specialised services, my Department always seeks to ensure value for money and that these professional services contribute to project delivery and</p><p>informed, robust and evidence based policy making. Furthermore, in relation to the competitive tendering for contracts my Department adheres to the relevant EU Regulations and Department of Finance Guidelines on the procurement of goods and services. I would also point out that many of the consultancies relate to individual time limited projects where it is more sensible from a value for money perspective to engage consultants rather than permanent staff. In a number of cases, e.g. Tellus Border Project, the cost is either fully or partially funded by the EU.</p><p>Applying a unilateral 20% reduction in professional fees would reduce the amount paid by approximately &euro;1m. This figure is however a mathematical exercise, as the competitive tendering process ensures a market rate is obtained for the professional services being delivered.</p><p><b>Professional fees paid by the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resource</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description of Service</th><th>Amount (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Mason Communications (Irl) Ltd</td><td>Communications Consultancy on digital projects</td><td>65,812</td></tr><tr><td>David Fox Associates</td><td>Petroleum Engineering </td><td>124,675</td></tr><tr><td>Deloitte &amp;amp;

Details of broadband services available in each County, including Counties Cork and Louth, can be found on ComReg's website at    .</p><p>  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all of our citizens and businesses, in advance of the EU's target date of 2020.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services.  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas which are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market alone.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver of high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

For some time now the administrations in Northern Ireland and Ireland have cooperated actively on energy policy.  There is top level political commitment in both jurisdictions to the development of competition in the energy sectors in the interests of delivering improved services and economic benefits to all customers on the island.</p><p>  Cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland on energy matters takes place under the auspices of a Joint Steering Group (JSG) established in July 2003.  The group comprises of senior officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and the offices of the two Regulatory Authorities, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR).</p><p>  The all island electricity market or Single Electricity Market (SEM) has developed from the all island energy project.  The aim of the project is to create a single market for natural gas and electricity on the island of Ireland. The project was started following a joint policy decision by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to create the all-island energy market.  The Development Framework for the All Island Energy Market was published jointly by the Departments and Regulators in November 2004.</p><p>  The Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Single Electricity Market (SEM) in December 2006.  The document describes the arrangements in relation to the establishment and operation of a single wholesale electricity market in Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p><p>  Subsequent legislation in Northern Ireland and Ireland was put in place to underpin the SEM, including the establishment of the SEM Committee, a committee of CER, NIAUR and an Independent Member.  This enables effective decision-making on single electricity market matters and makes provision for the objectives of Ministers and Regulators with regard to matters which affect, or are likely to affect the SEM.  The SEM has operated successfully since it launched in November 2007.</p><p>  My Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Northern Ireland, the CER and NIAUR are working together on the development of the All -Island Common Arrangements for Gas whereby all stakeholders can buy, sell, transport, operate, develop and plan the natural gas market north and south of the border effectively on an all-island basis.  The CER and NIAUR signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2008, outlining the high level principles of the CAG project.  I note that the regulators have made considerable progress to date, and that the current state of play on CAG is that their work is continuing, in particular on the studies commissioned by the Regulators.</p><p>Energy matters are not one of the six areas of cooperation that fall within the remit of the North South Ministerial Council.  These are agriculture, education, environment, health, tourism and transport.  The Joint Secretariat of the North South Ministerial Council has, amongst other functions, the tasks of arranging the schedule of Council meetings and securing prior political agreement to agendas for meetings of the Council.  </p></reply>

Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Tipperary, can be found on ComReg's website at    .</p><p>  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all of our citizens and businesses, in advance of the EU's target date of 2020.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services.  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas which are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market alone.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat) and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation, as set out in legislation.  The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup, inter alia, the additional costs incurred by electricity suppliers in sourcing, and ESB Power Generation producing, a proportion of their electricity from such generators.</p><p>  Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 sets out the legal basis for the PSO levy in Ireland.  Statutory Instrument No. 217 of 2002 made under Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act requires that the CER calculates and certifies the costs associated with the PSO and sets the associated levy for the required period.  The PSO levy takes into account the estimated and actual costs incurred in undertaking generation activities which are covered in the relevant PSO legislation.  Articles 8 and 9 of Statutory Instrument 217 of 2002 set out the methodology of the calculation of the components of the PSO levy and the estimation of the amount of the PSO levy by the CER.</p><p>  The specific information requested by the Deputy (including the various breakdowns and historical data) is publically available on the CER website at the following link: </p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Wicklow, can be found on ComReg's website at    .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services. The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway. </p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas which are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market alone.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  The Government remains firmly committed to increasing the availability countrywide of quality next generation broadband services and to ensuring that citizens, businesses and all parts of society are motivated, empowered and have the requisite connectivity to interact effectively in a digital environment.</p></reply>

The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.

Assuming that th e level of payment in 2013 will be si milar to that observed in 2012, some &euro;22 m is anticipated to be raised between July and December 2013.  It should be noted, however, that a considerable amount of revenue is raised in respect of a given liability date in the subsequent year.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters , including the most appropriate method of valuation.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system. A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system. Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.   </p><p>I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses at the present time.  Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013 and have responded well to such requests in recent years. In 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.   </p><p>Local authorities have a leading role in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones. They are committed to local economic development, and are best placed to meet many of the needs of businesses, in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures. Under the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>, the local government sector has developed a sectoral strategy, <i><i>Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs - Locally</i></i><i>,</i><b></b>  to promote employment and support local enterprise, including measures in the area of business charges, local enterprise and business support arrangements, procurement support, local development and community-based initiatives, the Green Economy and participation in employment support schemes. </p><p>The implementation of the <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First</i>   provides an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis, having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness. It is vital that progress is made in this area, given the importance of local enterprises to employment and to the economy generally. </p><p>While I have no immediate plans to amend the legislation governing commercial rates, I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-16a.1755.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071600090#WROO02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 742, 780 and 781 together.</p><p>  The Programme for Government   commits to the development of a coherent national waste policy, adhering to the waste hierarchy, which will aim to minimise waste disposal in landfill and maximise recovery. In addition, Ireland must comply with strict limits under the Landfill Directive for the volumes of material which are landfilled. </p><p>I published <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i>   in July 2012 which clearly signalled my intent ion to raise the landfill levy in July 2013 in order to provide certainty, in the form of both policy and legislation, so that the necessary actions and investments are progressed to achieve the policy's objectives.     </p><p>  The landfill levy is chargeable on waste presented for disposal at landfill facilities.  The National Waste Report for 2011 noted that the increasing landfill levy and the economic down-turn contributed in significant ways to Ireland's achievement of the 2010 EU Landfill Directive diversion target for biodegradable waste through significant decreases in municipal waste generation and quantity of residual waste consigned to landfill. </p><p>  Preliminary 2012 data indicate that the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste disposed at landfill in 2011 was 771,551 tonnes. This is 161,551 tonnes in excess of the July 2013 EU Landfill Directive limit and 344,551 tonnes in excess of the 2016 limit. This further underlines the importance of effective economic instruments, such as the landfill levy, which are key to encouraging more sustainable management of our waste. </p><p>Accordingly, I recently, in exercise of the powers conferred on me by sections 7, 18(3) and 73 of the Waste Management Act 1996 (No. 10 of 1996), increased the landfill levy by 10 euro to 75 euro per tonne with effect from 1 July 2013 for each tonne of waste disposed of at authorised and unauthorised landfill facilities.      This increase sends a further strong price signal to the producers, collectors and managers of waste, to deter against unsustainable behaviour and to encourage a shift away from landfill to waste management practices which are more closely aligned with the higher tiers of the waste hierarchy.  </p><p>The estimate d   2013 total revenue to be received into the Environment Fund f rom the landfill levy is &euro;50.8 m. The proceeds of the Environment Fund, which was established under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001, can only be used for activities that are of benefit to the environment.   Section 74(9) of the Waste Management Act 1996 (as amended), specifies the purposes for which payments may be made from the Environment Fund.   These include assistance in a range of areas such as:</p><p> - schemes to prevent/reduce waste;</p><p> - waste recovery activities;</p><p> - research &amp;amp; development into waste management;</p><p> - production, distribution or sale of products deemed to be less harmful to the environment than other similar products;</p><p> - development of producer initiatives to prevent/reduce waste arising from their activities;</p><p> - implementation of waste management plans;</p><p> - enforcement of the provisions of any enactment relating to waste management, prevention of litter or protection of the environment;</p><p> - partnership projects, that involve local authorities, to improve the quality of the environment for particular local communities;</p><p> - promotion of awareness of the need to protect the environment, including national and regional campaigns;</p><p> - promotion /support of education and training to assist achievement of campaign objectives;</p><p> - resources (human or material) to enable education and training to be carried out;</p><p> - initiatives undertaken by community groups and others for protection of the environment;</p><p> - initiatives undertaken by international organisations and others for protection of the environment and/or sustainable development;</p><p> - such other purposes for protection of the environment as may be prescribed by the nister in regulations.   </p><p>The audited Environment Fund Accounts are available for download at </p></reply>

In particular, the levy was introduced as an anti-litter measure designed to influence consumers by encouraging them to reduce their use of disposable plastic bags.</p><p>Section 72 of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by s ection 9 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 , provided for the introduction of a plastic bag levy.   The Waste Management (Environmental Levy)(Plastic Bag) Order 2007 and the Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 allowed for the levy to be increased from its previous level of 15 cent per bag to 22 cent per bag from 1 July 2007.</p><p>The introduction of the levy in March 2002 led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags supplied to consumers, from an estimated 328 bags per person per year prior to the introduction of the levy, to 21 bags per person by the end of 2002 and a further reduction to an estimated 14 bags per person by the end of 2012.</p><p>The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System is used to measure the impact of the plastic bag levy on an ongoing basis and my Department also monitors the receipts from the plastic bag levy to monitor trends in the average per capita consumption of plastic bags. These data are used to ensure that the plastic bag levy is set at an appropriate level. <i>The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Report 2012</i> report s that plastic bags constituted 0.30 % of litter arising in 2012 . This compares with 5% prior to the levy&rsquo;s introduction.</p><p>Receipts from the plastic b ag l evy for each year are published in the Environment Fund Annual Accounts .

For national road schemes, potential noise emissions are addressed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process undertaken by, or on behalf of, the National Roads Authority.   </p><p>In addition, the Environmental Noise Directive (END) 2002/49/EC sets out certain requirements for the assessment and management of environmental noise from transport sources, including the making of strategic noise maps and action plans. However the Directive does not set binding limit values, nor does it prescribe the measures to be included in the action plans, leaving those issues at the discretion of the national competent authorities.   </p><p>The END was transposed into national law by the Environmental Noise Regulations 2006.    The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned. The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.   </p><p>The Regulations designate noise mapping bodies and action planning authorities for the making of strategic noise maps and action plans. Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to local authorities. For the Dublin Agglomeration, distinct noise maps have been produced for all roads together with <font color="#263137">a related</font>   noise action plan for the period July 2008 to November 2013. </p><p>The Regulations require noise mapping bodies periodically to review and revise noise maps. A new round of noise mapping was conducted during 2012. Individual maps, along with details on the revised population exposure statistics, can be viewed at the following link- <font color="#0000FF"> </font>.  Following the noise mapping, the four local authorities within the Dublin Agglomeration prepared a new draft Environmental Noise Action Plan for the period 2013 - 2018. The draft plan sets out an approach to the strategic management and control of environmental noise over the next five years. It also provides the basis for feedback and input from the statutory authorities and the public to help inform the final Noise Plan for the Dublin Agglomeration. The draft plan was recently made available for public consultation with submissions being invited before 20 June 2013. Submissions received under the consultation process are now being reviewed before the plan is finalised.</p></reply>

It is intended, therefore, that the legislation to transfer statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water will provide for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements. The majority of the existing staff will remain employees of local authorities working under such arrangements.   </p><p>  A specific structure, the Irish Water Consultative Group, chaired by Mr Kevin Foley of the Labour Relations Commission, was established in 2012 to facilitate engagement between unions and management on the water sector reform programme. Under the auspices of this group, discussions have been held on the human resources aspects of the service level agreements. Agreement has been reached on a framework which provides, inter alia, for the duration of such agreements to be twelve years, with reviews after years two and seven. If a service level agreement is terminated or is not renewed, then the staff concerned will move to Irish Water with their terms, conditions and superannuation arrangements protected. </p><p>  Work being progressed at present on developing template service level agreements, and associated funding arrangements including an examination of the necessary processes for the transfer of assets and financial liabilities associated with these assets taking into account, <i>inter alia, </i>  the impacts on local government finances and the funding model for Irish Water. </p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation. The primary role of the Regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them. An appropriate approach to charging customers will be put in place and a public consultation will take place as part of the regulatory process. </p><p>Affordability issues will be addressed by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, in consultation with the Regulator, Irish Water and other stakeholders, in the context of developing a water pricing framework. The agreed approach to affordability issues will then be reflected in the charging structure established by the Regulator. N o decision ha s yet been taken on the level of, or the approach to, the free allowance. </p><p>  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, all  suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water   supplied is wholesome and clean. Water suppliers are required to comply with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. Hard water is not included as a parameter in the quality standards   specified in the Regulations, as it does not pose as a threat to human   health, nor indeed are the substances associated with hard water, such as lime, calcium and magnesium.</p></reply>

It has been decided, following the previous review of the Memorandum of Understanding by the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, that water charges will commence with effect from Quarter 4 2014. It is expected, therefore, that Irish Water will issue the first bills to customers in Quarter 1 2015.     </p><p>  Work is underway in developing the cost and funding profile for Irish Water. A key input to this is a fact-finding exercise underway in local authorities to provide data on the current cost base. The level of Exchequer subvention support will be determined as part of the budgetary process. </p><p>It will be a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in due course to satisfy itself in relation to the appropriateness of costs to be incurred by Irish Water in discharging its functions as part of the process of setting the tariffs for the domestic and non-domestic sector. It is envisaged that the Commission will engage in public consultation as part of this process. Pending the outcome of this process it is not possible to provide information on the estimated revenue of Irish Water in 2015.</p></reply>

Under section 60(3) of the Act I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it.  The vast majority of local authorities have exited the waste collection market.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) published by my Department in July 2012 considered the introduction of franchise bidding by local authorities for household waste collection.  This approach has been adopted in other EU Member States, whereby a local authority or group of authorities invite tenders from private operators to bid for the exclusive right to collect waste or certain streams of waste within their functional area. The RIA identified a number of risks associated with such an approach and ultimately made the recommendations to preserve the current market structure of side by side competition and to strengthen the regulation of household waste collection.</p><p>  I published <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i> in July 2012.  The publication of the policy , which is available on my Department's website, confirmed the retention of side by side competition in the household waste collection market and also brought much needed policy certainty to the waste sector, particularly in terms of facilitating planning and investment decisions.</p></reply>

Amounts reclaimed by account holders in the same years are &euro;20.3m, &euro;24.3m, &euro;22.0m and to end May 2013, &euro;8.0m.

My Department is consulting with relevant Government Departments and other stakeholders as appropriate in relation to drafting the disbursement scheme.  The new scheme will be submitted to Government for approval and, in accordance with the 2012 Act, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The 2012 Amendment also provides for the preparation of an action plan.  The plan, which will also be subject to consultation, must indicate the programmes or types of projects that may apply for disbursement and the maximum funds available.  Different amounts may be specified in the plan in relation to a particular class or classes of programme or project.  Once the plan is adopted, a copy must also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s implementation of the recommendations in the Keane Report my Department has developed a mortgage to rent scheme for households with commercial mortgages that:</p><p>- have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP ), as provided for under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears;</p><p>- agree to the voluntary surrender of their home;</p><p>- do not have significant positive equity, and;</p><p>- are eligible for social housing. </p><p>Under the scheme, which was launched nationally in June 2012, a household with mortgage arrears goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant of an approved housing body.  The household voluntarily surrender their property to their lender who in turn sell s the property to a voluntary housing body.  The housing body becomes the landlord and the household remain in the family home.</p><p>  Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in this regard.  My Department has issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct, which continue the tradition of handling arrears in a manner sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.</p><p>  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.</p></reply>

However, the adoption of development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.  Each planning authority is also required to include details of contributions received and contributions owing to it, together with information on how the contributions have been expended, in the statutory annual report of the authority.</p><p>As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage, in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal financial procedures.  Where any payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt and, until such time as amounts outstanding are discharged in full, the conditions of the relevant planning permission have not been met and the development is unauthorised.  With regard to charging interest on late payments, the enforcement of conditions attached to a planning permission, including conditions relating to the payment of development contributions, is a matter for individual planning authorities.</p><p>Information on amounts due is available on an annual basis with 2011 being the latest year for which audited information is available.

Mayo North East Leader Partnership (MNELP) is the Local Action Group contracted by my Department to deliver the Programme to the North East Mayo area including the area of Swinford.  I have informed the Company of my decision in principle to allow a limited resumption of its activities under the Programme once contracts and administrative procedures have been agreed with my Department and put in place.  My Department has issued a revised contract to MNELP and it is expected that the formalities will be completed very shortly.  I understand that MNELP has yet to complete the project evaluation process in relation to this project.  However, once the revised administrative procedures are fully operational the project will be fully evaluated.  As the grant amount requested for this particular project is over &euro;150,000 the project, it will then have to be submitted to my Department for final approval if it is successful in the evaluation stage.</p></reply>

In April 2009, my Department, following a review of the Serviced Land Initiative in light of developments in the economy at large, and in the housing market in particular during 2008, and having regard to the oversupply of housing in some areas, informed all local authorities that all existing approvals under the Initiative, for which contracts had not been signed or letters of intent had issued, were being withdrawn.  However, authorities were also advised that where a water services authority was of the opinion that the continuation of an approved scheme for which contracts had not been signed was necessary for the proper development of the area, it was open to the authority to make a case to the Department by the end of May 2009 for the scheme to progress.

The proposed redevelopment did not proceed at the time due to the prevailing economic conditions.  However, the provision of commercial, retail and other services in Ballymun, and at this prominent site in particular, remains very important within the context of the overall regeneration programme.

This has facilitated the demolition of all but one of the towers and nearly all the flat blocks as well as the construction of over 2,900 social, voluntary, private and affordable residential units, new local parks and playgrounds, neighbourhood centres and a new traditional style main street.  The programme has also provided state of the art community facilities, such as the Axis theatre, the Leisure Centre and Civic Centre.  This project has now moved into its completion phase and my Department&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the remaining housing need is met while the investment to date is fully protected.  My Department understand s that Ballymun Regeneration Ltd (BRL) currently has three empty retail units available in Coultry.  BRL has engaged an estate agent to let or lease these properties to interested parties with the objective of supporting and sustaining commercial and retail activity in Ballymun.

In practical terms, increasing the amount available in the Fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant accounts measures or programmes.  While applying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to credit union accounts could increase the size of the Fund, Government Departments and agencies must source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation in the same way as with any other funding programme.  When the monies expended on dormant accounts measures and programmes are reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund, the refund is to the Exchequer rather than to the spending Department.  For this reason, dormant accounts expenditure is subject to the same constraints within Departments as any other spending programme.  In addition, expenditure on new dormant accounts measures or programmes would serve to increase Government debt levels as money disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund belongs to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not to the State.  Consequently, every euro spent from the Fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority, by order, to declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road.  Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received.  The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act.  However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

The Agency is also the statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement of environmental legislation in Ireland.  Details of all prosecutions taken by the Agency for pollution incidents and details of it&rsquo;s enforcement activities are published on the Agency&rsquo;s website.  Regulation 11 of the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Surface Waters) Regulations 2009 requires that not later than 22 December 2012, the terms of every authorisation, including licences issued under Section 4 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, be examined and a determination made as to whether the authorisation / licence requires to be reviewed. In accordance with Regulation 13, it is an offence not to comply with a requirement of the regulations.</p><p>  All local authorities have completed their examination of Section 4 licences and have determined whether a review is required.  While the majority of these reviews were completed by 22 December 2012, I understand that a number are still ongoing.  In this regard, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Regulations 1978 and 1992 set down a procedure for reviewing Section 4 licences which provides for a requirement for statutory notices, time periods to respond to such notices and an appeals mechanism to An Bord Pleanala.  The European Commission does not ordinarily request information regarding these issues but may make enquiries in relation to specific cases.</p></reply>

In addition, section 57 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, which amended section 21 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997, conferred powers on local authorities to make bye-laws for the purposes of preventing the creation of, and controlling, litter within their functional areas.  These bye-laws can require the occupiers of specified premises or classes of premises to take such measures as are deemed necessary by the local authority to prevent or limit the creation of litter at or in the vicinity of such premises and provide for its removal.  The role of my Department is to provide the legislative framework within which to combat litter pollution and in that regard, following a review of legislation, my Department is currently preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of an on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping.</p></reply>

In the period since the preparation of the Local Government Efficiency Report, from 2010 to end 2012, the savings achieved and projected are reported at &euro;561m.  The majority of the efficiency savings identified relate to staffing reductions and procurement. </p><p>  Shared services have been identified in the Local Government Efficiency Review and the Public Service Reform Plan as an important opportunity to make further savings in administrative costs, while streamlining and improving service delivery without impacting on front line services. </p><p>  To drive the reform agenda, and in particular shared service initiatives, in the local government sector, a dedicated Programme Management Office (PMO) has been established which reports to a high-level Oversight Group. </p><p>  Overall, 31 operational areas are being examined for potential as a shared service or other collaborative approach that may provide efficiencies.  The PMO has adopted a comprehensive methodology for the development and evaluation of projects including, gathering and analysing baseline data, business case preparation and peer review of business cases. </p><p>  Treasury Management, Payroll, Transactional HR and Procurement have been prioritised in the shared services programme in the short to medium term.  It is estimated that annual savings of the order of &euro;6.4 million could be achieved (excluding procurement) from these projects.  The figures will be subjected to third-party validation as part of the project processes.   </p><p>  In relation to procurement, the project is being led and co-ordinated by Kerry County Council as the lead authority in the Local Authority National Procurement Office.  Since 2010, local authorities have reported procurement savings of approximately &euro;109 million.  Kerry County Council is working with the new Chief Procurement Officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and further savings of between &euro;16.25 million and &euro;19.5 million have been targeted for the sector in 2013.   </p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing. </p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be redistributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.  The approach used to allocate the 20% of Local Property Tax revenue available for equalisation will depend on factors such as overall yield and yields at ind ividual local authority level.  The priority will be to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.   </p><p>  The details concerning Local Property Tax and Local Government Fund revenue for local authorities will be decided in the context of Budget 2014.   </p><p>   I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.   </p><p>  An important purpose of the changes to the funding of the local authorities is to place the local government sector on a more sustainable financial footing.  The concept of financial sustainability should not solely be considered in terms of national recovery from our current economic circumstances over the short to medium term; longer-term viability and the connection with the citizen are also important elements.  I am satisfied that the changes which are currently under way will deliver a model of funding which is sustainable in the broadest sense.   </p></reply>

Local authorities are required to examine all potential options in an even-handed manner before determining an appropriate procurement option.</p><p>The overriding consideration is that all projects must deliver value for money and to this end each potential project is subjected to a Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) report.<b>  </b>This report consists of a comprehensive risk adjusted costing of the project elements over the whole life of the project on the basis of conventional procurement and enables a comparison to be made on a like for like basis between traditional and PPP procurement to ensure that the best value for money procurement option is chosen.</p><p>A project is not categorised as a PPP project until the PSB report is completed and a decision is made on the procurement route.  Therefore there are no Public Private Partnership projects which have proceeded under traditional procurement methods.</p><p>The table below lists all the water services PPP projects with a value in excess of &euro;20 million, and includes details of the PSB findings and the contractor engaged to carry out the project.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the most appropriate method of valuation.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.  A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system.  Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.   </p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses at the present time.  Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013.  Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.   </p><p>  I have no immediate plans to amend the legislation governing commercial rates.  I am, however, keeping the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.   </p></reply>

Illegal dumping is first and foremost a matter of individual responsibility and compliance with the law, rather than of product design.  While enforcement action in this area is a matter in the first instance for local authorities, my Department has taken a number of actions to address the issue. </p><p>  In 2012, I introduced a once-off Litter Enforcement Grants Scheme, targeted specifically at the issue of fly tipping and small scale illegal dumping, encouraging local authorities to enhance their existing enforcement activities, through measures such as the purchase of CCTV equipment to allow for the effective monitoring of known litter black spots.  I also launched, again in 2012, a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency&rsquo;s National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.   </p><p>  Existing penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment.  The maximum fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution. </p><p>  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial.  Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. </p><p>  Following a review of legislation in this area and notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place, my Department is currently preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of a specific on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping.  I expect to be in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval shortly.   </p><p>  Enforcement action in relation to illegal dumping is a matter for the relevant local authority concerned and also the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE), which supervises the environmental protection activities of local authorities.  My Department provides funding to support the activities of a network of local authority environmental enforcement officers and the OEE.  Each local authority sets out an annual programme of action, detailing its planned enforcement action in relation to activities such as illegal dumping, towards which this funding will be utilised. </p></reply>

In addition my Department has agreed to fund up to 50% of the cost of reinstatement under a lease agreement in returning a property in the same condition as at the commencement of the lease, less fair wear and tear.

Definitive details, arrangements and procedures in relation to the financial relationships between district and county levels will be developed in the context of the new local government funding arrangements generally, the implementation of the new sub-county system and the preparation of the legislation in relation to the reform programme.   </p><p>  In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts.  These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, established under the <b>Maastricht</b> Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year.  The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances. </p><p>  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance.  The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.</p><p>  It is a matter for every local authority , including town councils, to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.     </p></reply>

This permission was renewed for a further three-year period in August 2010, valid to 14 August 2013 in each case.

A presiding judge is responsible for the administration of his or her court.  The decision reached in any case and the factors taken into account in determining a case are matters for the presiding judge who is subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard lies in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the Judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families.  The Judiciary, through the Judicial Research Office, is undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.  This includes an analysis of sentencing in rape cases published in January last.  The Deputy may also be aware that I have established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review of all aspects of penal policy which I expect to report to me in the autumn.  In addition, the Law Reform Commission has recently published a report on Mandatory Sentencing.  The recommendations contained in the report will be fully considered in my Department together with the report of the Penal Policy Review Group when it has been finalised.</p></reply>

In keeping with this approach, I will continue to seek to identify the potential for additional funding for the Garda Fleet.  This will, of course, be contingent on expenditure in other areas across and outside the Justice Sector.</p></reply>

I am also informed that the Department of Health is preparing legislative proposals for a Human Tissue Bill which will set out a detailed consent framework for the removal, donation and use of organs from deceased and living persons for the purpose of transplantation. </p><p><b><i><i>Question Nos. 62, 65 and 66 of 10 July, 2013</i></i></b></p><p><b><i>Question No.</i></b><i> 62 (Ref No: 33719/13 Proof: 70)</i></p><p><i>To ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade the position in relation to illegal organ harvesting and trading; the measures taken to ensure that no Irish company, organisation or individual is involved in such practices; the steps taken to outline concerns in this matter to the Chinese authorities, particularly in relation to the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</i></p><p><b><i>Question No.</i></b><i> 65  (Ref No: 33808/13 Proof: 74)</i></p><p><i>To ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade his views on the position of Falun Gong practitioners in Chinese society.</i></p><p><b><i>Question No.</i></b><i> 66 (Ref No: 33846/13 Proof: 75)</i></p><p><i>To ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade his views of an a matter regarding forced organ harvesting (details supplied); his plans to bring forward laws that will stop all Irish companies, organisations, persons, physicians and the health services form being accomplices in the heinous crime of organ trafficking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</i></p><p><b><i><i>Reply:</i></i></b></p><p><i>I propose to take question no: 62, 65 and 66 together and to make a statement on the matter. </i></p><p><i>The Government follows closely reports of human rights violations against Falun Gong practitioners, including reported cases of organ harvesting, and is concerned about the situation.  Human rights issues, including the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, are issues discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral and multilateral meetings.</i></p><p><i>Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 25 June 2013 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment.</i></p><p><i>At this meeting, the EU also enquired about measures taken so far by China to ratify the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998 in view of China's undertaking made during the 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to ratify the Covenant at an early date. </i></p><p><i>In February 2013, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.

I am advised that a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority and that a public information leaflet, <i>A Guide to the Noise Regulations,</i>outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government,  . </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the leases for apartment dwellings often contain conditions or covenants which are designed to regulate aspects of the building's use for the benefit of residents.  These covenants form part of the contractual arrangements entered into by residents themselves and are essentially a matter for the parties concerned.</p><p>  In relation to situations where residents may be subject to harassment and anti-social behaviour, I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy personnel to establish a highly visible and accessible service to communities to tackle crime, the fear of crime and anti-social behaviour.  </p><p>  However, in the absence of specific details as to the nature or location of the incidents, or of the intimidation referred to, it is not possible to provide a specific response from the Garda authorities on this matter.  However, if a person feels that a crime has been committed they should contact their local Garda station.  All crimes that are reported to Garda&iacute; are fully and thoroughly investigated and offenders brought to justice wherever possible.  As well as contacting the Garda&iacute; directly, information can be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by way of the Garda confidential line, 1800 666 111, which is a monitored freephone line that allows members of the public to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with information of a confidential nature.</p></reply>

While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hands, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process.  It is a statutory requirement that, <i>inter alia</i>, applicants for naturalisation be of good character.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  I can, however, inform the Deputy that enormous progress has been made in dealing with the backlog and steps are being taken to process all outstanding applications as quickly as possible. </p><p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Numbers 99/2013, 100/2013 and 101/2013) came into effect on 8 April 2013.  The instruments regulate the procedures whereby parties or other persons wishing to have access to records of court proceedings, including audio recordings, may apply to the court concerned for access to such records.  The instruments also set out the terms on which such access may be granted.  There is nothing to prevent a party to a case applying to the court to access the recording. However, the granting of access and the terms under which such access is granted is a matter for the court.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>In common with all court rules these instruments are available on the Courts Service website.  There are no prescribed fees in respect of CDs of court proceedings and, as indicated above, it is entirely a matter for the court to allow access to records of court proceedings or to determine whether access may be granted by CD or transcript.  </p><p>  I am informed that Digital Audio Recordings have been made in the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal since 2005, in the High Court and in Circuit Courts since 2009 and in the District Court since 2011.  All recordings made to date are being retained.  The relevant court officers together with the contracted external service provider have responsibility for operating and administering the digital audio recording system.  </p></reply>

No new information has been put forward which would warrant a departure from this conclusion.</p><p>  In order to identify the level of demand for access to ongoing counselling and medical services, and so as not to interfere in the privacy of any of the survivors or bereaved, a public information notice was placed in newspapers in October 2009 asking those who wished to access such services through this channel to register their interest.  Arrangements to provide these services were put in place in February 2010, based on the response received.  This facility remains in place for those who wish to avail of it.</p></reply>

Details in respect of each category are as follows:</p><p><bu>Civil Legal Aid</bu></p><p>The Legal Aid Board (LAB) is the statutory body which provides legal aid and advice in civil law matters to persons on lower incomes.  All Board services are governed by the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations.  I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board provides 'legal aid' and not 'free legal aid'.  The vast majority of persons receiving services from the Board pay a small financial contribution.</p><p>In respect of civil legal aid, Exchequer funding is provided by way of grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board.  The relevant amounts allocated are set out hereunder.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Total Amount of Expenditure <br />(&euro; million)</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>32.192</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>30.370</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32.922</td></tr><tr><td>2013 - to date</td><td>19.384</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that the figures for 2012 onwards include funding in respect of the Family Mediation Service, for which the Board assumed responsibility in late 2011.

Under the Act, the grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, in certain circumstances, up to two counsel, in the preparation and conduct of their defence or appeal. The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary.</p><p>Total expenditure on criminal legal aid for the years referred to by the Deputy is detailed below.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Total Amount of Expenditure <br />(&euro; million)</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>56.5</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>56.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>50.5</td></tr><tr><td>2013 - to date</td><td>25.6</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy will note that total expenditure for 2012 represented a reduction of 10% over 2011.

I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts.</p><p>It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.</p><p>Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.</p><p>Below are two tables of statistics. The first table provides a breakdown of RIA residents giving details of the numbers of persons from the date of their initial asylum application.  It is important to note that protection applicants are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change.  Therefore, while the statistics below will show the length of time that has elapsed since those persons who are currently availing of RIA accommodation made their initial application, this does not necessarily mean that they have been residing in RIA accommodation for all of that time. The second table provides a nationality breakdown for those residents.</p><p>In relation to such detail for persons outside RIA accommodation in the asylum and leave to remain processes, this is a more complex undertaking and the information cannot be provided in the time available. Material not already provided in this answer is currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy directly.</p><p>Persons in RIA accommodation:</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Number of years from initial application</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>0-6 months</div></td><td><div>277</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>6-12 months</div></td><td><div>289</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>1-2 years</div></td><td><div>431</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2-3 years</div></td><td><div>490</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>3-4 years</div></td><td><div>589</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>4-5 years</div></td><td><div>701</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>5-6 years</div></td><td><div>707</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>6-7 years</div></td><td><div>532</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>7 + years</div></td><td><div>600</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>4,616</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the nationalities of those in Direct Provision accommodation, the breakdown is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>INIS Reporting &amp;amp;

That Regulation is a mutual recognition instrument and does not seek to harmonise EU insolvency laws. In determining an application for the opening of an insolvency proceeding, for which it would have exclusive power as the primary proceedings, of a company or of a natural person, the Regulation requires that a court should determine the centre of main interest (COMI) of the applicant in the context of assuming jurisdiction.<br /><br />  It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed. For example, The UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected. Indeed, this has occurred with certain individuals, who were subsequently subject to insolvency proceedings in this jurisdiction. <br /><br />A company or natural person is entitled to change a COMI and could do so for the purposes, <i>inter alia</i>  of taking advantage of more favourable insolvency legislation. This entitlement arises under the broad rubric of freedom of movement in the Internal Market and such freedom has been enforced by decisions of the European Court of Justice. The country in which the debts are incurred is not necessarily material, but the relocation must not be artificial. The question of COMI is determined at the date the application for the insolvency proceeding is made and not at the time the debts were incurred. Orders made in insolvency proceedings in another EU jurisdiction, including an order discharging a person from bankruptcy, are enforceable against creditors elsewhere in the EU.<br /><br />  In response to the economic downturn across Europe, the EU has published a proposal to modernise cross-border insolvency law which seeks to make cross-border insolvency proceedings more efficient, benefiting both debtors and creditors throughout the EU.  One of the primary aims of the new Regulation will be to give potentially viable companies and entrepreneurs a second chance before being declared insolvent. The proposal also addresses a range of other insolvency issues. <br /><br />  I arranged that the initial discussion on the proposed Regulation took place at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of EU Justice Ministers held in Dublin Castle on the 17 and 18 of January last. The Ministers, including my British colleague, engaged in a very detailed and constructive discussion on the proposals contained in the Regulation. I emphasised the importance of a more uniform approach across the EU in regard to the establishment of the centre of main interest so as to combat potential abuses in this regard which have given rise to allegations of &quot;bankruptcy tourism&quot;. <br /><br />  Detailed consideration of the provisions contained in the new draft Regulation has now  commenced in a Working Group chaired by the Irish Presidency.</blockquote>  I have nothing further to add to that response other than to say that a first examination of the draft Regulation was concluded by the Council Working Group during the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

During the period 2003 to 2013, there have been 53 deaths of asylum seekers who were residing in direct provision accommodation prior to their deaths.</p><p>While RIA may have general knowledge of the cause of death - perhaps by way of information arising from the specified medical needs of the resident concerned prior to his or her death - it does not, indeed cannot, hold or have access to death certificates.  In most cases, the deaths would have occurred outside the asylum centres themselves e.g. in hospitals.  If the HSE or a Coroner were to raise an issue relating to the accommodation in which a deceased person lived prior to their death - and this has never happened - then RIA would respond accordingly.  Where information is provided to centre managers by relatives or friends of the deceased, this is recorded by RIA and indicates that the causes of death ranged from cancers, heart conditions to traffic accidents and, in the case of deaths of children under the age of five, it is believed that a number were suspected cot deaths and still births. It needs to be emphasised that these records are based on informal information and are not official records of death.</p><p>Given previous misinterpretations of statistics provided in this respect, it is important to say that only one of these deaths can with certainty be said to be a suicide and that involved a newly arrived asylum seeker taking his own life in 2008 while in hospital.</p><p>The number of asylum seekers who died between 2003 and 2013 while being provided with accommodation by RIA in direct provision centres is set out below.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Number of Deaths</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2003</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2004</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2005</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2006</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013 to date</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>53</div></td></tr></table></p><p>While all of these deaths are, of course, tragic, they need to be viewed proportionately and against the background that  RIA has provided accommodation for over 51,000 persons over the course of the twelve years the direct provision policy has been in place.</p><p>The above relates only to asylum seekers living in the Direct Provision system. Some asylum seekers choose not to avail of the Direct Provision system and stay with friends or relatives. It is possible that, during the period in question, there could have been deaths among this cohort but such data is not available to RIA.</p></reply>

Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.</p><p>  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.</p><p>  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the GCVU and this must remain the case.</p><p>  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

This is a complex issue with no single remedy, either legislative or administrative, and the constitutional protection afforded to the institution of marriage makes the possibility of effective criminal sanctions highly problematic.  However, the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill, which I hope to republish later this year, contains a number of provisions that would make it more difficult for persons engaging in a marriage of convenience to benefit from it in immigration terms.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, is likewise in the process of looking at possible changes to the Civil Registration Act in order to make such marriages more difficult to contract. These legislative steps should contribute to reducing the incentive to seek to engage in such marriages.</p></reply>

The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive a transfer to an Open Centre or temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect.</p><p>Prisoners serving short sentences, i.e. under 12 months, can be moved to an open centre shortly after committal. Other longer term prisoners being prepared for the transition back into the community can be considered for moves with about 2 years left in their sentence. Exceptional prisoners who are engaging strongly with the therapeutic services can sometimes be considered for a transfer with up to 4 years left to serve in their sentence.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that Open Centres and lower-level security settings are vital tools in the re-integration and rehabilitation of prisoners. They encourage an ethos of independent living and offer a transition between custody and community/family life.</p></reply>

Operational policing co-operation is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI and both have repeatedly emphasised that the close and high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and, indeed, in saving lives.</p><p>  I meet frequently and have ongoing discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, with regard to the security situation and the ongoing efforts to combat the threat from these gangs of criminal terrorists.  There is also a close and ongoing working relationship between our officials.

There are also a number of fora for discussion through which drugs issues of concern may be raised by the EU Member States on an ongoing basis including, for example, the Horizontal Drugs Group. In addition, the Member States recently agreed a EU Action Plan on Drugs for the period 2013-2016 which includes actions to raise awareness of the risks and consequences associated with the use of illicit drugs and other psychoactive substances.</p><p>  Furthermore through the mechanism of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, in place under our National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, any concerns with regard to the emergence of new trends or early warnings regarding drug use can be fed into the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction through the Irish focal point which resides in the Health Research Board. In addition, a HSE led early warning alert system to notify front-line health and drugs related services and the general public of drug use emergencies is in place.<b></b>  There are also state supported websites such as Drugs.ie which provide appropriate drugs information.</p><p>  Regarding the internet the Deputy may be aware that any suspected illegal content online may be reported by members of the public to the Hotline service at .  Where there is any concern that there is illegal activity being facilitated by a particular website this is a matter which should be reported to the Hotline service and/or to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The hotline is operated by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland (ISPAI) and it is overseen by the Office for Internet Safety, an Executive Office in my Department. The hotline provides a central point of contact for members of the public who become aware of child pornography or any other illegal content on the Internet in Ireland. The hotline accepts reports about such material and attempts to identify the source. If the material is hosted in Ireland, it will request the relevant internet service provider to remove it, in accordance with the ISPAI Code of Practice and Ethics. The hotline liaises with the Garda&iacute; as appropriate.</p><p>  To provide a fast response to illegal material that is hosted outside the Irish jurisdiction, the Hotline is a member of INHOPE, the international organisation of Internet Hotlines. Not all countries have an Internet hotline service and in cases where potentially illegal material is identified by the Hotline as located in such countries, it will forward the report to a specific contact point in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for transmission and action through international law enforcement channels.</p></reply>

In addition  the establishment of the Authority as a separate agency under the aegis of the Department of Defence (as proposed in the Bill) would involve additional costs in terms of staff, accommodation, expenses and payments to members of the Authority which would be significantly greater than the costs incurred by my Department in administering the Curragh Lands. This Government has targeted the rationalisation of State agencies as a key cost saving measure and in that context it would be inappropriate to establish a separate agency to manage work currently being done by my Department. The establishment of the Authority was the major proposal contained in the Bill.  Consequently I have no plans to review or re-publish the Bill. </p></reply>

These figures do not include 70 members of the PDF who are currently on Career Breaks or Leave of Absence.  This is against the stabilised strength for the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500.  In the context of the current strength being below the agreed stabilised strength, it is my intention that targeted recruitment will take place, within the resource envelope allocated to Defence, from the existing 2012 General Service Recruitment panels in the Autumn.  No decisions have yet been made with regard to General Service recruitment in 2014.</p><p>  A competition for the intake of Cadets was recently advertised, the closing date for which was 26 May 2013.

The cost of the two new ships is &euro;108m, exclusive of VAT.  In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on L.E. Roisin and L.E. Niamh, is &euro;7.8m, exclusive of VAT.  The two new ships are being built by Babcock Marine in Appledore, Devon in the United Kingdom, the same shipyard where both L.E. Roisin and L.E. Niamh were built.  The build programme for the first ship is on schedule.  The cutting of steel for the second ship has already commenced.  The two new ships will be larger vessels than L.E. Roisin and L.E. Niamh with a length of 89.5m.  The ships will have a top speed of 23 knots and will have a crew of 44 plus the capacity to take 10 trainees.</p><p>  The Naval Service will have a significant presence of experienced personnel in the Appledore Shipyard in the build up to the Harbour Acceptance Trials and the Sea Acceptance Trials on the ship scheduled to take place before the end of the year.  This will allow the required time for personnel to build up familiarity with the workings of the new ship.  As is the case with all new ships, the training process will continue when the ship arrives in the Naval Base in Cork and ongoing crew training will be part and parcel of normal patrolling.</p><p>  On the issue of the decommissioning of Naval Service ships, the process for the selection of a qualified person / company to assist the Department and the Naval Service with the sale / disposal of L.E. Emer and L.E. Aoife is still ongoing and I am not in a position to give further details on the matter at this stage.</p><p>  With regard to the change in naming policy for these new ships, I considered that the policy for naming Naval Service ships should be examined and I came to the view that the naming of the ships after world renowned Irish literary figures will facilitate greater recognition for our Naval Services when they are operating in the international maritime domain, particularly when they visit foreign ports.  I am also of the view that the time is right for a change in our traditional approach of naming ships after Irish female mythological figures to an approach which reflects a more modern and inclusive Ireland.</p></reply>

Under the building programme there has been considerable capital investment at the Curragh Camp in recent years.  Between 2008 and 2012 my Department has spend in excess of &euro;10.7 million on major building projects at the Camp with individual building projects costing in excess of &euro;1m as follows: New Armoured Vehicle Garaging; Refurbishment &amp;amp; Alterations to No. 4 Block, Plunkett Barracks; Refurbishment of Catering Centre, McDonagh Barracks; Refurbishment of Block 7, Connolly Barracks; Refurbishment of the Infantry School Building; Re-roofing of Military Medical Facility.</p><p>  The Defence capital works provision has reduced over the last 5 years, from &euro;25.6m in 2008 to &euro;6.24m in 2013.  The reduction in funding of 75.6% has significantly impacted on the number and scale of construction projects which it is now possible to undertake in any given year.  Notwithstanding the constraints on the capital budget as outlined above, plans are presently being progressed for the provision of substantial additional facilities at the Camp as follows: The refurbishment of the ammunition depot so as to bring the complex into line with modern standards for such facilities; The conversion to natural gas consumption of the major energy consuming facilities in the camp.  This is expected to generate significant savings when completed.</p><p>  Expenditure on minor works, such as the resurfacing of roads and squares and refurbishment works, including the painting of buildings, is treated as current expenditure under the Building programme.  Given the overall size of the Camp and the distribution and variety of buildings located within it, a significant portion of the budget for these works is expended on buildings located at the Camp.  As with the Building capital budget, the provision for such works has also been in decline in recent years, down from &euro;14.95m in 2008 to &euro;7.460 for 2013.</p><p>  In relation to the married quarters housing stock, my Department has discontinued the practice of providing such accommodation as it has been found that over time the properties require a significant and disproportionate investment in order to ensure compliance with regulations regarding rental properties.  Consequently in recent years there has been a sharp decline in the number of such properties in use with only 27 serving personnel currently occupying married quarters in the Curragh.  Where such properties are located outside barracks, they are made available for purchase.  Properties located within barracks are not for sale and are removed from the stock of available housing when they become vacant.  There are no residential properties (former married quarters) vacant in the Curragh Camp which are currently habitable.  From time to time the overall stock of housing within the barracks is reviewed and vacant uninhabitable properties are demolished where it is found to be necessary due to health and safety concerns, to make way for other facilities or in order to improve the layout of the camp generally.</p></reply>

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem.</p><p>   Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.  It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.  It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if all stakeholders work in a co-operative basis.  If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment.  If this is allowed to happen, Ireland will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife.  While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the achievement of this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders.  Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons.  It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels.  Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.</p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat.  An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC.  The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including: Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming; Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands.  The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.  There are other issues that will need to be considered.  These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.  While it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed in the near future.</p></reply>

However, Article 19 of the Agreement obliges signatories to "undertake to continue their efforts with a view to achieving progressive liberalization of agricultural trade".  A bilateral agreement was drawn up in 2012, which established additional trade preferences in agricultural products.</p><p>  However, from January 2013, Norway changed its tariff structure, from specific tariffs to ad valorem tariffs, on certain types of cheese, lamb and beef, which has led to significant increases in tariffs for these products being exported from the EU to Norway.  While Norway can legally do this under its WTO obligations, nevertheless, the measures are regarded as contrary to Article 19 of the EEA Agreement, which foresees progressive trade liberalisation in agriculture.</p><p>  Officials from my Department met with Norwegian officials on 10 December, 2012 and raised concerns at the decision by Norway to introduce these higher tariffs and specifically the impact these higher tariffs could have on potential exports of Irish beef to Norway, which was being explored by the beef industry.  My officials also highlighted the fact that no prior notice had been given to the Commission of the proposed changes to the tariff structure.</p><p>  The Commission has taken all available measures to counter the tariff increases.  Letters were sent by the Director-General of DG AGRI and Commissioner Cioloş to oppose the new tariffs.  Consultations with Norway took place at political and technical level.  The issue was raised at the EAA Joint Committee.  Nevertheless  , Norway was not willing to reconsider the measures taken.  The Commission recognises that this action is allowed within Norway&rsquo;s WTO commitments but it is considering what can be done bilaterally and has indicated that it will also take this into account in other areas of its relations with Norway. Last week, a resolution was adopted by MEPs demanding that Norway withdraw what it regards as protectionist measures, and warned that the EU will consider &quot;further action&quot; if Norway does not comply.</p><p>  In terms of trade with Norway, Ireland&rsquo;s exports of food and beverages have increased from &euro;13.13m in 2010, to &euro;16.644m in 2011 and to &euro;17.557m in 2012.  We will have to await the full year figures for 2013 to see if this measure has impacted on Ireland&rsquo;s exports of beef and cheese.  Exports of beverages, at roughly &euro;10m over the past three years have remained almost constant in these years.  Exports of dairy products have varied from &euro;1.08m in 2010, to &euro;3.4m in 2011 and &euro;2.9m in 2012.  Ireland has very limited cheese exports to Norway which were valued at &euro;85,000 in 2011 and &euro;32,000 in 2012.  Exports of casein increased slightly from &euro;1.08m in 2011 to &euro;1.15m in 2012 while exports of butter decreased from &euro;2.2 m to &euro;1.65m.  Exports of cereals have grown from &euro;55,000 in 2010 to &euro;1.54m in 2012, while pigmeat exports increased from &euro;99,000 in 2011 to &euro;211,000 in 2012.  Exports of beef also grew from a zero base in 2011 to &euro;200,000 in 2012.</p><p>  For the first four months of this year, there is a decrease in Irish exports from &euro;5.88m to &euro;4.08, with reductions recorded in relation to cereals exports from &euro;1.23m to &euro;19,000 and also decreases in exports of dairy products from &euro;918,000 to &euro;303,000.  No exports of beef are recorded in the first four months of 2012 and none are recorded in the first four months of 2013.  My Department will continue to monitor this situation and will support the Commission in its actions to address the measures taken by Norway.</p></reply>

I clearly stated at both meetings and on many occasions since both in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required. I confirmed with both interested parties that it is my job to seek the earliest possible date that would allow for the growing of beet again for the production of sugar in Ireland.</p><p>  I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed.</p><p>  Also my Department officials have met with both feasibility study groups on a number of occasions since then to brief them on the progress of the CAP reform negotiations in Brussels, which included measures for a revised sugar regime and meetings with both interested groups are ongoing.</p><p>  I am now pleased to confirm to the Deputy that at our final Council of Agriculture Ministers in June, which I chaired under Ireland's EU Presidency, and following very comprehensive and extensive discussions which I had with my ministerial colleagues from all the Member States on this issue, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package to abolish all EU sugar quotas by 30 September 2017. This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the sugar quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-commence sugar processing.</p><p>  This agreement has been welcomed by those who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.</p></reply>

My Department transferred responsibility for maintaining the Irish Horse Register (Irish Sport Horse and Irish Draught studbooks) to HSI in July 2008. My Department is required to ensure that HSI are operating as required under EU and National legislation for registered equidae in regard to maintaining these studbooks. HSI conducts a comprehensive breed improvement programme for the Irish Sport Horse and Irish Draught breeds.</p><p>  The HSI Breeding Sub Board Committee has the responsibility for formulating breeding policies for the Irish Draught studbook. Members of this Sub Board Committee are nominated and elected by breeders from five electoral regions.</p><p>  In 2008, HSI initiated a strategic review in order to make improvements to the breeding programmes of the Irish Draught Horse. As part of this overall strategy, HSI developed a revised breeding programme for the Irish Draught Horse with the assistance of an Irish Draught Task Force. The Task Force included representatives of Irish Draught breeders which were chosen by HSI for their knowledge of Irish Draught breeding, rather than for their affiliation to any organization. The review included lengthy consultation with all involved in the industry and the Irish Draught Breeding Policy was published in 2010.</p><p>  In the current year HSI are initiating a review of this Irish Draught Breeding Policy in order to determine the effectiveness of the policy and make any amendments to the policy which would be in the best interest of the breed. To assist this process, an Irish Draught Breeding Policy Review Taskforce is being established. As part of the review process submissions will be sought from groups or individual breeders regarding the current breeding policy for the Irish Draught with key areas of interest to include the breeding objective for the Studbook, the classification system, inspection system and suggestions for studbook initiatives to improve the quality and marketing of the breed.</p></reply>

Over the coming days I will be adding to that information.  One of the main features of this agreement on the CAP is the amount of flexibility it gives to Member States to implement the common policy in a way that addresses the particular needs and specificities of individual Member States.</p><p>  Specifically in regard to the redistribution of direct payments within Member States, the agreement provides options for Member States to converge fully or partially to uniform rates of payment per hectare by 2019.  The partial convergence option is based largely on a model originally proposed by Ireland whereby farmers with payments below 90% of the national or regional average would have their payments raised by at least one third of the difference between their current payment and 90% of the national or regional average.  This would be financed by reductions to payments above the national average payment per hectare and would be subject to a minimum payment of 60% of the national or regional payment per hectare. There is an optional provision to limit losses from convergence to a maximum of 30% and Member States have flexibility to decide how payment reductions are applied to those above the average.  Member States also have the option to apply the greening payment at a rate of 30% of a farmer&rsquo;s individual payment rather than a flat rate.  As an add-on to either the flat rate or partial convergence models, there is provision for an optional redistributive payment on up to 30 hectares or the national average farm size, if higher.</p><p>  In Ireland's case, I have made no secret of the fact that we should go the partial convergence route in a way that continues to support productive farmers while bringing more equity and fairness into the distribution of direct payment funds.  Nevertheless, there are many open questions remaining about the extent to which payments should converge, whether we should adopt a regional approach, how we should finance the convergence and whether we should avail of the add-on redistributive payment.</p><p>  I will be launching a consultation process shortly to obtain the views of all stakeholders regarding the many options open to Ireland for implementation of the new regime.</p></reply>

This latter requirement is an essential part of the food-chain information under EU food law.</p><p>  With regard to horses that can no longer fulfil the purpose for which they were bred , my Department supports the option of humane disposal where an owner can no longer adequately provide for the animal as such action will help prevent the emergence of long-term animal welfare problems. As a further support for dealing with potential surplus horses, my officials have sought the EU Commission opinion on the possible use of horsemeat in petfood. Such an initiative could help to provide an outlet for horses which are not eligible for the food chain, thereby encouraging owners to dispose of unwanted horses. In addition, my Department provides funding to Local Authorities under the Control of Horses Act, 1996, to enable these bodies implement their wide ranging powers relating to the control and welfare of stray or abandoned horses. The Local authorities are humanely disposing of a considerable number of these horses under these arrangements on an on-going basis.</p><p>  On the question of implementing a testing regime similar to that employed for imported horse meat from the US bound for human consumption, the position is that there is no direct importation of horsemeat into the EU from the USA. The slaughter of horses for human consumption within the US ceased in 2006. I understand, however, that live horses are exported from the US for slaughter in both Canada and Mexico. Some of this meat is then exported to the EU. The regulations relating to the import of meat from third countries are set at EU rather than at domestic level and are outlined in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. The third country of dispatch, together with the individual establishment from which the product is dispatched, must be on an approved list and these lists are published on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website. There is also a requirement that imports of meat are only allowed from countries with an approved residue monitoring plan.</p><p>  Equine carcases are regularly sampled as part of the National Residue Control Plan and testing is carried out for a wide range of substances including veterinary medicines. Additional tests were carried out this Spring under an EU Commission sponsored testing programme for phenylbutazone (commonly known as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;). These found 16 positives from 3,115 tests carried out across the EU. In Ireland, of the 840 tests carried out by my Department under this programme, just one was positive.

This relief, which is more commonly known as &#8220;retirement relief&#8221;, continues to be available having been in place for many years. Qualifying assets relevant to farming include:</p><p>  - The chargeable business asset of the individual which he/she has owned for at least ten years up to the disposal date and which have been his/her chargeable business assets throughout the 10 years.</p><p>  - Land leased under the Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming, where for a period of not less than 10 years prior to the land being leased it was owned by the person claiming relief and was farmed by him throughout that period.</p><p>  - Land which was let at any time in the 15 years before disposal but, prior to its first letting, was farmed for 10 years by the owner and the disposal is to a child.</p><p>  There are two separate elements to this type of CGT relief:<blockquote>a)  <b>Disposal of a business or a farm to one's child;</b>  Irrespective of the amount of consideration for the disposal, full relief may be claimed by a person on the disposal to his child. If the child disposes of the asset within 6 years clawback applies. To incentivise earlier lifetime transfer of holdings it was announced in Budget 2012 that, from January 2014, the amount of full relief in the case of transfers to children will be reduced from an unlimited amount to &euro;3 million for those aged over 66 years of age, but will be retained at the unlimited level for those aged 55-66 years. A two year lead in period for these changes was put in place to allow for an orderly transition.b)  <b>Disposal of a business or farm to a person other than one's child;</b>  Where the consideration is less that &euro;750,000 there is full relief for those aged over 55 years. Where the consideration is over &euro;750,000 marginal relief is available which reduces the CGT payable to an amount equal to half the excess over &euro;750,000. Budget 2012 introduced from January 2014 onwards a lowering of the amount of full relief in these cases from &euro;750,000 to &euro;500,000 for those aged over 66 years of age. The level will be retained at the 750,000 level for those aged 55-66 years.</blockquote>  Budget 2012 also introduced new lower stamp duty rates for land transfers with a 1% rate now applicable to transfers to close relations until the end of 2014.  The 1% rate is half the rate applicable to non-family transfers. In addition Budget 2013 extended the longstanding 100% relief on stamp duty for land transfers to certain young trained farmers for a further period of three years until end of 2015.</p><p>  The range of tax measures applicable to the agricultural sector announced in recent Budgets reflect the Government's commitment to supporting younger farmers through encouraging earlier inter-generational transfer of farm holdings and minimising the costs associated with transfer of farm holdings. These measures have created a positive environment for structural change to occur and will help facilitate meeting the ambitious expansion targets planned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p><p>  The issue of further changes to these reliefs in the future is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Finance and I will continue to liaise closely with Minister Noonan in relation to possible taxation measures linked to policy priorities in my Department.</p></reply>

These bans had been in place for well over a decade because of legacy concerns related to scrapie and BSE. This is a clear signal from the Gulf States of their confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s rigorous controls and excellent standards of food safety. While Saudi Arabia had previously lifted a ban on the importation of Irish beef and the UAE had lifted the ban on Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry, the formal lifting of the GCC-wide ban means that Ireland is free to complete the formalities necessary to export Irish beef and lamb within the GCC as a whole.</p><p>  This region has a combined population of almost 43.5 million with high levels of disposable income, a significant food deficit and a taste for beef and lamb, and presents an important opportunity for the Irish beef and lamb sectors, in particular at the premium food service and retail end of the market. This is exactly the kind of market opportunity that can add value to the Irish meat sector and help to build the reputation of the Irish food sector for high standards of quality and safety. My Department has already commenced the process needed to agree beef and sheepmeat certs with Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain and a sheepmeat cert with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>  I also announced last week that I will be leading a trade mission to the Gulf region from 27 October to 1 November this year, to draw attention to Ireland and what it can offer to the very discerning customers in this region and to explore future opportunities.  I look forward to this mission and to highlighting the unique qualities of Irish food production and products. During this visit I will of course thank the GCC for their decision and raise the subject of meat access to this region, amongst other issues.</p></reply>

Spurdog spawning biomass is currently at the lowest observed level, although stable in recent years.  Spurdog is a long-lived, slow growing, and late maturing species and therefore is particularly vulnerable to fishing mortality.  ICES advise is that there should be no target fishery and that by catch in mixed fisheries should be reduced to the lowest possible level.  It recommends that a rebuilding plan should be developed for this stock.  The Marine Institute supports ICES advice and further notes that spatial avoidance measures should be put in place to avoid large catches of accidental by-catch.  On the basis of the scientific advice, there does not appear to be a case for the re-opening of a commercial fishery for spurdog at this time.</p></reply>

The Philippines does not grant inter country adoption to prospective adoptive parents residing in Ireland. Prospective adoptive parents who chose the Philippines as their country of origin are advised to seek independent legal advice prior to deciding to do so. There are a number of complex legal and constitutional issues to be considered.

The placement of the child may be contrary to Irish legislation (i.e. it may be considered a 'private' placement)</p><p>  2.

Prospective adoptive parents can rarely, if ever, secure the statutory consents required for under Irish legislation.</p><p>  In consideration of the above, applications for domestic Adoption Order for child born brought in from the Philippines invariably end up in the High Court at considerable cost to the Health Service Executive. </p><p>  Correspondence from the Health Service Executive, on 1 July 2013 states</p><p><i>'In relation to placements of children from the Philippines, it is unreasonable and unsustainable that the Health Service Executive should have to fund High Court applications for the dispensing of parental consents.

The Health Service Executive will meet the cost of any current application that commenced prior to the making of this decision.'</i></p><p>  Prospective adoptive parents proposing to adopt from the Philippines should contact their local Health Service Executive Regional Adoption Service to discuss this important issue.

We agreed that the matter would be prioritised in due course following completion of my Department's work on the Children's Referendum, submission of the State's next report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the setting up of the new Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  The criminal law elements of the Optional Protocol have largely been implemented by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008. Legislative proposals to further protect children against sexual exploitation are at an advanced stage of preparation.  The Minister for Justice and Equality expects to bring these legislative proposals to Government shortly. It is also proposed to put in place the necessary administrative procedures and arrangements to allow for accession and, subject to the advice of the Attorney General's Office, it is proposed to ratify the Optional Protocol as soon as is practicable.</p><p>  I have previously stated that it was my intention to sign the Third Optional Protocol on behalf of Ireland as soon as possible. My Department now has finalised and submitted to Government for approval the State's combined 3rd and 4th Reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child . Subject to Government approval the report will be submitted to the UN Committee. I expect to consult with other Government departments shortly and seek the approval of the Government to the signing of the third Optional Protocol on behalf of Ireland.  Ratification would generally take place some time after that, once the State is satisfied that the necessary legislative and administrative procedures are in place to enable full compliance. This matter will be assessed by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and other Government departments.</p></reply>

The HSE published a composite report of the 3 pilots on 20 June 2013. A decision was taken within the HSE to produce this composite report as the best means of disseminating the learning from the three projects.  The decision to publish a composite report, along with the time taken by the HSE to ensure that all of the recommendations are being actioned, were factors in determining the publication date of the report.</p><p>  From the outset, it was the intention of the HSE that the neglect audit would comprise a number of phases and that the initial pilot phase would inform a more significant National Audit of Neglect Cases.  Therefore the audit published in June last was not simply a once off exercise but constitutes one element of a wider process to improve practice in relation to such cases across the country. Phase 1 of this process was the initial audits undertaken by Ms Lynne Peyton, Consultant in Children&rsquo;s Services and Social Care. Phase 2 will comprise a series of workshops for social work staff and managers nationwide. There will be a minimum of two workshops in each region presented by Ms Peyton in conjunction with Ms Helen Buckley, who will be covering the learning emerging from the Child Death Review Process. These workshops are scheduled to begin in Autumn 2013 and will be followed by the phase 3 National Audit of all neglect files which will be informed by the findings of phase 1 and the outcomes of the phase 2 workshops.  A definitive timeline for completion of phases 2 and 3 is dependent on completion of phase 2 at regional level and thereafter individual local audits.  It follows that different regions will complete their audits at different times. My Department will be liaising with the HSE over the coming months to monitor progress.</p><p>  As regards consultations, these have been exclusively with officials in the HSE around progressing to the next phases of the audit process. Any issues emerging as the audit process proceeds will be raised through the interdepartmental Children First Implementation Group.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-16a.2550.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013071600090#WRFFF00700"><p>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I recently announced a number of measures as part of my response to the distressing events highlighted in the Prime Time programme.  </p><p>  It is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector starting in September 2014.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the ECCE programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.</p><p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  </p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   </p><p>As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance vis a vis minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  </p><p>In relation to the publication of pre-school service inspection reports, the HSE Pre-School Inspectorate is working to put these online.  I gave a commitment to have new reports, <b>once completed</b>, put online from 1 July 2013 and to have all reports available online as soon as possible.  My Department is supporting the HSE and Pobal in this work, and I understand that the first of these reports has recently been placed online.    </p><p>  A new registration system will be introduced in September of this year and new services wishing to open will be required to register with the HSE.  The HSE will determine whether the childcare service is compliant in terms suitability and service design before the service will be permitted to operate.  Following commencement of the service, actual care and welfare practices will be inspected.</p><p>  My Department is currently developing a new Children and Young People's Policy Framework which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later this year and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland's first Children's Strategy which was published in 2000. This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.</p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. </p></reply>

The code of practice was developed to improve transparency in the industry. Every member company will have to disclose or document the names of the healthcare professionals or associations who have received payments or something else of value on their websites. The disclosed information will also include the payment amount as well as the type of financial relationship which will affect consultancy and congress fees and travel payments. EFPIA members must adhere to this code in order to remain in this trade body.</p><p>  Section 59.8 of the Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners advises Medical Practitioners that &quot;You must keep up to date with developments in medication safety. You should not rely solely or excessively on promotional literature distributed by pharmaceutical companies for information about particular drugs. You should seek independent evidence-based sources of information on the benefits and risks associated with medicines before prescribing&quot;.</p><p>  The HSE has been working with GPs over many years to encourage better quality prescribing of drugs in Ireland. In 2012, the HSE's Medicines Management Programme  was established and one of its key tasks is to communicate with prescribers regarding best practice. </p><p>  The Programme has identified 'preferred drugs' for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients. This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative. PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol. The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin. The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15 million for the taxpayer. </p><p>  A further initiative underway to assist with GP prescribing is the launch of the HSE's Prescribing Guidance System (PGS). This system supports prescribers with integrated 'point of prescribing' information making it easier for GPs to make decisions in line with MMP prescribing guidance. In turn, the system also gives assurance regarding the effectiveness of prescribing guidance interventions.</p><p>  It is anticipated that this prescribing guidance system will be a critical assistance to the GP community and significantly important to the wider health system.</p><p>  Furthermore, the ESRI report <i>Pharmaceutical Prices, Prescribing Practices and Usage of Generics in a Comparative Context, </i>which was published on the 27th of June recommended that &quot;...financial incentives to reduce pharmaceutical expenditure should not be introduced for medical practitioners in Ireland&quot;. The Department of Health and the HSE agree with this recommendation and no such incentives are in place.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis. The amount payable is the net difference between the costs to the Irish health services of providing care to those with only UK entitlements and the cost to the UK health services of providing services to those with only Irish entitlements.  The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.</p><p>  By far the largest part of the net payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland.  The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable was based on a survey by both administrations undertaken every three years, the most recent of which was completed in 2008.  Recently both administrations agreed in principle to work towards a form of pensioner registration which will form the basis for calculating pensioner reimbursement costs in the future and agreed interim arrangements, based on previous survey results trends, for determining pensioner liability pending the implementation of same.</p><p>  The amounts are received by the Health Service Executive as Appropriations-in-Aid and are offset against the gross funding requirements of the Executive at national level thus reducing the net liability to the Exchequer. </p><p>  The amounts received by Ireland from the UK in respect of reimbursement of healthcare costs provided under Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, for the years in question are -</p><p>  2011	- &euro;270,000,000.</p><p>  2012	- &euro;220,000,000.</p></reply>

This is done in a number of ways such as by providing grant-aid to support pre-school provision in community pre-schools and by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  It also facilitates children with special needs to attend mainstream pre-school by providing the necessary assistant supports.  The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with special needs involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector and with the parents and families of the children in question.</p><p>  With regard to the HSE's Speech and Language Therapy Service, I understand that each individual that presents to the Service has an initial assessment to determine their individual need for therapy.  The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual&rsquo;s difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. </p><p>  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents /carers so that they can work to help improve the individual&rsquo;s speech and language. In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate. The HSE has stated that it is committed to working in partnership with other service providers to achieve maximum benefits for children and adults with speech and language therapy requirements, and aims to ensure that, the speech and language therapy resources available are used in the most effective manner possible. </p><p>  My Department has asked the HSE to look at the specific operational service issue of waiting times for therapeutic input at the Wellmount Heathcare facility and to respond directly to the Deputy on the matter.  </p></reply>

Approval has issued all four HSE Regions to enable recruitment to commence.  As at end June 2013, 117 of the 477 posts approved in 2013 had been accepted by candidates and are awaiting clearance with a further 34 posts offered to candidates.  </p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Recruitment Service (NRS) creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.  On occasion however, it is difficult to fill some posts for various reasons including geographical location, international shortage of some grades, most notably clinical Psychologists etc.     The NRS is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, from existing panels or through competition in the absence of panels, at the earliest opportunity.  I have been assured by the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013, and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012, is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  The &euro;35 million allocation for mental health this year also includes &euro;400,000 to support a national project to prepare a business case for a national mental health ICT system and to seek the necessary resources to identify and implement such a system.  The HSE is currently carrying out the necessary preparatory work in this regard.</p><p>  With regard to the level of funding for mental health next year, this is being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2014. </p></reply>

It is also a concern that the Inspector found that overall compliance with regulation, rules and codes of practice in 2012 can only be regarded as fair with no significant improvement on previous years.  High standards in facilities and in in-patient care must be the norm without exception.  The aim is to further develop mental health services that are recovery oriented and that put service users, their families and carers at the centre. In this regard, I welcome the commitment in the HSE National Service Plan to improve the quality of mental health services in line with the requirements of the Mental Health Commission. </p><p>  The recruitment of the additional 900 WTEs for mental health and the appointment by the HSE of a new Director for Mental Health will pave the way for a significant change in the management and delivery of our mental health services and will be a key step towards remedying many of the problems identified by the Inspector for Mental Health Services.</p></reply>

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU, together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, has developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset.  This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan. The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

The objective is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners (GPs), nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and others.  At the end of May 2013, there were 418<b></b>  Primary Care Teams operating, i.e. holding clinical team meetings, involving GPs and HSE staff.  The HSE's 2013 National Service Plan commits to having 484 operational Teams in place by the end of this year.</p><p>  In 2012, the HSE completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of public health nurses, registered general nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the HSE's 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.</p><p>  Based on this exercise, in 2013, Primary Care funding of &euro;20 million, nationally, will be invested to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and enhance the capacity of the primary care sector.</p><p>  I issued approval to the HSE on the 27th March 2013 to commence recruitment to Primary Care Teams with immediate effect of the following additional 251 Primary Care posts:</p><p>-   70 Public Health Nurses;</p><p>-  37 Registered General Nurses; </p><p>-  51 Occupational Therapists; </p><p>-  46 Physiotherapists; and </p><p>-  47 Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists.</p><p>  The allocation and distribution of the above posts is based on bringing each Integrated Service Area, where staffing is below the national average, towards the national average.  </p><p>  This Government recognised the pivotal role that Primary Care has in addressing the mental health needs of the population and committed in the Programme for Government to the provision of counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.  Budget 2012 provided a special allocation of &euro;35 million for mental health from which &euro;5m was made available for the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems who are eligible under the General Medical Services.  A further &euro;2.5 million was made available from this year's special allocation for mental health.  Ten Counsellor Coordinators, who will be responsible for the set-up, roll-out, management and monitoring of the service, have now been appointed.  </p><p>  Last week, I was delighted to join my colleague, the Minister with responsibility for Mental Health, Kathleen Lynch, T.D, at the launch of the Counselling in Primary Care Initiative.  This Initiative will be working to improve access to counselling to people with mild to moderate psychological difficulties who are medical card holders under the General Medical Services Scheme.</p><p>  It is expected that the start date for the service will vary according to when the Counsellor Coordinator takes up the post but the first services will begin to roll-out this month.</p></reply>

In 2012, the HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme  was established and one of its key tasks is to communicate with prescribers regarding best practice. </p><p>  The Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients. This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative. PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol. The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin. The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15 million for the taxpayer. </p><p>  A further initiative underway to assist with GP prescribing is the launch of the HSE&rsquo;s Prescribing Guidance System (PGS). This system supports prescribers with integrated 'point of prescribing' information making it easier for GPs to make decisions in line with MMP prescribing guidance. In turn, the system also gives assurance regarding the effectiveness of prescribing guidance interventions.</p><p>  It is anticipated that this prescribing guidance system will be a critical assistance to the GP community and significantly important to the wider health system.</p></reply>

No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive, provides for:</p><p>  - A maximum 48 hour average working week;</p><p>  - A 30 minute rest break every 6 hours during period on-site on-call;</p><p>  - 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work;</p><p>  - 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.</p><p>  The Government is committed to achieving compliance with the European Working Time Directive in respect of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) by 2014. I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue, and also the need to address NCHDs working conditions more generally.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive's Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address EWTD compliance in the short-term.  Key objectives in 2013 are a reduction of average weekly hours worked and a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken. </p><p>  The HSE has established a National Group to bring a clear and urgent focus to: implementation of the Directive, assessment of performance and site-by-site accountability for change.  The objective is to achieve compliance by the end of 2014.  The Group has engaged with management in each hospital regarding implementation plans and accountability.  The immediate focus is to ensure that no doctor works more than 68 hours per week and that none work shifts (including on-call) of longer than 24 hours at a time. </p><p>  The HSE is also conscious of the need to implement other measures to improve the working conditions of NCHDs, including protection of training time, the implementation of formal bleep policies and the transfer of tasks often inappropriately undertaken by NCHDs to more appropriate staff.</p><p>  I am keeping this matter under ongoing review so as to ensure that the HSE, to the maximum extent possible, reduces the average working hours of NCHDs and implements other measures to improve their working conditions. Progressing compliance is a key priority which will in turn facilitate the provision of improved and safer delivery of services to patients.</p></reply>

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. </p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal service within this term. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. </p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I have updated the Taoiseach on this matter and we expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  </p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>  To conclude,this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.</p></reply>

The Strategy addressed the rapidly rising burden of cancer in the Irish population and includes recommendations in relation to the reorganisation of cancer services, promoting health and preventing cancer.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in many areas of cancer control, particularly screening, cancer care in the acute setting and primary care since the launch of the Strategy.  The National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) introduced a programmatic approach to cancer services in 2007, as laid out in the Strategy.  Its aim is to improve cancer prevention, detection, treatment, increase survival rates and improve quality of life. This is currently being achieved through the development of a comprehensive national service, based on evidence and best practice. Cancer services are now centralised around 8 Designated Cancer Centres established in four managed cancer networks.    Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) are in place for the more common site specific cancer, with linkages between designated cancer centres and hospitals for MDT discussion.  Work continues to ensure that, for all cancer, initial diagnosis and surgery will be provided at the cancer centres by multidisciplinary teams.</p><p>  The NCCP's Community Oncology programme has made considerable progress in working with GPs to enhance their role.  The NCCP has developed national GP referral guidelines and standard referral forms for breast, lung, and prostate cancers, making the referral process more seamless, safer and more efficient.  It has also developed electronic cancer referral for breast, prostate and lung cancer, in collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders.  This ensures rapid referral of patients with suspected cancer in a secure manner.  </p><p>  BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme and CervicalCheck, the National Cervical Screening Programme are available nationwide to eligible women.   There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to extend BreastCheck to the 65-69 age group.  BowelScreen, the National Colorectal Screening Programme has been introduced on a phased basis. </p><p>  New radiation oncology facilities at St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital were completed and opened under Phase 1 of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology (NPRO) in 2011. The new centres reflect the latest advances, equipment and expertise available internationally and deliver a 50% increase in the number of linear accelerators in the Greater Dublin area.  Phase 2 of the NPRO will address future needs and will provide additional capacity in Cork, Galway and the Greater Dublin area.  New facilities will come on stream in Cork in Quarter 4 2016, and in Galway in Quarter 2 2017.</p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) function assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of the medicines, devices, diagnostics, and health interventions in the health system.   A number of HTAs have been conducted by HIQA on aspects of cancer services.</p><p>  In relation to promoting health, major advances have been made in progressing work on a number of initiatives including a new national framework for action to improve health and wellbeing 'Healthy Ireland', Tobacco Control, Substance Abuse and Obesity. </p><p>  &lsquo;Healthy Ireland&rsquo; is a response to the many risks that threaten Ireland's future health and wellbeing.  It was launched in April 2013 with the aim of improving the health and wellbeing of our country over the coming generation.  'Healthy Ireland' will support a whole-of-government approach to address the determinants and predictors of health and wellbeing.</p><p>  A range of measures have been introduced to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Ireland:  Regulations to introduce combined text and photo warnings on tobacco products came into force in February 2013; work is progressing on the development of legislation on plain packaging, the objective is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive to consumers and to make health warnings more prominent.  The Report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group is at an advanced stage of preparation. The Group is considering a number of issues including the feasibility and possibility of extending the smoking ban to other areas e.g., playgrounds, parks, beaches etc.</p><p>  I supported a Private Members Bill in the Seanad in May 2012 relating to prohibiting smoking in cars with children present.  My Department is working with the Senators in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Department of Justice in progressing this legislation.  In December 2012, the European Commission published a proposal for a new EU Tobacco Products Directive, the ultimate purpose of which is to reduce the numbers of people smoking.  The proposal is being discussed in the European Parliament and Council of Ministers and the Commission hope to have it adopted in 2014.  I am fully supportive of the measures outlined in the proposal.  </p><p>  Real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the National Substance Misuse Strategy report 2012. These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including legislation on minimum unit pricing; the advertising of alcohol; sponsorship; labelling of alcohol products; and prevention and intervention activities on alcohol. </p><p>  A Special Action Group on Obesity has been established.  I meet regularly with the Group to progress the obesity prevention agenda.  The Special Action Group on Obesity comprises key stakeholders and is chaired by the Department of Health. It is recognised that alone no single initiative will reverse this growing trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in implementing the recommendations in the 2006 Strategy.  The quality of services has improved hugely in recent years, mainly due to the concerted efforts of the NCCP.  My Department will continue to work with the HSE, clinicians and others, such as voluntary organisations, to ensure that outcomes for cancer are improved.</p></reply>

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU, together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, has developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset.  This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan. The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p> The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013,</i>   has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p><p>  In relation to the specific hospital queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

It will deliver a number of important benefits, including </p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, </p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,</p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available. The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 November and further price reductions were implemented on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  	The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE requires a generic medicine to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.</p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, will introduce a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines. They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p><p>  It is expected that the first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, will be published in mid-August at which time generic prices will fall by 20%. The IMB will publish subsequent lists for other groups of medicines on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  The Act also provides that the HSE may set a reference price for each group of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price is expected to be implemented by November. </p></reply>

The scheme will enable the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurses positions for two years.  It will support the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited. </p><p>  The nursing unions were strongly opposed to the scheme and, as a result, the number of staff appointed to date has been limited.  At this stage 18 applicants have been assigned to work locations and have taken up their posts.  A further 48 applicants have accepted offers but have yet to take up duty. Under the Haddington Road Agreement it has been agreed that higher salary rates will be payable to participants in this scheme and in this context the relevant unions have withdrawn their opposition to its implementation.  </p><p>  The HSE will shortly be proceeding to invite further applications and to facilitate qualified applicants with offers of appointment to posts in the part of the country for which they have expressed a preference.   Recruitment will continue during 2013, with a particular focus on nurses who will be graduating next autumn. A savings target of &euro;10m was factored into the HSE's budget for 2013. It is too early at this point to assess whether this level of saving will be achieved.</p><p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved the Graduate Nurse Placement Initiative on the basis that participants would not be counted in health service staff numbers and that it would contribute to savings on unsustainable levels of agency and overtime expenditure.   Appointments under the scheme will, accordingly, be made strictly for a two year period. It will be open to participants to compete in the normal way for appointment to a permanent post in the health service, in the event of recruitment to such positions taking place.</p></reply>

My priority is to ensure that those affected by narcolepsy, with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with a range of services and supports to meet their health needs.  Both myself and officials from my Department, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills have met with the relevant advocacy group on a number of occasions, to address their concerns and to outline the services available. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.   </p><p>These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.      </p><p>The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 17 May 2013.  Through regional co-ordinators the HSE also has frequent contact with individual members of SOUND to assist them in service access and reimbursement of expenses.   The HSE recently held an information day for staff, also attended by SOUND, to ensure awareness of all the relevant services available.    My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.   I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter continues to be a priority for my Department.  </p></reply>

This includes management of this particular facility as part of a single mental health service across Galway and Roscommon, which also encompasses similar acute units at Ballinasloe and Galway. In circumstances where one of these units reaches maximum operational capacity, for whatever reason, then incoming patients receive treatment in one of the other units.  This is normal practice in acute mental health provision nationally. </p><p>        It should be emphasised that addressing relevant issues at this facility can only be viewed in the context of wider changes in the health service, including in the mental health area, and the need to provide in the future the most appropriate and best possible service at this Unit, in line with agreed mental health policy and service norms applicable elsewhere. This process is currently being undertaken by the HSE and will obviously have to take account of all relevant options, including the type of unit proposed in the Deputy's question.  </p><p>        I have been closely monitoring developments on the issue raised, and I met with officials from the Executive on 10th July last to review the evolving situation.

In line with the legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with cancer, or any other specific illness. There has been no change in entitlement in this regard.</p><p>  The processing of medical cards at a national level ensures that all people are treated in a similar, fair manner. While people with specific illnesses such as cancer are not automatically entitled to medical cards, the legislation provides for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account when determining whether there is &quot;undue hardship&quot; for a person in providing a health service for himself or herself or his or her dependants.</p><p>  At the request of the Minister for Health, the HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for such discretionary medical cards, where there are difficult personal circumstances. This procedure ensures that the specific situation of a person with a particular diagnosis, such as one of the many forms of cancer, can be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>  The HSE also has a separate procedure in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. Emergency medical cards are issued by the HSE within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.</p><p>  The arrangement differs for persons with a terminal illness. Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The HSE ensures that the system responds to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals in these circumstances.</p></reply>

These changes were made on foot of Budget 2013 which identified a wide range of savings that were required across the health services.   The General Medical Service (GMS) Scheme was one of a number of areas identified in which savings were required.</p><p>  A number of measures are being taken to reduce the cost of the GMS, which costs about &euro;2 billion per year. At the end of 2012, there were about 1,986,000 qualifying people under the GMS.  Medical cards make up the majority of this number, amounting to about 93% of the total. As part of Budget 2013, the Government has made provision for an additional 200,000 persons to be covered by the GMS. Nonetheless, it is important that we prioritise the use of scarce financial resources in the current budgetary position. </p><p>Among the Budget 2013 savings measures announced was a reduction in the income limits for over-70s Medical Cards. It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of medical cardholders aged over 70 years are unaffected by that change. For the wealthiest 5 per cent that are affected, those cardholders under the old income limits will continue to be provided with a free GP service. The Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2013 was enacted on the 28th   March 2013 to give effect to the revised eligibility arrangements. </p><p>  At that time also, it was also announced that the rules on a person's expenses that are taken into account in calculating their net income for medical card purposes would be tightened. The changes introduced by the Health Service Executive mean that payments on a home improvement loan and a &euro;50 per week allowance for a car are excluded from the standard means test assessment. These changes took effect from April onwards. </p><p>  For clarity, the exclusion from travel to work costs relates to removing the weekly amount of &euro;50 allowed to cover standing charges, such as depreciation or other running costs, used when considering travel to work costs as an outgoing where public transport is not available or suitable and a car is required. This means that the HSE will continue to consider the standard mileage costs or public transport costs when assessing eligibility.</p><p>  There are a broad range of allowable expenses under the means test assessment for medical cards that have not been affected by these changes and the need to reduce the income limits for medical cards has been avoided, by these measures.  </p></reply>

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU, together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, has developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset.  This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan.  The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.</p><p>   My Department has been in regular contact with the parties involved in the project referred to by the Deputy and I have been kept informed of developments.</p><p>  Unfortunately, on the basis of the tender prices received, the cost of the project is well beyond that projected.  Louth County Council would be required to fund the shortfall and as it is beyond their capacity to do so, a decision to put the project on hold has had to be made.</p><p>  Due to budget cut backs my Department has had to curtail its own investment on major new / improvement projects in recent times to focus available funds on necessary maintenance and repair work and therefore is not in a position to make up the shortfall identified.  While my Department would be willing to consider helping to make up some of the shortfall, Louth County Council and the Department of Regional Development would also have to do so.</p><p>  There does not appear to be strong support for doing this given the need to prioritise road maintenance and restoration over new projects and the fact that there are many other new bridge and new road projects that have a much higher benefit to cost ratio than Narrow Water.  I am very disappointed that it has not been possible to find a contractor willing to build the bridge for the estimated cost.</p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland works closely with Cruise Ireland and has provided funding to them to promote the sector.  The Port of Cork has  enjoyed a steady increase in the number of cruise vessels calling at its facilities in recent years with 2012 being a record year for the port as 57 vessels called bringing 87,193 passengers and crew to the region.  This year the<i></i>port expects further growth and is on course to welcome 61 vessels and 135,386 passengers and crew.</p><p>  It is important to recognise that the cruise industry is not a lucrative source of revenue for port companies themselves and that it can be difficult for investments in this area to remunerate themselves from the charges of ports levies.  However, such visits do provide considerable benefit for the local and wider regional economy.  All cruise infrastructure developments must be funded by the ports from their own resources on a commercial basis or through collaboration with those beneficiaries of cruise tourism, be they regional interests or the cruise operators themselves.</p><p>  More generally, the development of cruise tourism is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.

The State Airports Act 2004 provided the statutory basis for the separation of Shannon airport from the DAA. That Act also contains provisions in relation to the terms and conditions of service, including pension matters, of the employees who transferred to the SAA last December and those provisions remain unchanged.</p><p>  I am satisfied with progress  to date by the now independent Shannon Airport Authority.</p><p>  It will be recalled that a major consideration for the Government in its decision on Shannon of last November was the serious decline of passenger traffic at the airport over recent years. Passenger numbers plummeted by over 60% from a peak in 2007 of 3.62 million to 1.39 million in 2012.  It was recognised that a consistent decline on this scale would be challenging to reverse and would not happen overnight. Indeed, passenger numbers continued to decline in the first five months of this year.  The immediate priority for the re-constituted board and new CEO of SAA is to halt this decline and then reverse it. </p><p>  I was very pleased to see that last month, June, recorded the first monthly growth in passengers at Shannon in over five years - an 8% increase compared to June 2012.  With a focus on developing new routes and on driving additional traffic on existing capacity, 2013 is currently forecast to see a modest overall increase of approximately 1.5% in passenger traffic at Shannon for the first time in seven years.  If this reversal in the slide over the past five years is confirmed as the year progresses, it will prove a major achievement for Shannon in its first full year as an independent airport.</p></reply>

The latest Commission proposals are designed to improve the implementation of the existing legislation from 2004 and 2009 through certain reforms in institutional arrangements and the provision of air navigation services.</p><p>  My Department has recently commenced a detailed consultation process of stakeholders in Irish aviation with an invitation to provide comments by 6 September 2013.  Comments received will be carefully considered as part of the process of finalising an overall national position to be adopted in the negotiations to take place on these proposals from Autumn onwards.  The precise implications of the proposals will of course depend on the final outcome.  I would however draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Ireland has one of the lowest en route air navigation charges in Europe, which reflects the strong emphasis that the Irish Aviation Authority places on competitiveness and productivity that will equip the IAA well in relation to the further development of the Single European Sky.</p></reply>

However, Canada issues licences at provincial level.  The Irish Embassy in Ottawa therefore engaged with the provincial authorities in Canada, and several provinces were identified where progress might be made.  It was decided to prioritise Ontario as it is now home to a large community of Irish people.</p><p>  I gather from the RSA that a considerable amount of work has now been done both by them and by the authorities in Ontario, although they have yet to conclude what is a very detailed project of study and comparison of the two licensing systems.  In the meantime, the RSA has also engaged, with the help of the Irish Embassy, in a similar process with the provinces of Alberta, Newfoundland, Manitoba and Labrador.  Although engagement has only relatively recently started with Alberta, the authorities there have allowed a concession by accepting Irish licences and granting holders an exemption against waiting time within their own graduated driving licence (GDL) system.</p></reply>

The key concerns are: that footpaths are provided for the safety of pedestrians and to segregate vulnerable road users from passing or parking traffic on the roadway; that footpaths are not constructed to the same specifications as roads and are not built to bear the weight of vehicles; and that pavement parking, if allowed in some areas, could become a matter of habit for many people and difficult to restrict to the areas where it is legally permitted.  As all of these concerns would still apply, whether or not a pilot scheme was carried out, I do not have any plans to carry out such a scheme in the foreseeable future.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.</p><p>  Earlier this year I announced that just over &euro;350 million was being allocated to local authorities under the regional and local road grants investment programme.  More recently I announced an additional &euro;50 million for works on regional and local roads under the Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure Investment Plan, bringing the total funding available for regional and local roads this year to just over &euro;400 million.</p><p>  My Department and local authorities are working closely to develop new more efficient ways of delivering the best outputs possible with the funding available to them.  Given the likely continued squeeze on Exchequer funding this concentration on efficiency is essential to achieve the best outturns for the limited money available.  In this regard, I have provided local authorities additional flexibility this year by allowing Councils to transfer resources into their discretionary grant.  In addition my Department has been working with local authorities to implement a pavement management system to link pavement distress to treatment options.  I have been encouraging local authorities, as the bodies responsible for the maintenance and repair of roads, to utilise this system to its full capabilities.</p><p>  My Department also commenced a pilot Community Involvement Scheme whereby the local community can contribute to works in money or in kind.  This scheme is available to give local communities the opportunity to have these works completed where they would not normally be considered for funding.  It is also important to re-iterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area.</p></reply>

It is also open to local authorities to include roads which are now in urgent need of repair but were not on the original programme.  While this additional allocation is to be directed primarily to surface restoration works, if the Council considers that there are particular safety schemes that need to be progressed urgently some of the additional funding may be allocated to such schemes.</p><p>  Insofar as is practical and prudent, I am happy to give local authorities discretion on their roads budget and that was what I sought to do in this instance.

In this context, however, it is necessary to bear in mind that under the provisions of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, one of the IAA's principal objects empowers the company to decide, as it sees fit, the extent to which it should operate and manage terminal navigation services at any of the three State airports, including Cork Airport. Accordingly, I have no statutory function in relation to this matter.</p><p>  I understand that the IAA has decided to postpone for a six-month period its decision on the implementation of a modified air traffic control service at Cork Airport during which time traffic levels during the night-time will be monitored. This monitoring of the operational and commercial environment at the airport is designed to ensure the provision of an air traffic control service appropriate to the level of traffic at Cork Airport, including a continuous 24 hour operation if the traffic demand requires.</p><p>  I believe that the IAA has arranged a consultation meeting in Cork in August that will also be attended by the operators of Cork Airport as well as local business representatives. This initiative will provide an excellent forum for the interested parties involved to present their concerns and interests and I am confident that a satisfactory outcome can be achieved.</p></reply>

In relation to the award of Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts for the bus market, this falls under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).  The NTA is currently considering how best publicly subvented bus services will be provided in the future. The direct award (monopoly) contracts for the provision of PSO bus market services held by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann expire late next year.  The awarding of the licenses for the services thereafter is a matter for the NTA, and not for Government, but the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has kept the Cabinet updated on the process.</p><p>  Where the NTA proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Under the legislation, if the NTA proposes to enter into direct award contracts, the relevant section states that  &ldquo;it may only do so where it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts&quot;.  If it is not so satisfied, it must provide for some level of competitive tendering.  As explained above, this is not a decision for the Government or for me.</p><p>  The NTA is conducting its work in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.
