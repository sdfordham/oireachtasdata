Of this, approximately &euro;3m is associated with new entrants in the Department of Defence.  Work has continued to improve the accuracy of this estimate and as a result of new data submitted it is likely that the estimated cost in the Department of Defence will increase slightly. It is not expected that this additional data will impact the overall estimated cost of approximately &euro;200m per annum.</p>  <p>  Discussion on this issue with Unions, which commenced in October of last year, are ongoing with the last meeting taking place on 27 April.  Further engagement is being arranged for early June. </p></reply>

In this regard, the OGP has developed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which consists of 5 strands:</p>  <p>  -  Legislation (Directives, Regulations)</p>  <p>  -  Government Policy (Circulars, etc.)</p>  <p>  -  Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works</p>  <p>  -  General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services</p>  <p>  -  More detailed technical  guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the OGP</p>  <p>  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  The framework supports contracting authorities, including the OGP, the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for works, goods and services.  It enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their Public Procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.</p>  <p>  I should point out that Local Authorities like all Contracting Authorities are responsible for adhering to the procurement policy framework and for the individual procurement decisions they make.  In terms of adopting a consistent approach to public procurement, I understand that the Local Government Management Agency provides advice and assistance to Local Authorities regarding national and EU procurement regulations and contract management issues affecting their activities and monitors legislative and case law developments to ensure its processes remain current in light of these developments and other best practice initiatives. </p>  <p>  I would add that, last July, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. </p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that while the OGP guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority, including the Local Authority Sector, to ensure they adhere to these rules.</p>  <p>  The OGP supports compliance by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.  The solutions provided by the OGP include a broad range of Framework Agreements from which public bodies can draw down goods or service, and include areas as diverse as uniforms, food, legal services, IT, and electricity.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the OGP's Key Account Managers are in regular contact with Procurement Officers in Government Departments and State Bodies, including the Local Authority Sector to assist, support and remind them of their obligations in relation to public procurement.</p>  <p>  Finally, National rules and EU Directives are clear that individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement. In this regard, the Local Government Audit Service (LGAS) audits the accounts and provides independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700049#WRA01400"><p>Managing the delivery of public services within allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department.  There are important measures in place to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met and my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  Expenditure profiles are published for each month, and the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross Voted Expenditure at end-April 2018 was &euro;19,216 million.  This is &euro;74 million, or 0.4%, below profile and an increase of &euro;1,367 million, or 7.7%, on the same period in 2017. </p>  <p>  Of the total &euro;19,216 million, gross voted current expenditure accounts for &euro;18,084 million, which is &euro;192 million, or 1.1% ahead of profile, and an increase of &euro;1,177 million, or 7.0% on the same period in 2017.  This level of year-on-year increase is partly due to timing issues relating to Child Benefit and Garda Pension payments, profiled for May, which were brought forward to April.  As outlined in the April Fiscal Monitor, this arose as the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) system was closed on the first of May. These timing issues will reverse in May. </p>  <p>  Gross voted capital expenditure accounts for &euro;1,132 million, which is &euro;266 million, or 19% below profile and an increase of &euro;190 million, or 20.1% on April 2017.  Capital expenditure in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government Vote Group is running &euro;158m or 43% behind profile.  This is largely due to a delay in drawing down payments to Irish Water. It is anticipated that these drawdowns will be completed in the coming months bringing expenditure back in line with profile. </p>  <p>  As at the end of April, 13 of 17 Vote Groups are either at or on profile. My Department will continue to engage with all other Departments and Offices throughout the year in relation to expenditure management.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700049#WRA01700"><p>The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme was the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State and covered 300 areas believed to be at significant flood risk. The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch by me in Athlone on 3 May, 2018 of 29 Flood Risk Management Plans which proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of  the Office of Public Works (OPW).</p>  <p>  I was delighted to be able to launch the Plans with the Taoiseach and to announce a major 10 year &euro;1billion programme of investment in flood relief measures.  I also said on the day of the launch that it would not be possible to implement all of the capital projects in one go and that a phased approach was necessary.  In that regard I also announced funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the 5 largest schemes identified in the Plans among them Limerick city and Tralee and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by the local authorities.   </p>  <p>  The OPW is working closely with the local authorities to commence the progression of the projects. Details on the arrangements for the advancement of the five largest schemes, each with a value of between &euro;15m and &euro;40m, and 14 schemes costing between &euro;1m and &euro;15m, will be agreed with the relevant local authorities in the near future.</p>  <p>  The allocation of almost &euro;1billion by the Government in the National Development Plan up to 2027 for flood risk management will allow the annual allocation for flood risk measures increase from almost &euro;70m in 2018 to &euro;100m per annum by 2021 and thereafter. </p>  <p>  There are ten projects directly on the River Shannon from Limerick City upstream to Leitrim Village which are to be implemented over the course of the next ten years.  One scheme from the existing Capital Programme is already underway in Athlone and will be completed over the next two years.  Another five schemes will be advanced as part of the first tranche of new projects.  Another four projects will be part of the second tranche to be implemented. The total investment in these projects will be approximately &euro;90m. </p>  <p>  Over the whole of the River Shannon River Basin District (RBD) 34 areas will have new flood relief schemes implemented over the course of this 10 year programme to 2027, which will provide flood protection to over 3,200 properties. </p>  <p>  In addition to the capital projects, the Shannon Flood Risk Management Plan also sets out a broad range of non-structural measures to manage flood risk in the Shannon catchment including maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes and Drainage Districts, ongoing Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure Associated with Hydro-Power Generation on the River Shannon, improving Long-Range Forecasting on the river Shannon to Optimise Operation of Water Level Management Infrastructure and the continued coordination of water level management by all relevant agencies on the Shannon to assist in reducing flood risk.  The latter measure, in particular, is one of the key objectives of the River Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group established by the Government in January 2016. This is a solutions focussed group that added value to the Shannon CFRAM Study by ensuring the best possible level of co-ordination between all statutory bodies involved in flood risk management of the Shannon River Basin.</p>  <p>  The Group is trialling the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen since 2016.  It is examining a plan for strategic maintenance, to help reduce further deterioration of the River Shannon, and is also examining the development of viable flood risk reduction measures in the Shannon Callows.</p></reply>

While high level evidence collected by the Commission in their first report indicated that there are no significant recruitment difficulties across the main public service vocational streams, it found evidence of some recruitment and retention issues in certain specific areas . These include certain areas of the Health sector and the Defence Forces, as well as senior executive and professional posts in the civil service. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 included a commitment to request the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a more comprehensive examination of recruitment and retention  issues in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are evident. </p>  <p>  In accordance with this provision, the Commission commenced its examination late last year  and is expected to complete its task by end 2018.  The Commission is adopting a modular approach to its work with the first module, currently being progressed, comprising an examination of the health sector grades of nurses, consultants and doctors.  This will provide the evidence base as to the nature and extent of any recruitment and retention issues and the causal factors contributing to them.  </p>  <p>  The Commission have been asked to present a range of options for resolving any specific issues identified having full regard to the fiscal constraints and requirements on Government to manage the Exchequer pay bill in a sustainable way over the medium and long-term.</p></reply>

Neither area is in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, but I can give my assurance that the OPW and the local authority will work closely to ensure that both will be commenced in the coming years and within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment. </p></reply>

This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in terms of its ability to fund infrastructure directly.  The fact that PPPs use private finance, on an off-balance sheet basis, enabled a number of key projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of Exchequer funding alone.</p>  <p>  In ensuring Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment, PPPs, just as traditionally procured projects, are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as traditionally procured projects.  All projects over &euro;20m are required under the Public Spending Cote to be subject to a Cost Benefit Analysis or Cost Effectiveness Analysis.  In addition, all public investment projects of this value must also be referred to the National Development Finance Agency for advice in terms of the options for financing and procuring the projects.   </p>  <p>  As outlined in the NDP, and as recommended by the PPP Review, PPPs will continue to feature as a procurement option available to Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  While there are a number of previously announced PPP projects in the pipeline for delivery over the coming years, no further specific additional projects have been identified in the NDP for procurement by PPP at this stage.  Rather, it is essential that projects are judged on their merits, on a case by case basis, and if procurement by PPP is found to offer better value-for-money than traditional procurement in the case of the various projects identified for delivery in the NDP, then they should be selected and progressed by the relevant sponsoring Department or agency on that basis. </p></reply>

The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was requested to prioritise the drafting of the necessary legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for a Bill to be drafted and pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas, given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations, and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However,  the drafting process is underway and the Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the current session.  Indeed, I understand that the drafting of the legislation is significantly advanced with an expected publication date, subject to Government approval, of next month.</p>  <p>  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision of 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Government Decision.  The interim arrangements (which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65) will, through retire and re-hire, enable pre 2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 to remain in employment until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66.

Performance budgeting is a key element of this suite of expenditure reform measures that also includes the augmentation of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), tasked with carrying out evaluations and value for money reviews, and the Spending Review process that provides an evidence base to inform the prioritisation of expenditure.</p>  <p>  A key aim of the performance budgeting initiative is to maximise the reporting of relevant quantitative metrics capable of being used to assess trends over time in order to underpin the scrutiny and appraisal of expenditure programmes.  Since its introduction in 2011, performance budgeting has been subject to ongoing refinement with a clear focus on, and significant improvement in, the quality and volume of quantitative information published in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV). REV 2018, as part of a pilot programme of Equality Budgeting, also includes indicators relating to equality objectives for a number of Departments.  The performance budgeting initiative also supports another important aim: transparency and accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to facilitate budget oversight by the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  Performance Budgeting operates within the wider expenditure framework that is focused on seeking to ensure that growth in public expenditure is sustainable.  However, increasing and competing public service demands means that managing expenditure within these parameters is challenging.  In this context, the focus must be on examining the totality of public expenditure including in particular the rationale/objectives, effectiveness, efficiency and impact of public spending.  The Performance Budgeting initiative, with its focus on quantitative metrics that can be tracked over time complements the revised Spending Review process that was introduced last year. The over-arching purpose of the Spending Review is to broaden the Government's toolkit within the budgetary process.   A systematic review of the effectiveness and impact of expenditure within the existing cost base can produce options for reprioritisation of expenditure in order to fund new policies from within existing ceilings. </p>  <p>  As such performance budgeting cannot be viewed in isolation from the other expenditure reform measures such as the continued expansion of the IGEES and the Spending Review process, that all work towards embedding an ongoing evaluation culture across Government.</p></reply>

This report, and the substantial amount of work that has taken place since on this costing, will provide the evidence base for the negotiations that are ongoing.</p>  <p>  Discussion on this issue with Unions, which commenced in October of last year, are ongoing with the last meeting taking place on 27 April.  Further engagement is being arranged for early June. </p>  <p>  In relation to recruitment  and retention issues in the public service, the evidence shows that the public service is a good employer by any objective measurement.  Public Service offers a comprehensive set of terms and conditions, flexible working arrangements, decent pension provisions, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment.  While public service is a career choice, and people who serve are highly motivated by the public good, the competitiveness of the package on offer can be seen in the strong level of recruitment that this report has highlighted. </p>  <p>  Headline public service numbers already show a high level of recruitment of plus 29,000 since 2013. However this is the growth in the overall public service, as such it doesn't capture recruitment "below the line" replacing retirements and leavers. </p>  <p>  The report I submitted on Friday 16 March 2018 however sheds light on this, revealing that over 60,500 people have been recruited in the "new entrant" grades since 2011.  This represents almost a fifth of the current public service including over 16,000 teachers, nearly 5,000 Special Needs Assistants and almost 10,000 nurses.  At an individual level people are looking at the remuneration package, including terms and conditions, and the opportunities that a career in the public service presents and are opting to join in great numbers.  This substantiates a finding of the Public Service Pay Commission that there was no general recruitment problem, and that at lower pay levels there is a substantial pay premium in favour of public servants. </p>  <p>  Where there may be specific recruitment problems in certain specialist areas the Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked to examine these issues in detail, starting with the Health sector, and I expect an initial report from the PSPC later this year.</p></reply>

The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.</p>  <p>  The elements that make gender and equality budgeting work such as impact analysis and evaluation are important in any good budgetary process. Gender and equality budgeting should not to be seen as something separate from the budget process, the intention is to embed a gender and equality perspective throughout the budgetary process, with a whole of year budgetary focus.</p>  <p>  A pilot programme of equality budgeting for the 2018 budgetary cycle is underway, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework.  International experience has shown the importance of setting specific and measurable targets.  This approach works well in terms of transparency around objectives and measuring progress.  For this first cycle of equality budgeting, a number of diverse policy areas have been selected with associated objectives and indicators published in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 in December last.  Progress towards achieving these targets has been reported on in the Public Service Performance Report 2017 published last month.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high level goals articulated is a matter for the individual spending Departments in the first instance.  The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate the initiative and provide support for Departments to fulfil the Programme for Government commitment.</p>  <p>  The pilot programme of equality budgeting is to be reviewed, with learnings from the pilot approach used to expand the initiative to other expenditure programmes and equality dimensions for the 2019 budgetary cycle.  To further guide the roll-out of equality budgeting it is intended to establish an Equality Budgeting Steering Group.  This group will be comprised of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance the initiative.</p></reply>

The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch by me in Athlone on 3 May, 2018 of 29 Flood Risk Management Plans which proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of  the Office of Public works (OPW). </p>  <p>  I was delighted to be able to launch the Plans with the Taoiseach and to announce a major 10 year &euro;1 billion programme of investment in flood relief measures.  I also said on the day of the launch that it would not be possible to implement all of the capital projects in one go and that a phased approach was necessary.  In that regard I also announced funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the 5 largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by the local authorities. </p>  <p>  Flood relief projects have been identified in the Plans for both Newbridge and Athy.  Neither area is in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, but I can give my assurance that the OPW and the local authority will work closely to ensure that both will be commenced in the coming years and within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment. </p>  <p>  In relation to Castledermot and Suncroft,  potentially viable structural flood relief measures have been investigated and technically viable flood relief schemes have been identified.  However, a more detailed assessment of the costs and benefits will have to be completed to determine if the proposed Schemes are feasible.  This further assessment will commence later this year.</p>  <p>  The allocation of almost &euro;1 billion by the Government in the National Development Plan up to 2027 for flood risk management will allow the annual allocation for flood risk measures increase from almost &euro;70m in 2018 to &euro;100m per annum by 2021 and thereafter. </p></reply>

In 2017, PeoplePoint, now called HR Shared Services, completed in excess of 231,000 HR and pensions transactions and received over 86,000 calls and 4 million website visits. PeoplePoint applies Government HR and pension policies and procedures on behalf of its clients and all decision making remains with each Department or office.  It started to provide services to a small number of Government Departments and offices in 2013, increasing this in phases over time, until it completed its establishment at the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  The benefits of HR shared services have included the first ever online system for applying for annual leave and other forms of leave; a website providing all Civil Servants with easier and faster access to important information on entitlements and services; one set of standard HR processes, applied consistently, based on HR policy. These standard processes are eliminating local interpretation and thereby increasing fairness for everyone. The value of shared services is to standardise and optimise processes to improve service quality and to apply policy administration equally across the Civil Service whilst improving data accuracy and reporting.</p>  <p>  A programme of continuous improvement is in place in PeoplePoint, seeking to increase efficiency and effectiveness, and includes; greater automation of business processes to reduce or eliminate errors or delay; a workflow management review and ongoing staff training and quality review programmes.  A customer services group with representation from HR Managers from a number of Government Departments was also established in 2017 to support the effective delivery and future development of shared services and to ensure that the voice of the customer is fully considered.  I am informed that the management team fully accepts that the service level is not yet where it needs to be to satisfy all users. As part of its continuous improvement initiatives, a major customer survey will be conducted this year to obtain full and objective information on satisfaction levels which will help to inform further targeted actions in order to achieve the highest service levels. </p></reply>

As regards the European Social Fund (ESF), administrative responsibility rests with the Minister for Education and Skills.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine has administrative  responsibility for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), and the Minister for Social Protection has administrative  responsibility for the European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD).</p><p>In relation to ERDF, Ireland has been allocated &euro;409m support for the programming period 2014-2020.  It should be noted that this amount is matched with 50% Exchequer funding, therefore the total allocation for ERDF programmes is &euro;818m.  ERDF contributes to combatting social exclusion by creating employment through investing in business start-ups, and enhancing SME competitiveness. </p><p>FEAD aims to help people take their first steps out of poverty and social exclusion by addressing their most basic needs i.e. food and or basic materials for personal use.  The FEAD budget for 2018 is &euro;8m. &euro;4.5m of this will be allocated to ongoing food distribution through the central procurement in FoodCloud Hubs.  The remaining &euro;3.5m is allocated to the distribution of material assistance in the areas of homelessness, school kits and new migrants. </p><p>Under Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF OP, a community led local development initiative is being implemented through seven Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) covering all coastal areas of Ireland.  The FLAGs are provided with a &euro;12 million budget, co-financed by 50% exchequer funding, in the period 2014 - 2020, to disperse within their respective FLAG territories through grant aid to projects that contribute to the achievement of the FLAG&rsquo;s Local Development Strategy.  The FLAGs focus on promoting innovative approaches to create growth and jobs in their territories, and enhance the socio-economic prospects of their area, in particular by adding value to fishery and aquaculture products and diversifying the local economy of their territories towards new economic activities.</p><p>While the FLAG scheme is the most directly relevant to social inclusion, other EMFF schemes also contribute to this objective.  For example, the EMFF Inshore Fisheries Scheme supported the establishment and ongoing development of representative forums for the inshore fisheries sector (i.e. the National Inshore Fisheries Forum and 7 Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums) to give voice and representation to small scale coastal fishermen from many remote areas of Ireland.</p><p>As regards the ESF, while it is required that at least 20% of the ESF resources in each Member State be allocated to the social inclusion objective, the Irish ESF Programme has gone beyond this and has in fact allocated 34%, or &euro;388m, of the total Programme allocation of &euro;1.157bn, to this objective.  This is co-financed by 50% exchequer funding in the period 2014 - 2020. </p><p>Social inclusion activities supported include:  </p><p>-  the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme,  which tackles poverty and social exclusion;  </p><p>-  Youthreach which provides education, training and work experience for early school leavers;</p><p>-  Garda Youth Diversion Projects, which support young people at risk of/or involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour; </p><p>-  Young Persons Probation Projects, which engage with young offenders in local communities; </p><p>-  the T&uacute;s Nua Project, to promote independent living and positive reintegration into the community for women leaving prison and women offenders referred from the community;</p><p>-  the Ability Programme to promote employment prospects and meaningful social roles for young people with disabilities;</p><p>-  projects to support the integration and employment of migrants; and</p><p>-  gender equality projects aimed at women who are currently detached from the workforce and business women who wish to realise their full business potential.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.78.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700050#WRB05500"><p>Table 3 on Page 22 of the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2017 set out an amount of &euro;3.2 billion in respect of the estimated net fiscal space for 2019.  In arriving at this net amount, the fiscal space impact of certain pre-committed voted expenditure was deducted from the gross fiscal space.  The nominal amounts relating to these pre-commitments were set out in Table 1.3 on Page 9 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report (MYER) 2017, with &euro;0.4 billion of current expenditure in respect of demographics and &euro;0.3 billion of capital expenditure arising from increases set out in the Public Capital Plan and from prior year budget adjustments.</p>  <p>  The SES and the MYER did not reflect the impact of the abolition of domestic water charges and the consequent change in funding arrangements for Irish Water.  Irish Water expenditure was therefore included within the overall General Government expenditure amounts in the SES, and reflected increases in relation to Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment programme.  With funding in respect of domestic water services now being provided through voted expenditure, &euro;0.1 billion of the overall year-on-year increase in voted capital expenditure in 2019 arises from the change in funding arrangements for Irish Water and is therefore technical in nature.  This technical change was reflected in the multi-annual capital ceilings included in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 published in December last year. </p>  <p>  Consequently, of the &euro;2.6 billion in voted expenditure pre-commitments set out in the Stability Programme Update 2018, the fiscal space impact of nominal amounts of &euro;0.4 billion in voted current expenditure and &euro;0.4 billion in voted capital expenditure, including the &euro;0.1 billion in relation to Irish Water capital expenditure, were taken into account in arriving at the estimated net fiscal space amount of &euro;3.2 billion for 2019 in last year&rsquo;s SES.  </p>  <p>  Table 4 on Page 23 of the SES outlines the indicative allocation of available net fiscal space for 2018-2021.  This Table outlines an indicative allocation of &euro;1.5 billion in fiscal space for expenditure in 2019, with over &euro;0.9 billion of this amount for current expenditure and just under &euro;0.6 billion for capital expenditure.  This was the pre-Budget position and expenditure allocations made as part of the Budget Estimates process in October last year, set out in Expenditure Report 2018, utilise most of this indicative allocation.   </p>  <p>  In relation to current expenditure there are pre-commitments that arose after the SES of &euro;0.7 billion that would need to be funded from the current expenditure fiscal space amount or from savings/reprioritisation.  There is a cost of &euro;0.4 billion arising in 2019 from the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA).  This amount was not included as pre-committed expenditure in the SES or the MYER as the agreement at that stage was subject to ratification by the membership of the Public Service Unions and Staff Associations.  In addition, as outlined in the Expenditure Report 2018, there was a cost estimated, at that time, of &euro;0.2 billion in respect of the carryover impact of certain Budget 2018 measures that would need to be met from the available resources for 2019 or from savings/reprioritisation.  The current estimate of the carryover impact into 2019 is &euro;0.3 billion.  This estimated carryover impact will be reviewed in the context of this year&rsquo;s MYER to take account of expenditure developments during the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 last October, additional capital was allocated over the four year period 2018 to 2021 following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan. Expenditure Report 2018 set out gross voted capital expenditure amounts of &euro;5.3 billion for 2018 and &euro;6.6 billion for 2019.  These amounts were in line with the increases set out in the MYER, with just over &euro;0.3 billion in the pre-Budget position and just under &euro;1 billion to be allocated as part of the Budget 2018 process.  The fiscal space impact of the additional capital allocated during the Budget 2018 process is in line with the indicative allocations of fiscal space for capital grants and gross fixed capital formation of just under &euro;0.6 billion in aggregate. Consequently, these increases fully utilise the indicative fiscal space for capital grants and gross fixed capital formation set out in the SES for 2019. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan revised the Departmental capital expenditure ceilings for 2019 to 2021, published in REV 2018, to facilitate the early commencement of a number of funds.  The voted capital expenditure amount in the Stability Programme Update for 2019 reflects the additional funding allocated in the National Development Plan in respect of the Rural, Urban, and Innovation Funds.  With the cost of the funds being partly covered by an unallocated capital reserve, the additional cost arising in 2019 is less than &euro;0.1 billion. </p>  <p>  Consequently, the expenditure pre-commitments outlined in the Stability Programme Update that arose after publication of last year&rsquo;s SES and MYER amount to &euro;1.8 billion, with an impact on fiscal space of c. &euro;1.4 billion after taking into account the estimated effect of the capital smoothing adjustment that applies under the Expenditure Benchmark.</p>  <p>  The Stability Programme Update (April) 2018 provides for an increase in Voted Expenditure of &euro;2.8 billion in 2019, including the pre-committed expenditure of &euro;2.6 billion.  After providing for this increase of &euro;2.8 billion in Voted Expenditure, a deficit of 0.1 per cent of GDP is projected for next year.</p>  <p>  The Summer Economic Statement will outline the fiscal parameters for Budget 2019.  In setting out these parameters a key consideration is the formulation of budgetary policy, based on what is right for the economy, and that does not jeopardise the sustainability of our public finances and our future living standards.</p></reply>

This was a special acknowledgement from the Government to the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who served during the centenary year of 2016.  The 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal was awarded as a commemorative medal, personal to an individual&rsquo;s service in the Defence Forces in the course of 2016.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to former members of the Defence Forces.  Since the foundation of the State many thousands of personnel have served in the Defence Forces.  It would not be administratively possible within the resources of the Department to identify and contact all of these persons, decide on eligibility and, in the case of infirm or deceased former members, resolve who should get the medal on their behalf.</p>  <p>  At my request, however, discussions took place between the Department and the Veterans&rsquo; Associations - the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (ONE), and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO) - to explore alternative means of recognition of the contribution of veterans to the centenary commemorative events in 2016.</p>  <p>  Following these discussions, it was agreed that a single presentation would be made to each of the Veterans Associations of a framed medal with an accompanying citation in recognition of the significant contribution of members of the three organisations to the 1916 centenary commemorative events and their service to the State.  The medal has a bar with the term Veteran inscribed on it.  I agreed that a plaque would be given to each of IUNVA&rsquo;s 21 Posts and to each of O.N.E.&rsquo;s 41 Branches.  I presented one plaque to each of the three Veterans&rsquo; Associations at last year's Defence Forces&rsquo; Veterans&rsquo; Day which took place in the Defence Forces Training Centre, the Curragh, on Sunday 8th October 2017.  The other plaques were presented separately.</p></reply>

This was that the announcement was premature and ill-advised, and would be unhelpful to efforts to reach a resolution of the Middle East Peace Process, something which is very urgently needed.  I conveyed to the US Government ahead of its announcement my concern about reports of US intentions, and I know that very many leaders around the world did the same.  The announcement, when it was made, was thus very disappointing and difficult to understand.</p>  <p>  My view that this move is mistaken and divisive remains unchanged, following the formal transfer of the US Embassy to Jerusalem this week.  This involved essentially the move of the Ambassador&rsquo;s official location to the existing US Consulate building in Jerusalem.  The actual transfer of the bulk of Embassy functions will await the construction of a new Embassy premises, which may be a lengthy process.</p>  <p>  Thus far only three Central and South American countries have announced that they will follow the US move.</p>  <p>  Ireland looks forward in due course to establishing Embassies in Jerusalem to both Israel and the future Palestinian state, following the conclusion of a peace agreement and in accordance with international law.  Until then, our Embassy to Israel will remain in Tel Aviv.</p>  <p>  Efforts to restart the peace process are currently centred on the initiative being developed by the United States.  I have spoken at the Foreign Affairs Council to urge EU partners to engage with the US to encourage this initiative and to seek to shape it and ensure that it is in line with the key parameters for a settlement.  I have myself met with the US team a number of times in this regard.</p>  <p>  The US move on Jerusalem has unfortunately made this initiative more difficult, by damaging the trust of Palestinians in their approach.  I hope that this can be overcome.</p></reply>

They will come back into force over a period of three to six months.  The US Government has also stated an intention to impose additional sanctions.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to estimate the impact these actions will have, at this early stage.</p>  <p>  The JCPOA was a multilateral agreement which remains in operation despite the US decision, and which retains the full support of Ireland and the EU.  All the other parties to the agreement have said that they intend to continue to implement it.  The UN and EU sanctions on Iran, which were directly in force in this country and which were removed under the JCPOA, will therefore not be reimposed.</p>  <p>  The US sanctions which had caused the most difficulty for Irish firms seeking to do business in Iran were those in the financial sector, and for the most part these were not suspended under the JCPOA and had remained in operation.  This had led to a continued reluctance of many European banks, including Irish banks, to handle funds originating in Iran.  This had undoubtedly slowed the regrowth of trade with Iran following the JCPOA. This will continue to be a factor.</p>  <p>  The effect of any new US sanctions cannot be estimated until they are known, but there is certainly concern at EU level over possible extra-territorial impact of US sanctions on EU firms doing business with Iran.  This has already been discussed with Iran by EU Ministers this week, and will be an issue which will be followed closely at EU level in the period ahead.</p></reply>

This built on the progress made on legacy issues during the talks in 2015 that led to the Fresh Start Agreement.</p>  <p>  In our recent discussions, the Secretary of State and I have agreed on the importance and urgency of achieving a definitive move forward with the establishment of the Stormont House legacy framework.</p>  <p>  Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long already for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland for dealing with legacy issues from the Troubles.  In this regard, I welcomed the launch on 11 May of a public consultation by the British Government on their draft legislation to establish the legacy bodies provided for in the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced and I continue to raise this issue with the Secretary of State.  I have urged all with responsibilities in relation to legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Legislation will also be required in this jurisdiction to provide for cooperation with the Stormont House legacy bodies.  The preparation of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and the Oireachtas is being advanced by the Department of Justice and Equality in consultation with my Department.</p>  <p>  The Government remains determined to see that there is progress in the period ahead on the Stormont House Agreement institutions, on legacy inquests in Northern Ireland and on other outstanding legacy issues, including the three all-Party Motions adopted by this House on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties to seek an urgent move forward on these legacy issues to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors, and contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

This is made up of growth in average pay of 2.6 per cent, with the remainder due to growth in the number of employees.  Pay bill growth is projected to average 5.1 per cent per annum thereafter, with average pay expected to grow at around 3.0 per cent per annum.</p>  <p>  To the extent that wage pressures exceed these projections, this could be expected to boost consumption and overall price levels in the near term.  However, to the extent that such higher pay rates result in a loss of competitiveness, any positive impact will be offset by lower overall economic activity and lower numbers employed.</p>  <p>  Work published previously by my Department titled 'Quantification of the economic impacts of selected structural reform in Ireland' (www.finance.gov.ie/updates/quantification-of-the-economic-impacts-of-selected-structural-reforms-in-ireland/) indicates that a 1 percentage point wage shock which is not offset by a corresponding rise in productivity could be expected to reduce the level of real output (GDP) by &frac14; percentage point (pp) within 7 years, add 1pp to the rate of unemployment, and reduce the number of people employed by some 0.4 percentage points.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the public service is concerned, the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 negotiated last year between Government as employer and public service unions and associations provides the framework for affordable adjustments in pay and industrial relations stability.  The Agreement provides for the phased unwinding of FEMPI measures on a sustainable basis over the 3-year period 2018-2020 with benefits for public servants ranging from 6 to 7.4 per cent over the period - an average of 2 to 2.5 per cent per annum.</p>  <p>  Given downside risks within the international context, it is imperative that wage developments should be commensurate with trends in productivity (output per person employed) over the coming years, in order to avoid a deterioration in Ireland's competitiveness.  We will therefore continue to monitor the wage outlook, and labour market and productivity developments.</p></reply>

All relevant Government Departments will examine the full package carefully and to understand the overall implications for Ireland.  Ireland will also engage constructively with European partners on these proposals. </p>  <p>  By its nature, the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) is a complex and detailed proposal and Member States need to fully analyse and consider its potential impact on national tax systems.

The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on or review any particular case, but I will focus my reply on the Deputy's question on the steps taken within my remit to address the issue of insurance costs.  As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases.  </p><p>In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will use a combination of rating factors, which include the age and type of the vehicle, as well as the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, the profession of the driver and how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to particular categories, different insurance companies will have different views.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, the Cost of Insurance Working Group has published two reports, into the Cost of Motor Insurance (2017) and Employer Liability and Public Liability Insurance (2018) to address the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses alike.  The Motor Report made 33 recommendations across six key themes: protecting the consumer; improving data availability; improving the personal injuries claims environment; reducing the costs in the claims process; reducing insurance fraud and uninsured driving, and promoting road safety and reducing collisions.  The Employer and Public Liability Report builds on those recommendations and its 15 recommendations focus on increasing transparency, reviewing the level of damages in personal injury actions and improving the personal injuries litigation framework.  Both of these reports are available on my Departments website: </p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations made in each of these Reports and the Working Group has committed to publishing quarterly updates on its progress.  The fifth such update was published on 11 May and shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met, while substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  </p><p>It is envisaged that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and improved availability of insurance products.  In relation to the cost of motor insurance, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for April 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained with the result that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

However, Revenue does not have any role to play under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act and is not involved in inspecting relevant establishments to ensure compliance with that legislation.</p>  <p>  As regards taxation, the profits of any dog breeding business are liable to tax irrespective of whether it is included on a register of dog breeding establishments or not. Revenue has confirmed that it examined a number of such establishments as part of its 2017 compliance programme, most of which were found to be tax compliant with enquiries still ongoing in a small number of cases. </p>  <p>  Taxpayer confidentiality provisions contained in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 precludes Revenue from providing any information in regard to the specific case mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.</p></reply>

In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to particular categories, different insurance companies will have different views.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years with a related problem as referred to in the PQ being the availability of cover in the first place.  These issues were the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The fifth such update was published on 11 May and shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.

However, I am hopeful that the improved stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016. In addition with the full implementation of the Motor Report, I believe that Ireland will be more attractive to new entrants thus increasing capacity as well as competition which should have a positive impact in niche areas such as musicians.   </p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, under the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA), which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he or she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website while Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  The relevant contact details are: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.  </p></reply>

Firstly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person&rsquo;s principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement is relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home.  In addition, the beneficiary must not have a beneficial interest in another residential property.  Finally, the beneficiary must have lived in the house for 3 years prior to the date of the inheritance and must continue to live in the dwelling house for 6 years after the date of the inheritance. </p>  <p>  Amendments to the dwelling house exemption in Finance Act 2016 sought to realign the exemption with its original policy objective i.e. to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability for a person who inherited a house in which he or she had been living with the deceased and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.  Along with the requirement that the dwelling house be the principal private residence of the disponer, the changes also meant that the relief would only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it is no longer possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception is where a person gifts a dwelling house to a &lsquo;dependent relative&rsquo;.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. </p>  <p>  If a beneficiary qualifies as a &lsquo;dependent relative&rsquo; then there is no requirement that the dwelling house be the principal private residence of the disponer or that the beneficiary remain in the dwelling house for 6 years after the date of the inheritance.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the disponer, or of the disponer&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The dwelling house exemption applies to siblings living together as it does to any other persons living together who satisfy the qualifying conditions for the exemption.  The changes made in Finance Act 2016 as described above affect all such persons. </p></reply>

Such an appeal takes the form of an application to the General Court of the European Union (GCEU), asking it to annul the Commission&rsquo;s Final Decision. </p>  <p>  The Attorney General prepared the legal grounds in support of the annulment proceedings and the application was lodged in the GCEU in 2016.  As is normal practice, a summary of these have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union. They were also published on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website in December 2016. </p>  <p>  The case has been granted priority status and is progressing through the various stages of private written proceedings before the GCEU.  It is at the discretion of the court to determine if there will be oral proceedings, either in public or in private.  It will likely be several years before the matter is ultimately settled by the European Courts.  </p>  <p>  As this is the subject of open legal proceedings, it will not be possible to comment further, in particular on any of the individual elements of the State&rsquo;s legal case in defence of our position. This is important to ensure that we do not prejudice our own legal case. </p>  <p>  All Member States have legal standing to intervene in proceedings that go before the European Courts and do so from time-to-time if it is considered that a case raises particular points of relevance for their country. They therefore may intervene in the Irish appeal, and it is a matter for each Member State to make that decision. </p>  <p>  Apple have also initiated their own distinct annulment proceedings in the court.  As this is Apple&rsquo;s own legal case, it is not appropriate to comment on any proposed interventions in their case as this is a matter for the respective parties. However, I can confirm that Ireland has intervened in that case to ensure that the best possible case for Ireland is presented to the court on all matters relating to the Apple State Aid Decision.</p></reply>

Companies that carry on a trade previously carried out by another person do not qualify.  Nor do many consulting companies, which carry on a profession rather than a trade, qualify.</p><p>-  Gives up full-time employment elsewhere to take up full-time employment with the new company.</p><p>- Invests in ordinary share capital of the new company.</p><p>The relief available is based on the amount invested and the amount of tax paid, through the PAYE system, for the previous 6 years. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to give an average time taken to issue a decision regarding approval or rejection. In the more straightforward cases, the application will normally be processed within a month while in the more complex cases, it can take up to 6 months before processing of the application is completed.</p><p>The time taken to process a SURE application depends on a number of factors including the complexity of the corporate structure of the company concerned and the extent and completeness of the supporting documentation presented with the application when it is initially made to Revenue. </p><p>Of the 29 applications received since 1 January 2018, 13 have been the subject of additional information requests by Revenue.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I announced that a review of both the EII and SURE incentives was to be carried out this year.

Its objective is that employers, employees and Revenue will all have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information available relating to pay, tax, PRSI and USC deductions.  This will ensure that the right amount is collected at the right time from employees, and that employers pay their correct liabilities when required.  The new reporting requirements also minimise the scope for error and omission by employers.</p>  <p>  Real-time data will assist Revenue in ensuring that employees get the full benefit of their entitlements during the year, in particular where an individual has a number of employments.  Providing employees with access to the statutory deductions reported by their employer and an end of year income statement will improve the accuracy, ease of understanding and transparency of the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  For Revenue, the availability of real-time information will inform its risk profiling, identification fraud and non-compliance activities, including assisting in the earlier identification of insolvent businesses.  PAYE Modernisation will also provide the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection with more timely data regarding employments and PRSI contributions and provide greater assurance on the overall PAYE yield, which will enable better forecasting and policy decisions.</p>  <p>  Revenue is undertaking a co-design approach to PAYE Modernisation.  It has engaged with key stakeholders since the start of the project and continues to do so to ensure the design is optimised through their input. This will result in a more streamlined process and ultimately a reduction in the administrative burden for employers with pay and tax reporting being a by-product of their payroll process. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that significant change management structures have been put in place for PAYE Modernisation.  These include the following key components:</p>  <p>  -  Monthly meetings with external stakeholders that includes organisations like the Small Firms Association, ISME, IBEC, Irish Tax Institute, Chartered Accountants Ireland, Chambers Ireland, Financial Services Support Unit (under Department of Education) and accountancy firms.</p>  <p>  -  Monthly meetings with key staff representatives.</p>  <p>  -  Fortnightly or monthly meetings, as required, with the Payroll Software Developers&rsquo; Association.</p>  <p>  -  Revenue has presented on PAYE Modernisation at over 170 events arranged by representative bodies, payroll software providers, tax practitioners and the Irish Payroll Association (IPASS) throughout the country. </p>  <p>  At the end of April 2018 Revenue issued a letter to 219,000 registered employers informing them of the upcoming changes and providing them with links to detailed content on the Revenue website . This letter also provided a link to sign up for regional seminars that will be run by Revenue in September 2018. To date over 3,300 employers and agents have registered their interest in attending these seminars.</p>  <p>  Revenue is also undertaking customer service visits to employers to help them prepare for PAYE Modernisation.  These visits will focus particularly on small employers who do not have payroll software or a tax agent to help them prepare for the new reporting requirements.  Revenue will undertake a media and advertising campaign later in the year to maximise the level of awareness of the changed reporting obligations under PAYE Modernisation.</p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that preparations for PAYE Modernisation are well advanced.  There is currently c. 100 staff in Revenue dedicated to PAYE Modernisation working on regulations, ICT development, change management and business readiness.  Revenue recently recruited 40 Clerical Officers specifically to scale and develop the employer helpdesk in advance of the new employer reporting requirements.  It is anticipated that Revenue will also require c.35 temporary Clerical Officers in 2018/2019 to manage a peak in business arising from the transition to the new reporting requirements and the simultaneous reporting by employers of the 2018 end of year return.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that total project spend to date is &euro;9.2m. At this point, total project cost for the years 2017-2019 is estimated to be between &euro;25-&euro;30 million.  It is important to point out that this expenditure is in the context of a system that brings in almost &euro;1 billion every month to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

This success has been underpinned by changes in the legislative landscape that have made Ireland an attractive domicile for promoters in Asia, across Europe, the U.S., and further afield.  We also have a regulatory regime providing a robust and consistent approach to the supervision that promotes confidence in Ireland as a location for investment funds.</p>  <p>  Due to changes in the global private equity market in both structure and relevant European legislation, there is a need to update the Investment Limited Partnership Act 1994.  This objective has been included in the IFS2020 Action Plan which commits to developing amendments to the Investment Limited Partnership Act 1994 to make the structure more attractive to fund managers. </p>  <p>  Consequentially, my Department sought and obtained approval from the Government for the preparation of Heads of Bill in 2017.  The Heads of Bill have been sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and a drafter has been assigned to work on this.</p>  <p>  The Bill appears on the legislative programme for 2018 and it is anticipated that the draft legislation will be developed in the second half of the year with the intention for the Bill to be considered by the House before the end of this year. </p></reply>

I believe that it is very important that this market is competitive, vibrant and that there are no barriers to entry facing potential new entrants.  If we want to increase its capacity and facilitate further competition, this must remain a key policy goal.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation of the sector.  This framework is mainly governed by the EU Solvency II Directive, which provides for three ways in which an insurance undertaking can operate within the Irish market.  These are to:</p>  <p>  -  establish a head office in Ireland (authorised by Central Bank of Ireland); </p>  <p>  -  establish a branch in Ireland through Freedom of Establishment (FOE); or </p>  <p>  -  operate on a Freedom of Services basis (FOS).</p>  <p>  My understanding is that there are companies operating in each of these channels in the Irish insurance market.  The Solvency II framework is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of access to markets within the EU, but also with regard to the level of supervision and regulation.  In the context of my functions around the legal framework governing financial regulation, I am satisfied that insurers can compete on a level playing field.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Insurance Ireland operated Insurance Link database I am aware that there are some membership criteria for new entrants.  Having said that, this is something that I have no control over.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, it is important to note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the Group's Report on the Cost of Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance have made a number of recommendations that are relevant to the issue of supporting a level playing field.  In this regard the insurance fraud database recommendation requires that it be available to all insurers participating in the Irish market for fraud detection purposes. It is hoped that this recommendation, along with other recommendations made in the field of transparency and the reduction of claims related costs in particular, should encourage competition and potential new entrants.</p></reply>

The macroeconomic outlook set out in April, as part of the SPU, will underpin the SES.  The SES will broadly set out what the Government believes to be the appropriate fiscal policy next year, taking into account Ireland's stage in the economic cycle. </p>  <p>  Whilst the economy is forecast to continue to grow strongly over the coming years, the SES will reflect the need to avoid any policy measures which could contribute to overheating in the economy.  As a small open economy we are exposed to a number of external risks, particularly in relation to Brexit, changes in the international tax landscape and rising geopolitical tensions, all of which have the potential to destabilise our economy.  The Government is cognisant of these risks and recognises the need to plan for the future and manage our resources in a prudent fashion.  Given the uncertainty we face over the coming years we need to continue to focus on enhancing our competitiveness and building up resilience in our public finances.</p>  <p>  I aim to publish the Summer Economic Statement in the Summer.</p></reply>

My Department ensures that every effort is made to limit the use of consultancy where possible.  It should be noted that the complex nature of the Department&rsquo;s work in recent years in leading major reform programmes, such as the roll-out of shared services by the National Shared Services Office or the transformation of the central procurement function under the Office of Government Procurement, means that it is necessary for the Department to bring in external expertise from time to time.  All contracts are negotiated with a view to achieving best value for money and are kept under review to ensure this is maintained.  When the use of consultants is unavoidable, the staff in my Department ensure appropriate skills transfer to reduce the requirement for consultants going forward.</p><p>My Department actively ensures that funds appropriated to it by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are spent in a manner that supports the achievement of the best possible value-for-money.  Consequently, each Division in my Department examines and reviews capital, consultancy and information technology project expenditure on a regular basis.  This process is formalised through the collation of bi-annual value for money reports on such projects.<table><tr><th>Consultant</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Accenture</td><td>Build to Share (OGCIO)</td><td>&euro;34,440</td></tr><tr><td>Accenture</td><td>Build to Share (OGCIO)</td><td>&euro;10,762</td></tr><tr><td>Accenture</td><td>Build to Share (OGCIO)</td><td>&euro;51,660</td></tr><tr><td>Accenture UK Ltd</td><td>Robotic process automation process analysis, HSE and passport office</td><td>&euro;13,214</td></tr><tr><td>Achilles Procurement Service</td><td>Strategic Advice (OGP)</td><td>&euro;32,643</td></tr><tr><td>Agency Assessments Ireland</td><td>EMA bid - Consultancy services (OGP)</td><td>&euro;861</td></tr><tr><td>Analysys Mason</td><td>Mobile voice and data sourcing   strategy report (OGP)</td><td>&euro;26,912</td></tr><tr><td>Aspira</td><td>Expert analysis and advice on implementation of eCohesion System</td><td>&euro;79,824</td></tr><tr><td>Astron</td><td>Review of system design and operation of eCohesion IT system</td><td>&euro;22,140</td></tr><tr><td>Bearing Point</td><td>Service supply contract research into technical, operational, market and procurement considerations into implementation of a future Human Capital Management system for the Civil Service</td><td>&euro;71,401</td></tr><tr><td>Bearing Point</td><td>ICT common services evaluation (OGP)</td><td>&euro;18,450</td></tr><tr><td>Bearing Point</td><td>ICT common services evaluation (OGP)</td><td>&euro;24,600</td></tr><tr><td>Bearing Point</td><td>Expert advisory services to the   Single Scheme Administration   Project (Design phase)</td><td>&euro;95,854</td></tr><tr><td>Bid Management Services</td><td>Professional Services (Bid Manager) (OGP)</td><td>&euro;61,474</td></tr><tr><td>Byrne Wallace</td><td>Consult on employment law</td><td>&euro;119,433</td></tr><tr><td>Coyne Research Associates</td><td>Research consultancy (OGP)</td><td>&euro;11,162</td></tr><tr><td>Deloitte</td><td>Financial management shared   service project / GDPR assessment services (NSSO)</td><td>&euro;1,553,960</td></tr><tr><td>Empirica</td><td>Strategic Advice (OGP)</td><td>&euro;59,427</td></tr><tr><td>Ernst &amp;amp;

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.182.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700054#WRF01400"><p>The National Planning Framework is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Compliance with 2020 renewable energy targets is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. However, as my Department has been involved in both processes I will address the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p>  <p>  In the first instance it should be noted that there are no "impending fines".</p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  While good progress has been made to date, meeting the target remains challenging.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's most recent assessment is that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of the 16% renewable energy target by 2020 - or, to put it another way, we will be between 82% and 96% of the way towards the target.</p>  <p>  Failing to achieve our 2020 target under this Directive could give rise to the usual penalty applied by the Commission when a Member State breaches a Directive &ndash; infringement proceedings.  It is only when an infringement proceeding reaches the stage of 2nd referral to the European Court of Justice that the Commission might ask the Court to impose fines.</p>  <p>  However the Renewable Energy Directive also provides a framework for Member States to work together towards renewable energy targets.  This includes mechanisms which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits - or what are termed statistical transfers -from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.</p>  <p>  How much this will cost depends on two factors &ndash; price and quantity.  How much will we miss our target by and what price will other Member States be prepared to sell to us at.  Because of the uncertainty inherent in each of these factors it cannot be definitively said how much this purchase of compliance will cost.</p>  <p>  Work undertaken by the SEAI in 2016 indicated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.  However, present indications, based on a trade agreed by other Member States late last year, suggest that the cost per percentage point for statistical transfers is likely to be below the lower end of the range suggested by SEAI.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and cost of addressing our target within the framework of the Directive is underway between officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and my Department </p>  <p>  With regard to the National Planning Framework, one of the key objectives of that document is to make our planning system more responsive to our national environmental challenges.  It commits the Government to integrating climate action into the planning system in support of national targets for climate policy mitigation.  This plan will be complemented by the forthcoming Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework which will aim to identify strategic areas for the sustainable development of renewable electricity projects and by new Wind Energy Guidelines which will facilitate informed decision making in relation to onshore renewable energy infrastructure.</p></reply>

These programmes are 85% funded by the EU through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the European Union's Cohesion Policy.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government remains firmly committed to the successful implementation of the current programmes and to successor programmes post-2020.</p>  <p>  Work on this objective commenced as soon as the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership was known.  Shortly after the referendum I met the then Finance Minister in Northern Ireland, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, and we agreed to write to the EU&rsquo;s Regional Policy Commissioner, Corina Crețu, to highlight the importance we attach to the programmes.  I subsequently raised the programmes at the Cohesion General Affairs Council and met Commissioner Crețu to discuss them.  Throughout this period my officials have also been engaging with their European Commission counterparts.</p>  <p>  I was pleased, therefore, that the Irish Government's ambitions for the programmes were reflected in December's EU-UK Joint Report on Brexit in which both parties undertake to honour their commitments to the two programmes under the current MFF and to examine the possibilities for future support favourably.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased that the Commission has now brought forward proposals for future programmes in its proposals for the EU budget post-2020.  My officials and I will continue to work with the Commission and our EU partners to ensure the continuation of these important programmes post-2020.  The future of these EU-funded programmes are part of the ongoing work of the Barnier Task Force, and negotiations with the UK will take place in that context.</p></reply>

This includes a requirement for applicants to have proven proficiency in two languages, one of which must be Irish or English.</p>  <p>   In cases where candidates do not have the required proven proficiency Irish or English e.g. have not achieved a minimum of Grade D in Ordinary Level at the Leaving Certificate, and have qualified at Stage 3 (interview) of the selection process, the Public Appointment Service affords those candidates an opportunity to undergo an alternative written and oral language test.  The written and oral language test process is an alternative route for the candidate to demonstrate proficiency in the language if they do not have it in the Leaving Certificate. </p>  <p>  However, the written and oral language test is analogous to the Leaving Cert in that candidates have only one opportunity to demonstrate proficiency.  The recruitment process to Garda Trainee is a competitive one.  It is not appropriate in the context of a competitive recruitment process to afford a candidate additional opportunities to complete elements of the assessment process.  It is however open to individuals to apply again for subsequent Garda Trainee competitions, if they continue to be eligible.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p><p>Procurement reform is a key element of the Government's overall reform programme and is aimed at delivering increased value for money, and having a strategic approach to public procurement across the public sector.  </p><p>A key element of the reform programme has been to ensure it is being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises as the engine room of our economy.  The aim is to drive fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace but also to work with business to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p><p>The Government has committed in the Programme for a Partnership Government to refining the new procurement structures in place and to make adjustments according to best international practice and in conjunction with Irish business.</p><p>My colleague, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan chairs the SME Advisory Group in accordance with the Programme for Government.  He hears at first hand the concerns of industry at these quarterly meetings.

This is the OGP's third annual report that analyses expenditure and tendering activity on goods, services and minor works across public service bodies in Ireland.  I would point out that the analysis is encouraging, indicating that 94% of the State&rsquo;s expenditure is with firms within the State.</p><p>Finally, it is also important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad.  Public expenditure on goods, works, and services representing approximately 14% of EU GDP with an annual value in the order of &euro;2 trillion.  The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

Significant reforms have been made in recent years and have made the work of the public service more transparent, decision-making more accountable and service delivery more effective and efficient.  There has been much progress since the first reform programme was started in 2011, in areas including procurement, shared services and civil service renewal, and public service reform continues to play a key role in Ireland&rsquo;s development.</p><p><b><i></i></b><i>Our Public Service 2020</i>, which I launched last December, is a new policy framework designed to build on these previous reforms while expanding the scope of reform to focus more on collaboration, innovation and evaluation.  I am confident that <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>will contribute to the strengthening and further development of our economy over the period of its implementation.</p><p>A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has also been established to drive the reform agenda and lead on its implementation.  This approach will support and enable public servants and their organisations to perform at their best and to work together to deliver high-quality, value-for-money outcomes that will benefit the economy.</p><p>As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is prudent and sustainable.  There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews.  The actions in <i>Our Public Service 2020 </i>will ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services, while operating within these prudent limits.</p><p><b><i></i></b><i>Our Public Service 2020</i>contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture.  The newly established Reform Evaluation Unit will work closely with other units within my Department focusing on performance budgeting and spending reviews to strengthen the links between expenditure and reform.  This will take place alongside the work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) which leads a programme of evaluation of public service delivery across the public service.  A series of rolling, selective reviews, which will cover the totality of Government spending over a three-year period to 2019, started in 2017.</p></reply>

My own Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles, in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-April 2018 was &euro;19,216 million.  This is &euro;74 million, or 0.4% below profile.  Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;18,084 million, is &euro;192 million, or 1.1% ahead of profile.  Timing issues relating to Child Benefit and Garda Pension payments, profiled for payment at the start of May but brought forward to April, account for the significant portion of this variance.  As outlined in the April Fiscal Monitor, this arose as the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) system was closed on the first of May due to the European Public Holiday.  These timing issues will reverse in May.  Health expenditure of &euro;5,152 million was 1.4% above profile.</p>  <p>  Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;1,132 million, is &euro;266 million, or 19% below profile and up &euro;190 million, or 20.1% on April 2017.  Capital expenditure in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is running &euro;158 million or 43% behind profile, largely due to a delay in drawing down payments to Irish Water.  It is anticipated that these drawdowns will be completed in the coming months bringing expenditure back in line with profile.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, sound public finances are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth in the context of our economic recovery.  This requires effective and efficient management of  overall expenditure.  To support this goal, my Department has been engaging with a range of Departments on year two of the Spending Review process, with a view to reinforcing a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Public Service Performance Report was published last month and this aims to strengthen focus on what is being delivered with public funds.  Performance targets are published in the Revised Estimates Volume each year.  This report, provides timely quantitative performance data to help to enhance the focus on performance and delivery by presenting relevant performance indicators in a dedicated, focused document.</p></reply>

Under the Renewal Plan the established policy of open competition for senior management positions (Assistant Principal and higher) has been extended following a hearing at the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  </p>  <p>  I understand from the Public Appointments Service, who are the independent recruiter for the civil service, that since then in the region of 8,175 civil servants, excluding temporary assignments, have been assigned to Government departments and offices across all general service grades from open competitions.  These increases would be offset by people leaving the Civil Service including retirements.  </p>  <p>  Further consideration will be given to recruitment in the civil service for the remainder of 2018 and 2019.  </p>  <p>  Recruitment plans for the public service more generally are a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister with responsibility for each of the relevant sectors of the public service.  </p></reply>

Additional resources were quickly provided to Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Bord Bia to provide critical support to companies and to help them deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 is continuing the work of getting Ireland Brexit ready.  Based on the assessment of what is now required to continue preparing the economy for the challenges it faces, the Budget contained measures to improve the competitiveness of our personal taxation system; introduce a new &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for SMEs; further the establishment of the Rainy Day Fund to strengthen our finances in a changing world; allocate additional capital expenditure of &euro;4.3 billion over the next four years; increase education spending for 2018 to over &euro;10 billion so as to keep our economy competitive and attract investment post-Brexit; increase resources for the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine to over &euro;1.5 billion and so support Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry; and increase the allocation for the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation to provide for additional staff in the Department and the enterprise agencies.  </p>  <p>  Brexit will also be a critical factor in our longer-term economic strategy.  Good long-term planning supported by investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure has a very important role to play in ensuring the resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  The National Development Plan demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure and investment needs over a ten year period.  It will assist in future-proofing the economy and safeguarding economic growth from the risks and uncertainties of Brexit.  It will improve our competitiveness and resilience and enhance our ability to continue to attract and maintain business.  </p>  <p>  The NDP comprises an investment programme of &euro;116 billion.  Investments which will be particularly relevant to Brexit include integration of transport, energy and communications networks; new resources for tourism development and promotion; and supporting Brexit-exposed firms to diversify international markets.  </p></reply>

This approach considers the entire school community, as well as focussing on groups and individual young people with identified need.  This approach spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support, pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. The whole staff shares responsibility for general student wellbeing.  </p><p>At post-primary level the Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013)<b></b>provide a framework for schools to present in an integrated way the existing elements of good practice to promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct then to appropriate practice.  They provide clear information for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of social emotional learning and mental health promotion.  The European wide HSE supported, Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice.  The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) Continuum of Support tiered approach.  </p><p>The processes outlined span the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.  </p><p>The key message of the Guidelines are that Schools play a vital role in providing a protective environment for young people which can promote wellbeing, pupil resilience and counteract risk factors through a whole-school approach.  </p><p>Where difficulties do arise in relation to pupil mental health it promote the development of structures to promote awareness and recognition of such difficulties and provide the appropriate support  including input by the Guidance Counsellor and where necessary and appropriate to support student access, in conjunction with parents to referral pathways within HSE and other mental health services in their local community (e.g., HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services or Clinical / Community Care Psychology).  </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 affords particular priority to the support of wellbeing and mental health structures and supports in all schools.  These include:</p><p>-  Publishing a Wellbeing Policy Statement in 2018 and commencing, as resources permit, a national programme to support all schools to implement the national Wellbeing in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and Wellbeing in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015)</p><p>-  Implementing the new Junior Certificate area of learning entitled Wellbeing </p><p>-  Extending Pupil Resilience and Teacher Classroom Management Programmes to all DEIS schools</p><p>-  Increasing the capacity of NEPS by 65 educational psychologists to deliver an enhanced educational psychological service to schools </p><p>-  Enhancing Guidance Counselling at second level</p><p>-  Undertaking an assessment of the supports to schools in areas of mental health and wellbeing with a view to providing an enhanced and better integrated service</p><p>-  Working closely with the Department of Health and others departments on the National Task Force on Youth Mental Health.  </p><p>The Counselling and Guidance Counselling professions are two separate professions with their own unique roles and set of professional competences.  Guidance in schools refers to a range of learning experiences provided in a developmental sequence that assist students to develop self-management skills which will lead to effective choices and decisions about their lives.  It encompasses the three separate, but interlinked, areas of personal and social development, educational guidance and career guidance.  </p><p>Counselling is a key part of the school guidance programme, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process and at moments of personal crisis.  Counselling has as its objective the empowerment of students so that they can make decisions, solve problems, address behavioural issues, develop coping strategies and resolve difficulties they may be experiencing.  Counselling in schools may include personal counselling, educational counselling, career counselling or combinations of these.  </p><p>Personal counselling in this regard should be recognised as a direct support to students experiencing mental health difficulties which may in certain circumstances operate as a pre-cursor to or in tandem with clinical or formal therapeutic counselling services provided by outside HSE agencies.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware this Government has restored some 500 guidance posts to post-primary schools previously withdrawn in 2012.  </p><p>As stated previously the school Guidance Counsellor is an integral part of the wellbeing support structure within post primary schools and therefore the restoration of the 500 posts provide additional support to the student body generally in terms of school guidance plans but also in relation to direct individual counselling support to students in crisis.  </p></reply>

The framework seeks to prioritise the alignment of targeted and planned population and employment growth with educational investment.  The National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027 also emphasises investment in higher education in the regions to underpin economic and employment growth.</p><p>The higher education sector will see a very significant ramping up of investment in<b></b>infrastructure in existing higher education institutions, from approximately &euro;800 million over the past decade to &euro;2.2 billion over the coming decade.  This will cater for the growth in enrolments due to demographic changes, improve the quality of provision and build competitiveness at the national and regional level, through ensuring a pool of relevant skills.  In October 2016, it was announced that new buildings across 11 Institutes of Technology would be included in a PPP Programme for the higher education sector.  It is projected that the buildings will deliver a total of 8,000 new student places and will significantly enhance the capacity of those institutions to meet regional and national skills needs.  The Government is also investing significantly in the Dublin Institute of Technology Grangegorman campus with the sod being turned on a &euro;220m building project on 30 April 2018.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Technological Universities Act was signed into law on 19 March 2018.  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver social and economic benefits to their regions through a strengthened role in research and innovation and the delivery of a broad range of high quality education and training in each of their campuses.</p><p>Other than the potential establishment of technological universities under the 2018 Act, there are no proposals at this time for any new higher education institution to be established to cater specifically for demographic growth.</p></reply>

The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding (Cassells Report) which was published in July 2016, clearly outlines the funding challenges in the higher education sector and offers a number of potential policy approaches for consideration. </p>  <p>  While Cassells deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education we also have to consider the immediate challenges.  In advance of receiving the recommendations of the joint committee, the government has moved to increase funding into the sector. We have therefore prioritised this area in Budgets 2017 and 2018.   </p>  <p>  As a result, my Department is investing &euro;100m more in higher education in 2018 compared to 2016.  Separate to this is the provision which I have made for pay restoration costs in 2018.  We will seek to build on this progress in Budget 2019.  This additional funding will allow for targeted initiatives in higher education including skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the sector.  It will also allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2018, the Government decided to raise the National Training Fund levy by 0.1% in 2018 to 0.8% and by a further 0.1% in both 2019 and 2020.  The increase in funding from the National Training Fund is a key strategic element of the overall funding increase for higher and further education.  </p>  <p>  In addition, In January I published an independent review of the current allocation model for funding higher education which provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed funding model that is more transparent, consistent across higher education institutions, incentivises actions in key strategic areas such as research and STEM provision, and supports improved accountability while also respecting institutional autonomy.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive approach is being taken in order to contribute to the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the sector.  As such, it will be important to build broad political and societal consensus on achieving the most appropriate future funding model and my Department and I continue to work to that end. </p></reply>

The proposal was agreed subject to all 5 primary school including Scoil Oilibheir Naofa agreeing a Common Application and Enrolment Policy and having a commitment to grow naturally.  The Patron also agreed to ensure that all schools will not act outside the remit of the Common Application and Enrolment Policy and on this basis, schools will not be allowed to develop at the expense of other schools.</p>  <p>  My Department has, for the first time, introduced an objective, statistics based model for deciding which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest concentrated levels of disadvantage.  My Department will be in touch with the schools concerned shortly regarding DEIS status. </p>  <p>  The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  The criteria for the appointment of an administrative deputy principal to a school, which are enrolment related, are set out in Appendix B of Circular, 0010/2018.  There is no scope to deviate from these arrangements.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The general approach taken in cases of amalgamation is that the existing staff of the pre-amalgamation schools can remain in the newly amalgamated school.  Where this results in the newly amalgamated school having more staff than that warranted by the staffing schedule, a concessionary allocation is given to the school to allow all of the teachers remain in place.  The concessionary post is only retained until such time as one of the existing cohort of teachers leaves the newly amalgamated school and, as such, is not a permanent allocation but is a temporary measure to assist in the amalgamation process.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools.  This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  Enabling teaching principals to have one release day per week would cost approximately &euro;12 million per annum.</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.

To be eligible for assistance there must be at least 500 redundancies in a specific company (including suppliers / downstream producers) in a 4 month period, or at least 500 redundancies in a specific sector in a 9 month period.  In small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances, applications can be made where the minimum threshold number of redundancies is not entirely met and the Member State can substantiate that there is a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy. </p>  <p>  The package of measures that can be co-financed by the EGF include personalised active labour market measures targeted at the redundant workers.  Before an application for EGF assistance can be submitted to the EU Commission, the redundancies in question must have been announced by the enterprise(s) concerned.  </p>  <p>  While the EGF could potentially assist workers made redundant following Brexit, there is no scope under the existing regulatory framework for the EGF to be used to support companies at risk.  There are a range of measures being put in place to support companies impacted by Brexit, such as the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Brexit SME Scorecard and the Be Prepared Grant.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation are examining the potential for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme while the EU Commission has approved a rescue and restructuring scheme which can be drawn on in exceptional circumstances for companies severely affected by Brexit.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  In addition, as the Deputy will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise.  For this reason, the number of Garda available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Cohort model of resource allocation is currently utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College.  The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues.  When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p>  <p>  In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p></reply>

Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,632.  There are also 562 Garda Reserves and more than 2,280 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division. </p><p>Due to the moratorium on recruitment there were no attestations in the period 2012-2014.  For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the Garda Divisions to which new recruits have been allocated from 2015 to date in 2018 as advised by the Commissioner:</p><p><b>Probationer Garda Allocations by Division - 2015 to 2018</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Donegal Division was 394.  There are also 14 Garda Reserves and 35 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.  </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  32 members of this cohort have been assigned to the Donegal Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Donegal Division.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>The number of newly attested Garda&iacute; allocated to the Donegal Division in 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018 is as set out in the following table:</p><p><b>New recruits assigned to Donegal 2015 -2018</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>STATION </th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>LETTERKENNY</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>13</td><td>4</td><td>32</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Specifically, this involves considering the feasibility of establishing a specialised and dedicated insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, funded by industry.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) has engaged with Insurance Ireland, submitting a mechanism for further cooperation and a costed proposal to Insurance Ireland in the latter half of 2017.  Insurance Ireland has agreed to explore the proposal further, subject to a full cost benefit analysis, to be carried out by Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officers Working Group.  The intention is that such a dedicated Garda unit would be funded by Insurance Ireland members and non-members alike, i.e. all entities writing non-life insurance business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  As I informed the Deputy recently, further progress on this recommendation is dependent upon the outcome of this cost benefit analysis, which is currently awaited.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that it expects to be in a position to provide an update in this regard by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  Any proposed agreed mechanism will, of course, ultimately be subject to the approval of the Garda Commissioner and myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality. </p></reply>

In commissioning this audit the Courts Service offered to engage with the group and take on board any data it wished to have included in this audit. This offer was declined at that time. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service decided, however, in the interests of transparency and good governance to proceed with the independent audit and the Committee was informed accordingly.  Following a competitive procurement process in December 2017, Mazars, a leading international audit firm and with no previous involvement in the management or audit of court funds was appointed to conduct the audit.  It commenced its independent review of 63 cases in January 2018. In conducting this audit, Mazars was given unrestricted access to all financial records in relation to these cases and the audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland).</p>  <p>  Mazars has completed their review and their report has been made available to the group, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, the Public Accounts Committee and to my Department. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that the review shows that there were no significant losses incurred by these cases during the financial crisis and that virtually all of these cases had net realised gains when units were sold.  The very significant investment returns from investment performance extended the available funds to meet ongoing care and maintenance for these cases by a considerably longer period of time than would have been the case if these cases had not been invested in the Growth Fund. </p>  <p>  Investment of court funds is carried out in line with the strategies devised and reviewed on a regular basis by the Investment Committee, chaired by the President of the High Court.  The Investment Committee reviews the investment strategies with the assistance of its investment advisors to ensure the protection and suitable investment of funds of wards, minors and others lodged in court for the benefit of those persons.  Investment policies and orders made thereunder must be in accordance with the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that a conservative investment policy is being operated.  When deciding where and how to invest court funds, the overriding objective is the achievement of an optimal total financial return having regard to the need for liquidity and capital security, taking account of income generation and capital growth requirements.  Where there is a requirement to generate a higher return to sustain the value of the funds for the longest period possible, such funds are invested in longer term growth and income generating strategies. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that a prudent approach to investing court funds is adopted and takes only measured and appropriate risks, based on independent investment advice, in the best interests of all beneficiaries.  The Courts Service has informed me that the independent review carried out by Mazars, and the review carried out by Aon Hewitt in 2016 as well as the annual independent external audits over many years, found no evidence of negligence or mismanagement of funds.</p></reply>

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in 14 provincial court offices.  </p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that the Probate Office is funded and resourced from the overall budget allocation made to the Superior Courts Directorate which has responsibility for the administration of this Office.  There is no specific budget allocation for the Probate Office and therefore it is not possible to provide the budgetary data requested by the Deputy.</p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that District Probate Registries operate as an integral part of each relevant Combined Court Office.  All Combined Court Offices provide services within the overall budget allocation provided to the Circuit and District Court Directorate which has overall responsibility for the management and administration of that budget across all offices within the Directorate, including the District probate function.  There is no specific budget allocation for the administration of probate services in District Probate Registries and therefore it is not possible to provide the budgetary data requested by the Deputy. </p><p>The Courts Service has informed me that the number of staff currently assigned to the Probate Office is 21.5, which includes an increase of 5.5 staff to this Office in the last 12 months to address delays in the processing of probate applications. </p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that the staffing of the District Probate Registries forms part of the overall staff structure within the Combined Court Office.  Staff are allocated to Combined Court Offices on the basis of the entire spectrum of services provided, including the delivery of probate services.  The allocation of staff resources within an office at any given time is a matter for the local office manager based on business priorities and demands, particularly in relation to the support of the judiciary in the administration of justice.  It is therefore not possible to provide the Deputy with data in relation to the actual number of staff assigned to probate duties in any given year. </p><p>However, as the Deputy may be aware, the Courts Service has recently completed a review of the delivery of probate services and a plan is now being developed to implement the recommendations on a phased basis.  The Report has been forwarded to my Department and published on the Courts Service Website.</p><p>As part of the information gathering exercise undertaken as part of the review, the Courts Service undertook an assessment of the number of Full Time Equivalent staff assigned to Probate duties in each of the District Probate Registries.

The Report recommends that the Quebec Task Force (QTF) Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) grading scale should be used going forward by all medical professionals reporting on relevant injuries.  These are internationally recognised scales based on severity of symptoms and associated physical signs.  A standardised medical reporting template is included in the Report.</p>  <p>  The Report recommends that training and accreditation of medical professionals who complete personal injury medical reports should be promoted.</p>  <p>  The Report also recommends the linking of future publications of the Book of Quantum to the newly standardised examination and reporting injury categories.   </p>  <p>  Finally, the Report recommends that relevant injury data should be collated and published by appropriate bodies.  The Commission also suggests that there may be merit that data available from insurers relating to the incidence of &lsquo;whiplash&rsquo; soft-tissue injuries, forms part of the National Claims Information Database which is being developed by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The next Report of the Personal Injuries Commission will predominately deal with benchmarking of Irish awards with international awards.  Independent consultants have been engaged to carry out the data validation/verification of the data received and work with the Personal Injuries Commission on the benchmarking exercise.  This Report is expected in June/July 2018 subject to the completion of the validation/verification exercise and will include any recommendations arising from the deliberations of the Commission.  The Report will be the Final Report as the second and third reports will be merged.  </p>  <p>  When the Final Report is submitted to me, I intend to bring it to Government for approval and publication soon after.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.387.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700061#WRN01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145, 151 and 152 together.</p>  <p>  The State Aid Modernisation Working Group meeting took place in Dublin on 27 April 2018 and was attended by State Aid experts from the 28 Member States.  The Agenda comprised: </p>  <p>  - Welcome speech by Dr Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General, DBEI </p>  <p>  - Presentation of the organisation of Ireland on State aid &ndash; State Aid Unit, DBEI </p>  <p>  - Preparation of the next High-Level Forum: presentation by the Chair (France) </p>  <p>  - Outcome of the monitoring exercise: presentation by the Commission </p>  <p>  - Start-ups and scale-ups: introductory point with a presentation from Belgium </p>  <p>  - Economic / non-economic activity and ancillary activity: presentation by the Commission, Denmark and the Netherlands  </p>  <p>  The mandate of the Group is to discuss best practice, share information and knowledge etc and this feeds into the High-Level Forum on State Aid which meets 1 &ndash; 2 times a year.  It is not a policy forum and therefore it is not the forum to discuss changes to State Aid thresholds in the context of Brexit.   </p>  <p>   In terms of discussions in relation to State aid, in November 2017, the then T&aacute;naiste met with Commissioner Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition who has responsibility for EU State aid policy to discuss, amongst other things, the impact of Brexit on Irish businesses.  An outcome from this meeting was the establishment of a Technical Working Group comprising representatives from DG Competition, the Department of Business, Enterprise&amp;amp; Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  The Working Group has met monthly since November and in between these meetings, there has been engagement on specific issues in order to continue to progress matters.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Technical Working Group discussions and not at the State Aid Modernisation meeting.  </p>  <p>  My Department is carrying out extensive work to prepare for all Brexit eventualities. Informed by detailed research, my Department has been putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including the Brexit Loan Scheme which was launched in March 2018 and which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. </p>  <p>  By using a counter guarantee from the EIB group (through its InnovFin Guarantee) means that the &euro;24 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of &euro;300 million.  The Brexit Loan Scheme is open to businesses of fewer than 500 employees which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy demonstrating that they plan to innovate or adapt in response to Brexit.  This scheme operates within De Minimis State Aid Regulation.</p>  <p>On 4 May 2018 the EU Commission approved an extension to the Rescue and Restructuring Scheme for Ireland to include temporary restructuring aid.  This provides a further 10 million euro of State support to those companies experiencing acute liquidity needs and is in addition to the original 10m euro announced in November 2017 under the Rescue and Restructuring scheme.  Together with the Brexit Loan Scheme, this temporary restructuring aid will provide valuable stabilisation to businesses as they respond to the immediate and long-term impacts of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  My officials are also examining policy proposals for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme to support businesses to invest strategically for a post-Brexit environment and a new Business Finance Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development.   </p>  <p>  The Agencies of my Department are at the forefront in working with firms to ensure they are equipped to deal with Brexit and to enhance their performances in an increasingly competitive global trading environment through lean programmes, skills development and reducing business costs.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has launched the 'Brexit SME Scorecard', an interactive online tool which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  EI is also offering a 'Be Prepared Grant' of up to &euro;5,000 to support clients to develop a Brexit Action Plan and it continues to support clients to improve their competitiveness, acquire new markets and enhance management skills. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are organising workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit and have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive and to source new markets.  </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland is also working to minimise the impact of Brexit on north-south trade. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.390.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700061#WRN01500"><p>Ireland shares the views expressed by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Fredrica Mogherini, that the EU deeply regrets the announcement by the US that it will withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) which was signed by the "E3+3" Group with Iran.  The EU remains committed to the continued full and effective implementation of the JCPOA.  The lifting of sanctions against Iran under the JCPOA has led to a positive impact on trade and economic relations with Iran, and its commitment to ensuring that this can continue to be delivered in the interests of improved geo-political stability.</p>  <p>  Form a trade perspective, Iran, with a population of 80 million, and a relatively wealthy middle class, is a potential market worthy of further exploration for Irish exporters.  However, I share concerns that the recent announcements by the US Administration are likely to have a negative effect on this growth potential.  I am particularly concerned at reports that the US may consider imposing sanctions on European companies that do business in Iran following their withdrawal from the Agreement.</p>  <p>  According to CSO figures, Irish goods exports to Iran nearly doubled from &euro;72 million in 2016 to &euro;143 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase of &euro;67m in the General Industrial Machinery Category.  Overall however, exports to Iran are a very small proportion of Ireland's total global goods exports - amounting to only 0.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s total goods exports in 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s principal exports to Iran have usually been in the Medical and Pharmaceutical Products Category (exports of &euro;26 million in 2017, which is 0.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s global exports in this category); and Soft Drink Concentrate (exports of &euro;22 million in 2017, which is 0.3% of Ireland&rsquo;s global exports in this category).</p>  <p>  Goods imports from Iran to Ireland increased from &euro;1.6 million in 2016 to &euro;3.5 million in 2017.  These are nearly all in the sectors of fuel and vegetables/fruit.  According to the CSO, there is no services trade with Iran.  </p>  <p>  Further, according to CSO data, there is no record of Iranian foreign direct investment into Ireland.</p>  <p>  Despite the alleviation of sanctions under the JCPOA, there remain practical difficulties for Irish businesses seeking to do business in Iran.  The continuance of some US financial sanctions, has meant that European banks - including Irish institutions - have been cautious with regard to engaging in financial transactions with Iran.  In addition, Iran is often not included as a covered geographical territory for travel insurance and/or other types of business insurance, where the insurance company is from the US, or has a US mother company, and travelling to Iran negates the visa waiver for Irish passport holders travelling to the US.  </p>  <p>  Despite these difficulties, Enterprise Ireland (EI) continues to support the efforts of Irish companies wishing to trade with Iran, while highlighting the practical difficulties of doing business there.  The primary sectors where Irish companies could potentially increase their presence since the easing of sanctions are: aviation; financial services and software; ICT telecommunications and mobile software; education services; agritech/food production; and lifesciences and pharma.  EI has previously brought trade delegations to Iran, and also held a 'Doing Business with Iran' Event in Dublin in July 2017, which 35 EI clients attended.  EI has also secured the services of an in-country Iranian market expert/pathfinder, to provide advice and assist EI clients to may encounter difficulties due to the re-imposition of sanctions or the threat of same.</p>  <p>  As regards client companies of EI, the precise consequences arising from the very recent announcement by the US Administration of its withdrawal from the JCPOA are still being analysed and EI together with my Department will keep the impacts on those companies under review.</p></reply>

The Strategic Consultancy Grant supports the hiring of an outside consultant to assist the company in devising and/or implementing strategic initiatives aimed at improving business function and resilience. It is designed to facilitate business growth as the consultants can act as coach, mentor, facilitator, analyst, negotiator and/or operator for the company.  Up to 50% of the costs incurred in hiring a consultant are available up to a maximum grant amount of &euro;35,000. </p>  <p>  The Market Discovery Fund provides support to companies to assist them in researching the viability of exporting an existing product/service into a new geographic market, or introducing a new product/service into an existing market.

It has been developed to support product, service and process innovation to enhance the competitive advantage of Irish companies.  The application process is simple and quick, with a short timeframe between application and approval. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work with companies to help them to become more innovative. It has rolled out a number of Brexit Advisory Clinics across the country which helps companies to examine their exposure to Brexit and develop effective strategies to mitigate against that exposure.  These Clinics are open to both EI clients and non-clients and are delivered free of charge.  The next Clinic will take place in Dublin on June 21st at the Aviva Stadium.  Topics to be covered include Financial and Currency Management, Strategic Sourcing and Customs, Transport and Logistics, Intellectual Property, Movement of People and Markets. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has also introduced the Brexit: Act On initiative.

If this restructuring proves successful, and the US authorities expressly agree, it could result in the sanctions against the companies in question being lifted, meaning that Aughinish itself may then no longer be impacted.  However, there is no guarantee that this will happen and that is why the Government will continue to engage very closely with Aughinish and provide it with all the support it can.</p></reply>

The long-term response to Brexit is for companies to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more markets.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK, and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively supporting their clients to achieve this.  My Department provided for additional monies in 2017 to enable EI and the LEOs to ramp up supports in light of Brexit to drive improvements in:</p>  <p>  - productivity, </p>  <p>  - innovation, </p>  <p>  - management capability  and  leadership skills.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has launched several initiatives in response to Brexit, including:</p>  <p>  - Brexit Scorecard:  This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit</p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SMEs a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.  The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction  of their action plan.</p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held four Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan and Cork.  The next Clinic will be held in Dublin on 21 June in the Aviva Stadium.  The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure.</p>  <p>   - Brexit 'Act On' Programme: A consultant  spends time with EI client companies to discuss specific challenges and draw up a report with tailored recommendations that will help them address weaknesses and become more resilient.</p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on global and sectoral opportunities, further developing in-market expertise and networks, placing greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.  In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>  The LEOs are supporting their clients by providing information, training and mentoring on Brexit related issues as well as advice on other sources of support.  The suite of LEO Brexit supports available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide include.</p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce.  A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months.  ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues.</p>  <p>  Other initiatives that my Department are advancing include the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms.  I recently launched the launch of the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call.</p>  <p>  The work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future, therefore I feel that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in the event of a hard Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.414.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700062#WRO01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 to 158, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  I very much regret that Apple will not be proceeding with its plans to construct a data centre in Athenry, especially as the project would have been a source of significant investment and job creation for Galway and the West of Ireland.</p>  <p>  As with all of its clients, the IDA works with Apple to support job creation and investment in Ireland.  Given the size of the investment involved, and the subsequent issues encountered by the company throughout the planning process, IDA Ireland was in regular contact with its management throughout this time.  The Agency, however, had no role in the independent planning process and court challenges in respect of it.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the Government, together with IDA Ireland, did everything it could to support this investment.  This included high-level engagement with the company, both at home and abroad.  The Taoiseach, for example, met with the firm&rsquo;s senior management in the USA in November 2017, where he made it clear that the project had the support of our Government and the local community in Athenry.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, in spite of these efforts, Apple has taken a commercial decision not to proceed, making it clear that the delays that beset this project caused them to reconsider their plans.  As I have made clear, these delays have underlined our need to make the State&rsquo;s planning and legal processes more efficient.  The Government has therefore already been working, over the last number of months, to make improvements to those processes.  This will ensure that we are better placed to take advantage of future investment opportunities, whether from data centre providers or other sectors.</p>  <p>  The Government has, for example, published legislative proposals to designate data centres as "strategic infrastructure" for planning purposes.  This will ensure that future data centre-related planning applications can move more swiftly through the planning process.  I am hopeful that these legislative changes can be enacted by the end of the current D&aacute;il session.</p>  <p>  The Government also agreed, in October 2017, to the implementation of a strengthened policy framework to support the continued development of data centres.  This framework includes a number of actions which, once fully implemented, will help Ireland attract and sustain such investments in the future.</p>  <p>  Part of this work is the development of a National Policy Statement on the role of data centres in Ireland&rsquo;s overall enterprise strategy.  This will set out their potential to Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, especially in regional locations, whilst taking account of wider challenges in energy and renewable energy policy.  The importance of data centres to Ireland is recognised as well in Project Ireland 2040, which makes clear that the promotion of Ireland as a sustainable international destination for information and communications technology infrastructure is a key national objective.</p>  <p>  The IDA, meanwhile, is already working hard to win new data centre investments for Ireland.  Last year the Agency appointed Jacobs Engineering, supported by AOS Planning, to identify potential strategic land banks in Ireland that would be particularly suitable for the development of data centres.  Evaluation of sites that are compatible with the complex requirements of data centre investments is well advanced.  As this study is for internal IDA Ireland purposes it is not intended for publication.</p>  <p>  It is the case as well, despite the disappointing decision made by Apple, that Ireland is still a highly attractive destination for data centre projects.  There are nearly 30 major data centres located in Ireland that are operated by some of the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies and I am confident that this number will increase in the future.  Ireland&rsquo;s strengths for this type of investment, including our climate, energy supply and business environment, remain well-known to other potential investors.</p></reply>

Section 47 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts prohibits smoking in most enclosed work places.  This includes office blocks, public houses/bars, restaurants and company vehicles (cars and vans). The overall purpose of the ban is to limit people from the harms of second hand tobacco smoke.  Section 47(7) provides exemptions from the general prohibition in respect of certain places / premises including prisons, nursing homes, non-acute long stay facilities and psychiatric hospitals.  </p><p>The Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Act 2014 prohibits the smoking of tobacco in cars where children are present.</p><p>The policy document Tobacco Free Ireland (2013) sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.  Tobacco Free Ireland addresses a range of tobacco control issues and initiatives and contains over 60 recommendations. Some of those recommendations relate to extending the smoking ban on a legislative basis to the campuses of primary and secondary schools and child care facilities.  Other recommendations relate to the promotion, on a voluntary basis and in conjunction with key stakeholders, of smoke free environments on the outdoor campuses of third level institutions, health care facilities, Government facilities, sports facilities, playgrounds, parks and beaches.

Almost 50% of this funding was used to deliver home support packages and transitional care beds to reduce the incidence of delayed discharges.  Furthermore, over 200 beds have been opened this winter and more beds are due to come on stream later in the year. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the increased level of resources provided, this winter has been particularly difficult for our health services with ED attendances up 3.7% and admissions up 3.3% during the first quarter of the year, as compared to the same period in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The situation was further exacerbated by Storm Emma and the severe weather that followed.  In response to this, I approved a further &euro;5m in emergency funding to provide additional home support packages and transitional care beds to assist the safe discharge of patients who required support to return home following the adverse weather.  </p>  <p>  In the light of the conclusions of the Health Service Capacity Review that the system will need nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds by 2031, I have asked my Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed this year and into 2019 in order to improve preparedness for Winter 2018/2019. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Capacity Review, the demographic pressures being experienced by the health service are such as to demand not just additional capacity, but continued emphasis on health and wellbeing initiatives, an improved model of care with a stronger role for enhanced community based services and continued improvement in productivity including in acute hospitals.  The Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at &euro;10.9 billion over the next 10 years.  This will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand.  Importantly, the accelerated introduction of additional capacity for 2018/2019 will be matched by forthcoming reforms including the publication of a detailed Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan and the overhaul of the current GP contract.</p>  <p>  Finally, a review of the Winter Initiative 2017/2018 is being undertaken, which will inform a 3 year plan for unscheduled care, as well as supporting the provision of additional capacity in Winter 2018/19.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to the Deputy's question on persons over 75 years of age, there are three main programmes focused on prioritising and improving the experience of patients over 75 in the emergency healthcare system.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Care Programme for Older People (ICPOP) and the National Clinical Programme for Older People (NCPOP) are developing integrated primary and secondary care services for older people. This involves establishing integrated multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) in both acute hospitals and CHOs to address the specific needs of older people (especially those who are frail or at risk of frailty); case management within MDTs linked to other services that coordinates and plans care needs across a continuum; and bespoke care pathways with appropriate expertise in older persons&rsquo; care.</p>  <p>  The Frailty at the Front Door (FFD) programme, which is the assertive case management of frail older patients deployed in acute hospitals (i.e. ED and MAUs) consists of timely identification and screening of older attendees to acute hospitals; comprehensive and early multidisciplinary team assessment; and assertive discharge with a coordinated response to the needs of frail older patients. </p></reply>

It aims to provide treatment over the coming years, across a range of healthcare settings, to all persons living with hepatitis C in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Programme Advisory Group provides oversight, advice, assurances and strategic direction to the Programme.  The group involves key stakeholders to ensure successful implementation of the multi-annual public health plan for the treatment of hepatitis C in Ireland over the coming years. In order to achieve this, the Programme has been allocated funding of &euro;30m each year since 2015.</p>  <p>  The Programme is also supported by a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG), which provides oversight and direction for decisions on clinical prioritisation and selection of appropriate drug treatment regimens.  The CAG includes healthcare professionals across a number of disciplines involved in the delivery of care to patients with hepatitis C.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP has provided treatment to more than 2000 patients in the hospital setting since 2015.  Access to treatment is currently open to all patients clinically prioritised, with no restrictions on availability.  The programme aims to treat 1500-1800 patients in 2018.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the NHCTP established a steering group which developed an integrated model of care for treatment across hospital and community services. In June 2017, for the initial phase of integrating hepatitis C treatment into community settings, the HSE began pilot treatment sites in 2 drug treatment centres in Dublin. These pilot sites support provision of treatment for patients who find it difficult to engage with the hospital based service.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP is continuing to monitor and evaluate these pilot programmes, to assess the suitability, feasibility, and sustainability of providing hepatitis C treatment in these settings on a larger scale.  It is understood that the HSE is developing plans for more sites in 2018, including prison and homeless services, in addition to developing existing shared care models currently being rolled out at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.</p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, in collaboration with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) of the Department of Health, published national clinical guidelines for hepatitis C screening in July 2017.</p>  <p>  The aim of the guidelines are to reduce the overall health and economic impact of hepatitis C infection and to contribute to the elimination of the virus as a public health concern in Ireland by 2030, by enhancing and further improving the screening of those at risk.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan for 2018 is committed to the continued development of integrated care models for hepatitis C treatment, in community and acute settings, and to the national clinical guidelines on hepatitis C screening.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-17a.484.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700065#WRR01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 190 together.</p>  <p>  Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide.  Mortality from cervical cancer in Ireland is above the European average.  In 2018 more than 90 Irish women will die from cervical cancer.  According to the World Health Organisation, which has reviewed international evidence, there is a strong association between HPV infection and the development of cervical cancer and that HPV vaccination is effective in preventing the development of cervical cancer.  There are over 100 types of HPV and around 40 types of HPV can infect the genital tract.  Some of these are low-risk types which cause genital warts, while others are high-risk types that are associated with the development of various cancers such as cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis and throat. Ninety nine percent (99%) of cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of certain high risk types of HPV.</p>  <p>  The introduction of HPV immunisation has had a significant impact in many parts of the world.  Countries with high vaccine uptake rates have seen the highest impact:</p>  <p>   - In Scotland where 90% of girls have been vaccinated since 2008 there has been a 90% fall in HPV infections in vaccinated girls;</p>  <p>   - Precancerous growths of the cervix have been reduced by more than 50% in countries such as Australia, Sweden and Scotland;</p>  <p>   - Finland recently published the evidence that HPV immunisation protects against invasive HPV-associated cancer.</p>  <p>  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme. It protects against HPV types 16 and 18 which cause seven in ten cases of cervical cancer, and types 6 and 11 which cause the majority of genital warts.  Gardasil has been authorised for use across the European Union since 2006 and has been used in over 25 European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  To date over 227 million doses have been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 730,000 doses of the vaccine have been distributed and more than 238,000 girls have received the full vaccine course.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  HPV is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  </p>  <p>  All medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks.  The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.</p>  <p>  In recent years the spread of inaccurate information on social media concerning the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine has had an impact on uptake rates.  </p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can do is to provide accurate and credible information to enable parents to make a fully informed decision concerning HPV vaccination.  The HSE National Immunisation Office developed a HPV website (hpv.ie) which has been endorsed by the WHO.  The focus must remain on increasing uptake rates as the best way of reducing cervical cancer, and I would encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important life-saving vaccine.</p>  <p>  You will recall that there was an extensive debate on the safety of the HPV vaccine and its efficacy in preventing the development of cervical cancer in this House on 28 March last in which a motion was passed unanimously which recognised that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine protects young girls from developing a cervical cancer when they grow up, supported the campaign to encourage parents to avail of the HPV vaccine for their children in their first year of secondary school, and which called for the programme to be extended to include boys.</p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority is undertaking a health technology assessment (HTA), at the request of the Department of Health, on extending the national immunisation schedule to include HPV vaccination of boys.  This HTA will establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of providing the vaccine to boys and I await the completion of the HTA later this year. </p></reply>

These provisions will apply to residential centres for persons with disabilities and nursing homes.  The provisions will also apply to mental health facilities in situations where a person has mental health issues but is not suffering from a mental disorder and therefore cannot be involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001.</p>  <p>  The deprivation of liberty proposals will apply in circumstances in which it is proposed that a relevant person is to live in, or is already living in, such facilities and</p>  <p>  (a)   is, or will be, under continuous supervision and control; and</p>  <p>  (b)   is not, or will not, be free to leave; and</p>  <p>  (c)   there is reason to believe that the person lacks capacity to make a decision to live in the  relevant facility.</p>  <p>  The approach taken in the Heads makes use of the decision-making procedures, supports and safeguards that already exist under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Heads also include some additional safeguards specific to deprivation of liberty.  The proposals build on the machinery of the Decision Support Service, which is provided for under this Act.  For that reason, it is not possible for the deprivation of liberty proposals to come into operation in advance of the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the operationalisation of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  The deprivation of liberty provisions will be brought forward as a stand-alone Bill and will add a new Part to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. My Department has worked closely with the Department of Justice and Equality in developing the proposals to ensure that the Heads align with this Act as well as meet our obligations under the UN Convention.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft legislative provisions formally closed on 9 March 2018 but submissions were accepted until 3 May.  The Department is currently analysing the 50 submissions received with a view to amending its draft Heads of Bill as necessary.  We intend to undertake this work as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that the system we are developing will work in practice and will provide sufficient safeguards in accordance with the requirements of international law, domestic law and relevant jurisprudence.  </p>  <p>  To assist with this process, an advisory group has been convened to consider the findings of the public consultation process, to advise on any appropriate amendments to the draft Heads of Bill and to ensure that the approach taken integrates effectively with existing legislation.  </p></reply>

The situation changed quickly following storm Emma in March and fodder shortages spread to the South and remaining parts of the country.  At this point, following consultation with Teagasc and industry representatives, importation of fodder was considered necessary to address domestic shortages.  As a result, a Fodder Import Support measure was introduced in the first week of April to complement the more locally based Fodder Transport Support measure.</p>  <p>  These two interventions working together effectively addressed issues around fodder availability in the country.  Grass growth, as confirmed by Teagasc assessments, has continued to improve significantly and livestock are out to graze.  However, ground conditions were slow to improve in some areas and in a concluding response to remaining fodder difficulties it was decided to extend both measures by one week until 7th May.</p></reply>

The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 17 schemes.  I have made very considerable funds available to the seafood sector in 2018 through a range of EMFF schemes.  In doing so, I secured a very significant commitment from the Exchequer to the EMFF Programme.  However, this means that there are no other sources of funds available to me, other than the EMFF, to assist the sector with any support requirements.</p>  <p>  The EMFF Regulation (508/2014) provides for a special compensation scheme for fishermen experiencing significant economic losses arising from severe storms etc.  Article 35 foresees the establishment by fishermen of a 'Mutual Fund for Adverse Climatic Events and Environmental Incidents'.  This Fund would act as a form of mutual insurance for otherwise uninsurable losses, by paying compensation to affiliated fishermen for losses that exceed 30% of the fisherman's annual turnover arising from severe storms and other adverse climatic events, for losses arising from environmental incidents and for the costs of rescue at sea for fishermen or fishing vessels.  The Fund must be established and managed by fishermen and be funded through the subscriptions of affiliated fishermen.  The compensation would only be available to fishermen affiliated to the Fund.  Support to the Fund from the EMFF Programme would be in the form of a contribution to the costs of compensation paid out by the Fund.  Depending on the type of vessels or fishermen experiencing losses, EMFF assistance may be as high as 80%.  To date, no fishing representatives have proposed to me that they wish to take on responsibility for the establishment of a Mutual Fund.  I cannot lawfully establish the Fund on behalf of the sector.  When appropriate representatives of the sector are in a position to establish the Fund, my Department and BIM stand ready to assist and advise fishermen and their representatives in any way possible.  However, the EMFF does not permit a financial contribution towards the costs of establishment or management of the Fund.  In order for such a Fund to be viable, it is likely to be necessary for the fishing sector to strongly support the initiative through widespread affiliation.  </p></reply>

This inspection, which included a field visit to determine the position on the ground, identified over-declarations in area exceeding 10% of the area claimed.  This resulted in the area determined being reduced by 1.5 times the difference between the area claimed and area determined, as required under the governing EU regulations.  The final position was that no payment was due under the 2017 Basic Payment/Areas of Natural Constraints Schemes.  A letter detailing the final outcome of the inspection issued on 6 February 2018.</p>  <p>  A review of the case was requested and this was referred to the local inspectorate for examination.

This cycle training, which includes an on-road element, will result, over time, in an increase in the number of responsible cyclists on our roads.

Projects funded under the Smarter Travel programme involved integrated initiatives across a number of aspects of active/smarter travel and incorporated measures such as investment in cycle lanes, bike parking, footpaths, traffic calming measures, shared streets and other interventions that encourage and support modal shift to walking and cycling. </p>  <p>  In addition since 2010 my Department has also provided funding to the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the Sustainable Transport Measures Grants (STMG) Programme and the Regional Cities Programme to implement sustainable transport projects, including providing cycling infrastructure, in the Greater Dublin Area and the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  Therefore, for the period 2011 to 2017 it is not possible at this time to isolate specific expenditure on cycling infrastructure alone.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Budget 2018 I managed to secure over &euro;110m in capital funding which is specifically allocated to develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford over the period 2018-2021.  This programme will provide "active travel" (i.e. cycling and walking) routes, which can help alleviate congestion by improving the viability of these particular forms of travel, and doing so in a way that provides useful connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.  Allocation of funding and details of individual projects are managed by the National Transport Authority in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.  In addition to this, &euro;55m will be spent in this same four year period on Greenways outside of the 5 cities, and the greenway programme will be largely aimed at providing an enhanced tourism and leisure amenity.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;135m capital funding has been allocated over this same period for investment in Sustainable Urban Transport projects.  These will include projects that will provide either direct or indirect improvements for urban cycling.  This programme builds on investment to date to deliver improvements in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the regional cities and the GDA.  It includes traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects, which will allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and will help relieve traffic congestion.  Again, allocation of funding and details of individual projects are managed by the National Transport Authority in conjunction with the relevant local authorities. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, investment of more than &euro;750m on the BusConnects Programme in the same period, will deliver a transformative investment package that will finance new and expanded bus routes, greatly improve bus access, and includes designated segregated cycle lanes.</p>  <p>  In addition to funding for the provision of infrastructure, my Department continues to be very active in promoting behavioural change to encourage more people to take up cycling and to cycle safely.  We provide funding to the NTA on an annual basis for the delivery of behavioural change programmes such as Workplace and Campus travel programmes and the Green Schools Programmes.  My Department also engaged Cycling Ireland to develop a new national cycle training standard - "Cycle Right" &ndash; which was rolled out in January 2017 to approximately 15,000 primary school students.  My Department supports the great work that is being done by RSA in the promotion of safe roads for all road users, including the more vulnerable users such as cyclists and pedestrians.  In addition my Department provides funding to local authorities throughout the country to assist in organising events and activities during Bike Week which further serve to promote cycling.</p>  <p>  As part of an overall coordinated approach to the provision of an integrated sustainable transport network of cycling, walking and public transport, these various investments will support and lead to a further increase in the numbers cycling safely, thereby easing congestion, improving public health and enhancing the liveability of our towns and cities; the investment will, I believe, have a lasting transformative effect on our transport network over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The detailed information requested by the Deputy is currently being compiled by programme and local authority and will be forwarded in due course in line with Standing Orders. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s schemes, including the Fuel Allowance scheme, are constantly reviewed to ensure that they are fulfilling their objectives.  Recent changes to the scheme which helped increase its effectiveness include extending the duration of the scheme to 27 weeks and the introduction of an option for qualified households to receive their fuel allowance payment in two lump sums, thereby allowing people to buy fuel in bulk and potentially avail of special offers or discounts on the purchase of the particular fuel that meets their specific needs. </p>  <p>  Fuel allowance is not the sole income support mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with special or additional heating needs.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package at an estimated cost of &euro;237 million in 2018.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.  Exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  </p>  <p>  Income support is only part of the answer in terms of addressing fuel poverty.  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment have a very valuable role to play in that regard.  Furthermore, that Department also has responsibility for the Government&rsquo;s main approach to this issue, contained in &ldquo;A Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty 2016-2019&rdquo; which is available on that Department&rsquo;s website at www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/energy/publications/Pages/Strategy-to-combat-energy-poverty.aspx.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of supports, investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  Consequently any decisions made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation.  The provisions of the Pensions Act are enforced through the supervision of the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  Although the Pensions Authority is under the aegis of my Department, it regulates pension schemes entirely independently of my Department.  Therefore, I am not in a position to directly intervene in individual pension schemes and it would not be appropriate for me to meet with unions regarding such schemes.</p>  <p>  If scheme members or Deputies have concerns about any such pension scheme they should address queries directly to the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme.</p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.</p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the minimum funding standard.</p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June. With the cooperation of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This can be challenging because of the complexities of the application process and the amount of information needed.  However my Department recognises that the current wait time must be improved and is working to achieve this.

Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme.</p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.</p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard. </p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June. With the cooperation of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme.</p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.</p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard. </p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June. With the cooperation of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A total of 247 adults and 331 children were removed from the report with the agreement of the relevant authorities.  My Department does not have details of the numbers of families involved.  In the case of Louth and Dublin, the accommodation consisted of private houses/apartments rented by the local authorities; in the case of Waterford, Limerick and Kerry, the accommodation involved was local authority housing. </p>  <p>  My priority as Minister is to ensure that families and individuals are moved from emergency accommodation, such as hostels, hotels and family hubs, into housing.  I am satisfied that individuals and families who are being accommodated in publicly funded houses or apartments, whether it be social housing or homes leased from the private rented sector, should not be considered as living in emergency accommodation.  </p>  <p>  The issues which have emerged indicate clearly to me  that we need improved reporting in this area in order to accurately reflect the numbers of households in emergency accommodation so that we can measure our progress and target our further policies and actions.

It is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Insurance Committee, a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) with representatives from the CCMA, local authorities and the Housing Finance Agency, as well as my Department. </p>  <p>  The local authority MPI offers a number of additional features over and above the standard MPI products available on the market.  Standard MPI products are individually priced, based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement, offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.  The scheme also provides other benefits over standard MPI products.  These include the payment of mortgage repayments if there is a valid claim as a result of disability; an additional payment of &euro;3,000 in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, separate to life cover; and members are also covered for death up to age 75 rather than 65 as is the case under standard MPI cover.</p>  <p>  The scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986.  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p>  <p>  The insurance scheme is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering, in accordance with the terms of EU Directives relating to the award of public service contracts.  This is to ensure that the most appropriate cover at the best value for money is secured for local authority borrowers over the entire life of their mortgages.</p>  <p>  Regarding the information available to prospective applicants on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website, I am aware of previous issues concerning the inclusion of the cost of MPI in the on-line calculator.  This has recently been amended in order to take the cost of mortgage protection insurance into account, and will therefore give potential applicants a clearer indication of the amount that they could be eligible to borrow under the scheme.</p></reply>

The provision and allocation of social housing are matters for local authorities in accordance with their allocation scheme.  Accordingly, my Department does not collect data from local authorities on their allocations to individual categories of applicant.  </p><p>Planning authorities are however required, under section 94 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to include a housing strategy in their development plans which must outline the authorities&rsquo; plans for the existing and future housing needs of the population of their areas.  The strategy must include provisions to ensure that a mixture of house types and sizes is developed to reasonably match the requirements of the different categories of households including the special requirements of people with disabilities.  Housing strategies must also have regard to relevant policies or objectives of the Government.  In that context and building on the Programme for Partnership Government commitment to meet the housing needs of people with a disability, the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (NHSPWD) 2011-2016 was affirmed in Rebuilding Ireland and extended to 2020 to continue to deliver on its aims.  </p><p>In accordance with the vision and strategic aims of the NHSPWD to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level, Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) have been established in all local authority areas.  These are chaired by the Directors of Housing with membership including the HSE and disability representatives.  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet the identified and emerging housing needs of people with disabilities in their areas with a view to developing annual targets for the delivery of housing to people with a disability on their housing waiting lists.  All Plans are now operational in each local authority with the majority already published on the relevant local authority websites.  These Plans, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), will allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing mechanisms.  I have instructed all local authorities to be cognisant of the needs identified under the SSHA process as they work on delivery to meet the targets set for them by my Department over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland contains specific commitments to meet the housing needs of the vulnerable in our society.  The needs of people with disabilities and older people are specifically addressed through targeted funding such as the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS).  This scheme provides funding of up to 100% of project costs advanced by local authorities to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to provide accommodation for specific categories of people, including people with a disability.  A provision of &euro;88.8 million is available for the scheme this year.  My Department also provides funding for necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works to the houses of people with disabilities and older people in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs, and to facilitate the continued occupancy of their own home for as long as possible.  Rebuilding Ireland<i></i>has committed to increasing the funding available for these grants and funding has increased year on year since 2014.  A total of &euro;66.25 million is available for these schemes in 2018, comprising &euro;53 million exchequer funding, which is an increase of 11% on the 2017 figure, with the balance of &euro;13.25 million coming from local authority resources.  Further consideration will be given to increasing this funding over the coming years.  In addition, under the Disabled Persons Grants (DPG) scheme, funding is provided to local authorities for adaptations and extensions to the existing social housing stock to meet the needs of older local authority tenants and people with a disability.  In 2017 funding of &euro;13.1 million was recouped to local authorities supporting improvements in over 1,300 homes.  Local authorities have recently submitted details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this scheme in 2018.  These are currently being assessed and funding allocations will be notified to local authorities shortly.  </p><p>The supports put in place since the launch of the NHSPWD in 2011, together with the commitments and substantial funding provided by my Department under Rebuilding Ireland<i>,</i>point to continuing tangible progress being made in respect of housing for people with disabilities and accord with the Programme for Government commitment to improve the lives of people with a disability.</p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. </p><p>Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including 3,500 homes targeted using the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), and 6,500 homes using a  combination of the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced Lease Scheme.  All homes delivered under leasing arrangements, including a new Enhanced Leasing Scheme, will be funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  </p><p>It is intended that up to 2,000 units will be leased by Local Authorities in 2018 through a combination of the existing Long Term Leasing arrangements, the Repair and Leasing Scheme and the new Enhanced Leasing Scheme.</p><p>The new Enhanced Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives. </p><p>The new Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.  There are, however, a number of key differences between the existing long term lease and the enhanced lease, the purpose of which is to facilitate larger levels of private investment in social housing while ensuring that the capital investment is off balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure. </p><p>The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities.  The Housing Agency will manage and administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator. </p><p>A call for proposals was launched on 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018.  All proposals are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the &ldquo;Calls for Proposals for Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme&rdquo; and the proposals will be assessed and marked in accordance with the terms set out therein.  The Call for Proposals is available on the Housing Agency website at the following link:<i>www.housingagency.ie/News/Current-News/Enhanced-Long-Term-Social-Housing-Leasing-Scheme.aspx.</i></p><p>A total of 33 submissions were received from interested parties which represents strong interest from the market.  The Housing Agency is currently reviewing the proposals and will complete the initial review process in the coming weeks.  The total number of units proposed is still being worked through as part of the assessment process and will be the subject of an agreement between the individual Local Authorities and proposers.</p><p>Further information with respect to the numbers and locations of the units proposed for leasing under the Scheme will only be available once the individual proposals have been assessed, marked and accepted in accordance with the terms and methodology set out in the Calls for Proposals document.</p></reply>

The current number of MEPs in the European Parliament is 750 plus the President with each Member State having between 6 and 96 Members.</p><p>Council Decision 2013/312/EU provided that it would be revised again in advance of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term upon an initiative of the European Parliament to be presented to the European Council before the end of 2016.  The launch of this process was, however, postponed by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Constitutional Affairs (i.e. the AFCO Committee) until after the referendum in the United Kingdom on its withdrawal from the European Union.</p><p>Following a report in the matter by the AFCO Committee, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on 7 February 2018 which contains a <i>Proposal for a Decision of the European Council establishing the composition of the European Parliament</i>.  In broad terms, the proposal provides, among other things, that:</p><p>­  when the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union becomes legally effective, 27 of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s 73 seats would be re-distributed among 14 Member States, of which 2 would go to Ireland, increasing Ireland&rsquo;s MEPs from 11 to 13 in number.  This would mean a reduction in the overall size of the European Parliament from 751 to 705 members;  </p><p>-  however, as set out in the Parliament's resolution, if the date on which the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union becomes legally effective takes place after the European Parliament elections are held in mid-2019, the number of MEPs to be elected from each Member State for the 2019-2024 parliamentary term would remain the same as that of the current parliament.  The additional seats would only be filled on the date after which the United Kingdom's withdrawal becomes legally effective.</p><p>The proposal, which will require unanimity, is now under consideration within the European Council; the consent of the Parliament will be sought by the Council by way of written procedure.  Subject to the consent of the European Parliament, it is anticipated that the proposal will be adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 28 June 2018.</p><p>In the event that Ireland&rsquo;s total number of seats in the European Parliament is changed in respect of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term, it will be necessary to review our European constituency arrangements.  Under section 5(1A) of the Electoral Act 1997, provision is made for the establishment of a Constituency Commission in such circumstances to review, and report with recommendations on, European Parliament constituencies.  This was done in 2013 prior to the last elections to the European Parliament.</p></reply>

The RLS was established on a pilot basis in Waterford and Carlow local authorities in October 2016 and expanded nationwide from 23 February 2017. </p><p>The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant dwellings, who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their dwellings up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the dwelling for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB). </p><p>At the end of 2017, a total of 820 applications had been received under the scheme. Local authorities were engaging with the property owners in relation to 573 properties, 31 agreements for lease had been signed and 9 homes had been delivered and tenanted. A detailed breakdown of the RLS scheme data up to end Q4 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.</i></p><p>It is clear from the end 2017 output that RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged.  I have reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and I have concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective.  At the second Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, I announced a number of key changes to the scheme which took effect from 1 February 2018.  These include:</p><p>-  a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p><p>-  an increase in the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and</p><p>-  provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and AHBs to continue to implement the scheme locally.</p><p>Over the period 2016 to 2021, the national target is for the delivery of an additional 50,000 social housing homes through Build, Acquisition and Leasing Schemes.  The ambition is for 33,500 of these homes to be delivered through new build programmes including Part V; for 6,500 to be delivered through Acquisition programmes including the Housing Agency Acquisition Programme; and for the remaining 10,000 homes to be delivered under a range of leasing initiatives including the RLS.  Out of the total 10,000 homes to be delivered under Leasing, it is expected that 2,000 will be leased by local authorities in 2018 under a range of leasing initiatives, including the Repair and Leasing Scheme, long term leasing and the new Enhanced Lease.</p><p>I wrote to all Local Authorities on 18 April 2018 setting out their social housing delivery targets for Build, Acquisition and Leasing for 2018, and for the period 2018-2021.

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also empowered under the Wildlife Acts and European Communities Regulations to investigate alleged offences and to prosecute if they see fit. </p>  <p>  Of my Department&rsquo;s total staff, I understand that some 330 work in the area of natural heritage through the NPWS of my Department.  In addition, my Department takes on in the region of 70 seasonal staff during the year to assist the NPWS. Frontline conservation Rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of Departmental business needs and priorities.  </p>  <p>  Within this staffing context, officials of my Department carry out scientific research, survey work and monitor compliance with national and European law in relation to nature conservation across the country.  They conduct patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation, as required, and many of these officers carry out work in more than one county.  They also investigate reports of breaches of legislation including illegal snaring of badgers, hare lurching as well monitoring compliance at coursing events etc.  Staffing levels across my Department are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Department of Defence already assists my Department in the provision of aerial monitoring of certain sites and habitats and my Department will continue to liaise with that Department in providing assistance in investigating breaches of wildlife legislation.</p>  <p>  I would point out that since 2015 my Department has brought over 50 separate prosecutions for breaches of wildlife legislation.  These prosecutions have include illegal badger baiting, hare lurching, deer hunting, poisoning and shooting of endangered bird species as well as illegally cutting hedges and burning vegetation.  My Department will continue our covert actions with other agencies, including An Garda Siochana and the I.S.P.C.A to counteract all illegal activities.</p></reply>
