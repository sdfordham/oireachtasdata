    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-19a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121900064#WRA00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 17 together.</p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the regulation of medicines in Ireland. It works with all stakeholders, including the industry and law enforcement agencies, to ensure as far as possible that counterfeit or falsified medicines do not reach the public. </p><p>  IMB enforcement officers work in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Customs Service throughout the year to detect counterfeit and illegal medicines coming into the State and to investigate instances of illegal supply of medicines over the Internet from retail outlets not authorised to supply medicines, or illegal supply of medicines on the illicit market. Prosecutions have been brought by the IMB and by the DPP against persons breaching regulations under the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995-2006 relating to the unauthorised manufacture, importation and supply of medicines, to protect public health and protect against the health risks associated with counterfeit medicines.</p><p>  Falsified medicines represent a serious threat to global health and call for a comprehensive strategy both at European and international level. The IMB is part of a global rapid alert system on medicines in the authorised supply chain, which monitors and acts on reports of counterfeit medicines that are detected in the supply chain from the manufacturer through to the patient. The IMB participates in two further rapid alert systems, one EU and one global, which deal with counterfeit medicines in illegal markets and pharmaceutical crimes.</p><p>   For the last five years the IMB, Revenue Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have participated in a unified interagency operational approach in Ireland called Operation PANGEA. This is an international initiative coordinated by Interpol, to tackle the internet supply of counterfeit and illegal medicines. The principal focus of Operation PANGEA is the protection of public health. The IMB is represented on the global organising committee for this operation. The activity conducted during this operation is ongoing throughout the year in Ireland with the Revenue Customs Service detecting illegal supplies of medicines at ports and airports and working with Garda&iacute; in investigations to identify criminal activity and prevent harmful internet-supplied medicines getting to unsuspecting members of the public purchasing online. </p><p>  Memoranda of Understanding exist between State agencies to support this collaborative approach to combating counterfeit medicines, such as that between the IMB and Revenue Customs Service. The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, provides that Revenue Customs Service officers have enforcement powers under the Act to enable them to adequately respond to instances of illegal importation of medicines, medical devices and other healthcare products. This has proven to be a very positive approach and is evidenced by the amounts of illegal medicines detained annually at the entry points to the State. Further, the Garda&iacute; continually work to identify supply lines of controlled drugs in order to prevent them getting into the drug abuse market. </p><p>  To date, no counterfeit medicines have been detected in the legitimate medicines supply chain in Ireland. However several instances of counterfeit medicines have been found in the UK and other EU countries over the last ten years even though these countries have been active in taking significant steps to deter this activity. </p><p>  At an EU level, it is recognised that, as falsifications become more sophisticated, the risk to EU patients increases every year. The new Falsified Medicines Directive, Directive 2011/62/EU, will come into effect from the 2nd January 2013. The transposition of the Directive into Irish law is in progress. This new legislation will further tighten the regulatory regime to prevent the possibility of infiltration of counterfeit medicines into medicines wholesalers and pharmacies and is intended to further protect patients. It introduces tougher rules to improve the protection of public health with new harmonised, pan-European measures to ensure that medicines are safe and that the trade in medicines is rigorously controlled. These new measures include:</p><p>-An obligatory authenticity feature on the outer packaging of key medicines;</p><p>-A common, EU-wide logo to identify legal online pharmacies and make it easier to distinguish between legal and illegal online pharmacies throughout the European Union;-Tougher rules on the controls and inspections of producers of active pharmaceutical ingredients; and</p><p>-Strengthened record-keeping requirements for wholesale distributors.</p><p>  These new measures will be progressively introduced over the next few years.</p><p>  The public can be assured that the area of counterfeit medicines is constantly under review. The different State agencies, in particular the IMB, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Customs Service, are working in a cooperative manner to deter, detect and investigate instances of illegality regarding medicines and will continue to do so.</p></reply>

Under the new arrangements, it is envisaged that 92% of the over 70's will retain their medical cards.  </p><p>  At present, people over 70 are entitled to a medical card if their income is less than &euro;700 per week for a single person or &euro;1,400 for a couple.  In line with measures announced in Budget 2013, the income limits are being reduced to &euro;600 a week for an individual and &euro;1,200 a week for a couple.  This will mean that a single person with an income under &euro;600 per week or a couple with an income under &euro;1,200 per week, will still qualify for a medical card. If a single person has an income of between &euro;600 and &euro;700 per week, or a couple has an income of between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400 per week, they will qualify for a GP visit card instead of a medical card.  People who lose the medical card will be entitled to make use of the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) which reimburses the cost of medication that exceeds a monthly threshold.</p></reply>

The core of the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme is a single-tier health service, supported by Universal Health Insurance and designed in accordance with the principles of social solidarity.  Future Health sets out the building blocks towards the introduction of UHI and maps out 48 time defined actions that will be taken to achieve the Government&rsquo;s objectives.   </p><p>Future Health   is founded on:</p><p>- A new focus on health and wellbeing  , moving away from simply treating ill people to a new concentration on keeping people healthy;</p><p>- Reforming our primary, hospital and social care services   so we deliver care at the lowest level of complexity; </p><p>- Reforming our structures   so we deliver services effectively and efficiently; and</p><p>- Reforming our financial systems   so we can enhance financial control and create the incentive to deliver cost effective care.</p><p>I am determined to maintain access and quality during the reform process.  We must address huge financial challenges while keeping services safe and of high quality.  For this reason, Future Health   proposes that change be implemented in a step by step manner on the basis of good evidence.  </p><p>I recognise that effective consultation and collaboration with stakeholders will be crucial for the successful implementation of the reform programme.  In the two weeks following the launch of Future Health,   I met with some 1,500 local clinical and administrative staff and management as well as regional health forums at fifteen different events across the four HSE regions.  I was accompanied by my Department and by the HSE Director General designate of the HSE.   This proved to be a very valuable and worthwhile exercise as it allowed me to outline my plans directly to frontline staff and management, and to engage in productive discussion and debate on health service reform.  </p><p>The actions in Future Health are already being implemented as a matter of priority and I will ensure that this progress continues next year.    I am confident that with the involvement and support of all of the main stakeholders in the health system, we can deliver on our objectives in the best interest of patients.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-19a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121900064#WRA01200"><p>The Government remains firmly committed to supporting vulnerable older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Mainstream Home Help and enhanced Home Care Package services are core to not only supporting vulnerable older people's preferred wishes, but also to reducing pressures elsewhere in the wider care system. The demand for these services, and for additional community based supports such as Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care, will continue as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.</p><p>  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of home support services is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times.  Notwithstanding the recent reduction in HSE home support provision towards the end of this year, to address overall urgent funding pressures, investment in these services will still be significant. All measures are taken by the HSE to ensure that as many people as possible receive a prioritised service, in line with assessed individual needs. </p><p>  The matters raised by the Deputy are being considered at present in the context of finalising the HSE Service Plan for next year. This is due be published in the near future, in line with agreed procedures and time frames. However, as clearly indicated recently in relation to Social Care services under Budget 2013,  the Government will next year restore to 2012 levels core provision of home help, home care packages and personal assistant hours. As is the case with all aspects of HSE Service Plans, these services will be reviewed on a regular basis, in the context of achieving agreed targets or taking account of evolving circumstances over the course of 2013.  The Local Health Offices will continue to allocate and monitor services as normal. This includes, at individual recipient level, regular assessment and reviews, to ensure that prioritised resources are directed towards the most vulnerable.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding these challenges, the Government agreed to provide the Health Group of Votes with an additional &euro;150m over and above the expenditure ceiling set last year.</p><p>  In respect of next year, Gross Expenditure under the Health Group of Votes will be &euro;14,024 million in 2013. This will consist of &euro;13,627 million in current expenditure and &euro;397 million in capital expenditure. The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding will be set out in the HSE National Service Plan. The Plan will also set out the measures required to fund unavoidable pressures and commitments made under the Programme for Government. In line with the Programme for Government funding will be allocated to further develop mental health services and provide free GP care for persons with certain conditions. </p><p>  As I have outlined in this House on previous occasions, I have instructed the HSE that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected, and in this regard patient safety must be paramount. During 2012 my Department undertook a number of initiatives to address concerns around financial control in the Health Service Executive. These included engaging an expert from the UK NHS to examine the financial management of the HSE and make recommendations regarding strengthening and improving the management of its finances. An assessment of this report and an action plan for the implementation of its recommendations, was also undertaken by PA Consulting. Both reports will be published shortly.</p><p>  As regards regular monitoring of expenditure, there is intensive engagement between officials from my Department and the HSE each month. My Department provides detailed analysis each month on expenditure trends to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and there is regular engagement between officials from that Department, my own Department and the HSE.  The Executive is managed by each Regional Director, both financially and service delivery wise,  within a national framework, with the information collated by the Corporate Planning &amp; Performance Directorate of the HSE. This consolidated information forms the basis of its Performance Report, which the Deputy will be aware, is published every month. The Report provides an overall analysis of key performance data from Finance, HR, Hospital and Primary &amp; Community Services. The activity data reported is based on Performance Activity and Key Performance Indicators outlined in the HSE National Service Plan. A Supplementary Report is also produced each month which provides more detailed data on the metrics covered in the Performance Report. The October Performance Report is due to be published this week, and will be available on the HSEs website - www.hse.ie</p><p>  My Department and the HSE is working collaboratively with PA Consulting on a Financial Improvement Programme with a view to strengthening the Executive's financial and performance management and reporting systems during 2013.</p></reply>

Their report was presented to me on 8 June this year. On Tuesday 6 November, I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the campus of St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  In identifying the new site, the Government has carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.  </p><p>  This decision has been made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations being of paramount importance. Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.</p><p>  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  This Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  Until then, the HSE will continue to support the existing children's hospital who will continue to operate and provide services to patients within the current agreed Service Plans. I have already signalled that the three hospitals will become a single Hospital Group in the near future, and my Department is examining the necessary arrangements to support this. </p><p>  In parallel, I am moving to put in place the necessary structures and governance arrangements to enable the delivery of the capital  project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.  I will bring a Memorandum for Government on these issues to Cabinet shortly.  Pending this, work is progressing in relation to the site and site preparation, while a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and a time-limited review of Dublin maternity services configuration is to commence as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  </p><p>  I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013.  An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  </p><p>  I recently announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply in 2013 at the Committee Stage debate in the D&aacute;il on this Bill.  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person. The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit. The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young. This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care. </p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down both the cost of health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible, and the general cost of healthcare delivery, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.  In February of this year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model. I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.  </p><p>  In this regard, VHI has commissioned consultants to carry out an external review of their claims.  The review is nearing completion and will look at the opportunities and costs involved in possible reductions in utilisation that can be achieved by implementing appropriate utilisation management approaches. </p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

Greece and Portugal were the countries which were lower.  The type of prices included in the health category  include medical products, appliances and equipment, hospital charges and out patient services supplied by doctors, dentists, opticians, physiotherapists and practitioners of alternative and complimentary medicine. </p><p>  The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for November 2012 indicates that Ireland has the second highest inflation rate in health care cost in EU 15 except for  Netherlands over the last 6 years. However, figures for the UK are not available, but it is normally slightly above Ireland which would indicate that Ireland has the third highest rate.  </p><p>The HICP is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, which is designed to measure the change in the average level of prices (inclusive of all indirect taxes) paid for consumer goods and services by all   private households in the country and by foreign tourists holidaying in Ireland. Therefore it does not reflect price changes in the cost to the Health Service Executive of providing treatment.  As the Deputy will be aware, very significant reductions in the cost of human resources, medications and in fees paid to professionals have been achieved in Ireland over the last few years - however, these are not comprehended within the HICP.</p></reply>

The HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.</p><p>  There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed. Details of this procedure have been made available to all GPs and Social Workers. Such applications can be initiated through the Local Health office whose manager has access to a dedicated fax and e-mail contact line to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS).Once the medical condition is verified by a GP or a consultant, and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.</p></reply>

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including: significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions; and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represent the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines are due to be reduced on 1 January next in accordance with the agreement.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria: the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item; the value for money afforded by the relevant item; the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed; the prices of therapeutically similar items; and the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market.</p></reply>

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. Reform across the three domains of access, quality and resources is not achievable unless there is real clinical and managerial accountability at hospital level.</p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery. Hospital groups will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. </p><p>  With specific regard to the South East, I have stated on numerous occasions recently that Waterford Regional Hospital will remain as one of the 8 existing national cancer care programme centres, with the same population referral base for cancer patients and with all of the associated services required to support this, such as joint consultant appointments (e.g. general surgery shared with Wexford).  I have also reiterated that other services currently provided in Waterford, such as invasive cardiology and trauma services will continue to be provided there. The provision of services at any hospital site will, of course, primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within a reasonable commute.</p><p>  Last June I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions. A Project Team was established to make recommendations to the Strategic Board on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. </p><p>  The Project Team is currently finalising a Report on the recommendations outlined above, taking account of the observations and comments made by the Strategic Board and of issues which have been raised in submissions by a number of key stakeholders. The report is to be presented formally to me in early January. I will consider it  and I will have any further consultation I require carried out as a matter of urgency. The report will then be presented to Government for decision on the  composition of hospital groups in light of the recommendations of the Report.</p></reply>

The SDU was set up immediately following the Minister&rsquo;s appointment and the initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For children, the target is that by the end of 2012 no child should be waiting for inpatient or daycase treatment for more than 20 weeks. Huge progress has been made towards this target &ndash; on 13 December, there were just 234 children waiting longer than 20 weeks compared with 1,759 at the end of December 2011.  Improving access to outpatient services is the next priority for the Government. Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

To date 17 posts have been filled and over 270 offers of employment have already been accepted and the appointments are proceeding.  Most start dates are expected to commence this month and costs will start to be incurred from that point.   The full year costs of all of the above measures will be incurred from 2013 onwards.</p><p>  The provisional outturn for mental health services has, like many other areas, been running ahead of budget and the end of year excess in this area will be met from the unexpended portion of the &euro;35 million.  It is not possible to say yet exactly how much of the &euro;35 million will be spent on mental health services by the end of this financial year.   The announcement in Budget 2013 of a further &euro;35 million for the continued development of our mental health services is additional to the &euro;35 million provided in Budget 2012.  I will be engaging fully with the Health Service Executive to ensure that the developments to be put in place for this additional funding are reflected in the National Service Plan for 2013.  Developments are expected to include the further strengthening of Community Mental Health Teams for adults, children &amp; adolescents, older people, Mental Health Intellectual Disabilities Teams and a suicide prevention initiatives programme.</p></reply>

The HSE has had regular ongoing engagement with the hospital with a view to ensuring that the hospital  continues to deliver its 2012 service plan commitments in addition to maximising the considerable financial resources at its disposal.</p><p>  Tallaght hospital has achieved significant operational savings in 2012 and has reduced its year-on-year spending by 6%, despite a 5% increase in in-patient numbers, a 6% increase in Emergency Department admissions and a 9% reduction in its 2012 allocation.  Tallaght has achieved HSE targets for reductions in agency and overtime costs and its absenteeism is consistently lower than the HSE national target. It has also considerably reduced the average length of stay times and ED, inpatient and day case waiting times as well as practically eliminating hospital trolleys. The hospital&rsquo;s staff has displayed great commitment to improving its performance and I am confident that this commitment will greatly assist in addressing Tallaght's current financial difficulties.</p><p>  The use of overdraft facilities in the latter half of the year is part of the normal financing arrangements with voluntary hospitals.

Other studies have cited figures which suggest that Ireland has a more favourable nurse-to-patient ratio than the United Kingdom. </p><p>  At present, some 1650 nurses/midwives graduate per annum from our Universities and other colleges. The Department of Health has recently completed a review of undergraduate nursing and midwifery education programmes. As part of this review an analysis of the number of student places required to ensure sufficient numbers of nurse and midwife graduates was completed. This indicates that the overall numbers of students at undergraduate level meets demand.</p><p>  The Government has determined that, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced substantially in 2013 and 2014.  Spending on health services will also have to be very tightly controlled. The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years represents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  The priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a safe, more productive and cost-effective health system. </p><p>  Directors of Nursing/Midwifery will continue to examine closely improvements in flexible working arrangements, changes to rosters, changes to the role of staff and other approaches to address any impact on patient safety and the quality of care. The capacity for specialist practice in nursing has been expanded in recent years with a view to ensuring high quality safe patient care. This includes developing clinical specialists, advanced practitioners and enhancing the role of staff nurses and midwives through the development of initiatives such as ordering x-rays and prescribing of medicinal products.</p><p>  The Croke Park Agreement has been crucial to the health service&rsquo;s ability to manage through the very difficult circumstances of recent years.  The flexibility and adaptability shown by staff has meant that even with reducing staff numbers, service levels have largely been maintained and indeed performance in relation to Emergency Departments and hospital waiting lists has markedly improved.</p><p>  The continued reduction in staffing increases the need for reform and the HSE is committed to fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reduced resources under the Croke Park Agreement.</p><p>In this regard, I have recently approved recruitment of up to 1,000 graduate nurses on two-year contracts under   a Placement Scheme for Graduate Nurses and Midwives that will support the retention of qualified graduates within the Irish health system. </p><p>  The HSE will be proceeding to put this scheme into effect and will be inviting applications early in 2013. Under the scheme, graduate nurses/midwives will be able to gain valuable work experience post graduation, benefiting from mentoring and skills development. </p><p>  The scheme will facilitate a reduction the use of agency staffing and overtime and support service delivery.</p></reply>

Information on locations progressing will be published in the Executive's 2013 National Service Plan.</p><p>  The current position with regard to the PPP initiative for primary care infrastructure, the current position is that the HSE is engaging with the NDFA as required to progress the programme. The HSE is currently analysing the available sites in each location and engaging with the GPs in each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.  The HSE has commenced the procurement of design teams and technical advisors to progress the design and planning submissions for the primary care centre sites and the preparation of the PPP procurement documents.   Up to 20 of the 35 locations announced will be offered to the market subject to a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres and b) site suitability and availability.

Under UHI, every individual will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. The new UHI system will be underpinned by a robust legislative  framework and grounded in principles of open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating  .  </p><p>  In moving to a system of UHI,  there are  a number of key stepping stones  that are necessary to  pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance including: the strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients; the work of the Special Delivery Unit in tackling waiting times and establishing hospital groups, and the introduction of a more transparent and efficient &quot;Money Follows the Patient&quot; funding mechanism for hospitals. </p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years. The Programme for Government acknowledges that full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2016   highlights the importance of a step-by-step evidence-based approach to achieving an effective, equitable and efficient system. Work on the critical building blocks is underway and it is anticipated that by 2016 much of the necessary groundwork will be in place to ensure that we are well placed to  proceed with  implementation of UHI. </p><p>  Finally, in designing the future UHI system and associated legal and regulatory framework, it is important to acknowledge that, as is the case with all countries, we must make choices in meeting healthcare demands with finite resources.

The scheme is also intended to contribute to a reduction in expenditure on agency staffing and overtime in the health service.  The HSE is proceeding with arrangements to finalise the details of the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, and will be inviting applications early in 2013.

I intend to submit these proposals to the Government for consideration and approval as soon as possible.  I emphasise that these proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including the areas mentioned by the Deputy, such as legislation on minimum unit pricing, which is about setting a statutory floor price per gram of alcohol; access and availability of alcohol, including of course structural separation in retail units where alcohol is sold; and advertising and sponsorship.  As part of the process of developing these proposals, my Department is in continuing discussions with various Departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality.  Discussions with the latter have been based on the implementation of the recommendations of the National Substance Misuse Strategy report, in so far as they apply to that Department; and in particular to the issue of the structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets.  In the meantime, work by officials in my Department on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation governing, among others, minimum unit pricing and labelling of alcohol, is continuing.  For example, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, a health impact assessment is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  Scotland commissioned the same sort of assessment before it drafted its legislation on minimum unit pricing.  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.</p></reply>

First, the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  This will be capped at three years, or 22.5%, in the case of the principal private residence.  This change will apply to new and existing nursing home residents.  However, for existing residents, it should be noted that, in the case of the principal private residence, the higher percentage will only apply for the time remaining of the three-year cap.  In the case of all other assets, it will apply for as long as the person remains in receipt of financial support under the scheme.  Second, the entitlement for State support to be backdated to 27 October 2009 for people who were in nursing home care prior to the scheme commencing will be abolished.  It is important to note that the legislation underpinning the scheme must be amended before these measures can be implemented.  Therefore, an effective date will be announced in 2013.  Finally, the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will proceed as planned.  A considerable amount of preparatory work for the review has already been completed.  It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed in 2013.</p></reply>

The Diabetes Nurse Specialist posts will support the phased roll-out of the national chronic disease management programme for diabetes which is expected to commence shortly.  The HSE recently held interviews for the Diabetes Nurse Specialist posts.  It is expected that these posts will be filled early in 2013.

The aim is to ensure that anyone with a concern about their breast implants will have the option of discussing those matters in the first instance with their general practitioner or surgeon.  If the outcome of this discussion between the patient and their doctor is that an individual requires further follow up and treatment (up to and including removal of the implants) then this will be facilitated through public hospitals.

The NTPF is currently finalising the details of its funding for 2013 with my Department before proceeding.</p><p>  In relation to the reference to an increased threat of cancer and serious health problems for those recipients of PIP implants, the scientific evidence from Europe and internationally has consistently found no increased risk of cancer or health risks for women with PIP implants and the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) remain consistent in this regard.

The new Nutley Wing at the hospital, built at a cost of just under &euro;29m and opened this summer, is designed to provide a state of the art clinical building which includes up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.  In the new unit 20 beds are set aside for patients with cystic fibrosis.  Each bed is in a separate room with its own toilet and washing facilities. The 20 beds include 4 complete isolation rooms.  The unit also provides a dedicated CF Day Unit, containing offices, treatment rooms, together with 10 single day treatment rooms, each with en-suite sanitary facilities for treating patients with cystic fibrosis.</p><p>  Under a protocol for the treatment of CF patients at SVUH, signed off in July 2012 with the hospital, the HSE, Department of Health and CFA, up to 34 isolation beds will be available in the new wing.and the 10-bed day unit will be used effectively to help ensure that patients are treated in the optimum setting. Except in certain circumstances, the additional 14 single inpatient rooms when required will be located in the Nutley Wing and these rooms will be grouped together as far as possible. 1-2 inpatient rooms in the Nutley Wing will be kept available at all times for emergency admissions. In circumstances where the emergency admission rooms have already been utilised and all the other inpatient rooms in the Nutley Wing are occupied, patients with CF will be accommodated elsewhere  in clinically appropriate single rooms until such time as a room becomes available in the Nutley Wing and then the patient will be transferred there as a priority.</p><p>  The position with regard to the facilities in St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin for patients with Cystic Fibrosis is being continuously monitored and the hospital, the HSE and the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland continue to engage constructively to ensure that the needs of patients with Cystic Fibrosis who are acutely ill and require admission to the hospital are met. </p></reply>

The NYCI, as Irish Aid&rsquo;s key partner in the youth sector, was invited to submit a concept note for a programme of development education in the youth sector. The concept note was appraised against Irish Aid's standard programme appraisal criteria, but was found to lack clarity on what was to be achieved by the proposed multi-annual programme and on the NYCI&rsquo;s core competency in this regard.

An important element of the programme, funded under Vote 27 of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is support for development education in Ireland.  Irish Aid&rsquo;s development education budget provides funding for the activities of education institutions and Non-Governmental Organisations to build a stronger understanding of global development issues and the role of the Ireland&rsquo;s development programme. It aims to promote a stronger sense of global solidarity and responsibility and to strengthen public awareness of the reality of the issues involved in our commitment to development cooperation.</p><p>  Expenditure under the Development Education budget amounted to &euro;4,639,895 in 2010 and &euro;3,236,423 in 2011.  The estimated expenditure for 2012 is just over &euro;3,209,000.  Additionally, development Non-Governmental Organisations were invited in 2012 to incorporate development education and public engagement initiatives in Ireland as part of their proposals under Irish Aid&rsquo;s new round of overseas programme funding.  This element of the programme funding will amount to some &euro;1,482,000 for 2012. Prior to the 2012 programme funding round, a smaller number of development Non-Governmental Organisations received Irish Aid funding for similar activities which amounted to some &euro;239,700 in 2010 and &euro;210,800 in 2011.  The allocation for development education budget for 2013 has yet to be finalised as part of the decisions taken in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

The European Union is working actively to support efforts to bring peace and stability to the country, and this will remain an important foreign policy priority for the EU during Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming Presidency of the European Council in the first half of 2013.</p><p>  The Democratic Republic of Congo has been ravaged by a long series of violent conflicts.  Millions of innocent civilians have been killed, injured or displaced from their homes and there have been systematic abuses of human rights, extremely high levels of sexual violence, and widespread recruitment and use of child soldiers.  The latest upsurge in violence, since the early summer, has been driven by the so-called M23 group which has been responsible for a campaign of violence which has caused many deaths and significant displacement and trauma.  The EU has repeatedly called on the M23 to end its campaign of violence and we have also condemned and called for an end to external support for the group.</p><p>  The EU is playing a constructive and significant role in ongoing efforts to deal with the crisis.  Developments in the DRC are regularly discussed by EU Foreign Ministers.  We adopted strong formal Conclusions on the situation in the DRC at the Foreign Affairs Council in November and again more recently on 10 December.  We are supporting the African Union and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region which are taking the lead on efforts to end the conflict in the eastern DRC.  The EU is also providing a programme of support for the DRC authorities aimed at strengthening their capacities to promote better governance and the rule of law. This programme focuses on institutional reform and democracy, physical infrastructure and security sector reform, including within the Congolese Armed Forces. </p><p>  Historically, Ireland has played its part in working for peace and justice in the DRC.  In recent years, we have focused in particular on providing support for the humanitarian response to the conflict.  So far this year, Ireland has provided some &euro;8.23 million in humanitarian support, including &euro;3.5 million allocated this month to the Common Humanitarian Fund, a UN-administered fund which is allocated to projects by the resident UN Humanitarian Coordinator in the DRC.  In addition, Irish Aid has also provided funds to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for its work to coordinate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across the country. Further funding has been made available to NGO partners such as Concern, Christian Aid and Oxfam.  Earlier this month, these three NGOs also benefitted from an emergency airlift of humanitarian supplies in response to the serious situation in North Kivu in the eastern DRC, with 18,000 blankets, 600 tarpaulins and 500 tents dispatched from Irish Aid&rsquo;s pre-positioned stocks in Dubai to help those displaced by the recent fighting. </p><p>  A very strong focus of our concern and attention in the DRC is, and will remain, on the human rights situation.  The DRC is a country which has commanded significant attention from the UN Human Rights Council and from the Human Rights Commission which preceded the establishment of the Council.  As well as regular reviews of the overall country situation, there has been a very specific focus on mapping human rights violations during conflict and on the phenomenon of sexual violence and its impact on victims.

Since the uprising in Syria began in March 2011 an estimated 40,000 people have been killed in the violence. Over 2.5 million people inside Syria are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, with 1.2 million people displaced inside the country. The number of registered refugees from Syria in the region has now passed half a million. This has placed enormous pressure on Syria&rsquo;s neighbours, who have made commendable efforts to host the refugee population and respond proactively and generously to their needs.</p><p>  Ireland too has responded swiftly to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and in neighbouring countries. As early as March 2012 we provided &euro;500,000 in emergency funding for the ICRC, UNHCR and the World Food Programme. In August I visited Jordan and witnessed firsthand the huge strain that the refugee population is placing on the host countries, both in relation to the refugee camps and also the host communities. Since then Ireland has provided additional support of &euro;1,750,000 to UN agencies and NGO partners who are providing life saving medical assistance to Syrians both in Syria and neighbouring countries. Irish assistance also included supplies of non-food items from our stocks in Dubai. A contribution of &euro;200,000 to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees caught up in the conflict brings Ireland&rsquo;s total response to the crisis to &euro;2,450,000.</p><p>  Ireland also understands that while this is a humanitarian crisis, it is driven by politics and will only be solved with a political solution. From the beginning, Ireland has recognised this, striving to respond to the humanitarian needs of the populations affected by the violence whilst working simultaneously for a sustainable political solution, based on accommodating the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Syrian people. Ireland has worked for a unified international response and has particularly encouraged the members of the UN Security Council to live up to its responsibilities and show leadership in relation to the crisis, primarily through adoption of a new, strong Security Council Resolution. </p><p>We continue to strongly support the efforts of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to promote a political settlement. An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, T.D. was very pleased to meet with Mr. Brahimi during the recent OSCE ministerial meeting in Dublin where he also met with Secretary of State Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov. Ireland has also participated actively within the framework of the Friends of Syria Group, which includes my own attendance at the most recent meeting of the group last week in Marrakesh.  </p><p>  Ireland has provided significant support to those in need as a result of this crisis. Into the future we will continue to monitor the situation so that we can assess when we may be able to further contribute, within our means, to the humanitarian needs within the region. </p></reply>

Tax stamps are examined using a range of hand held devices that are available to all Revenue enforcement staff.  The Revenue Commissioners advise that in 2009 the technical specification for tax stamps was significantly upgraded to make it more difficult for the stamps to be counterfeited. The stamp was further enhanced in 2011.  The Revenue Commissioners further advise that this latest version has proven to be extremely robust in that regard.    The Revenue Commissioners are constantly exploring ways to improve their methods of detecting illicit cigarettes.  They are aware of the proposal to develop a smart phone application referred to by the Deputy and understand that this would operate by reading the bar-coding affixed to packaging by cigarette manufacturers.  One of the key elements of any security feature on cigarette packaging is that it must be extremely difficult to copy.  The Commissioners advise that it is not fully clear to them that bar coding would satisfy this particular requirement.  Revenue will continue to examine any additional potential opportunities that bar coding and the use of phone apps for that purpose may offer but at present they have no plans to get involved in the development of an app which would be of marginal value in relation to their overall security requirements. </p></reply>

NAMA advises that the Deputy is most likely referring to the Independent Business Review (IBR) that was carried out in respect of all debtor business plans from 2010.  NAMA advises that Deloitte was one of a number of firms appointed, following a competitive public procurement tender process, to its IBR panel and that in June 2010 Deloitte was selected from this panel to independently review the Treasury Holdings business plan.  NAMA advises that Deloitte completed this work in October 2010.  NAMA advises that, as with any other IBR firm, it was a matter for Deloitte to determine where they sourced the property expertise required to complete the assignment. Typically, the input required from property specialists in IBR assignments was to comment on the debtor&rsquo;s asset strategies as submitted in the draft business plan and to put forward their own expert views on asset strategy and the optimal timing of any proposed sales. NAMA is satisfied that Deloitte had sufficient property expertise available to them to complete this assignment in Ireland and overseas and understands that they engaged separate property advisors for each country.  Any property expertise employed by Deloitte involved a contractual arrangement between them and the two separate property advisory firms concerned and NAMA was not a party to such contracts. The fee payable by Deloitte to secure such expertise was a matter between them and the firms concerned.</p></reply>

The key issue, however, is that NAMA takes steps to ensure conflicts of interest do not occur. Under Section 42 of the NAMA Act, before he or she is assigned to NAMA, each officer is required to provide a statement of his or her interests, assets and liabilities to the Chief Executive Officer of NAMA and the Chief Executive of NTMA. Furthermore, a key item for any NAMA evaluation group for procurement of services is a declaration by each member that they have no conflict of interest.  NAMA advises me that this enables the Agency to ensure that potential conflicts of interest in the management of the loan portfolios are managed effectively; and that staff do not participate in decisions which may involve the allocation of work to companies for which they worked previously.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that NAMA have procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest.</p></reply>

Places are allocated to Vocational Education Committees (VECs), Community and Comprehensive and Voluntary Secondary schools on an annual basis following an application process and VECs are responsible for the further allocation of those places to schools and colleges under their remit.  City of Cork VEC has an allocation of some 4,020 Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) places and manages the PLC centres referred to by the Deputies.</p><p>  As a result of the change in the pupil teacher ratio (PTR) the VEC's allocation of PLC teaching posts will be reduced from 236 to 212, a reduction of 24.  These changes will not take effect until September 2013 and the VEC has until then to plan for the reduced teaching allocation for PLC centres under its remit.  While it would have been preferable not to have to make any changes, by bringing the PLC PTR into line with that of free second level schools the Government has succeeded in protecting the class sizes in primary and free second-level schools for the coming year, ensuring that our limited resources are rightly focussed on the children in our education system.  It will result in an estimated saving of &euro;12 million in a full year and &euro;4 million in 2013.  There will be a reduction of some 200 PLC teaching posts as a result of this change and it may result in a reduction in the range of subjects available to students.  It is now up to the CEOs of each VEC to look at the resources available to them and to work with their Principals and staff to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.</p></reply>

This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The outcome of this is a significant increase in the number of new claims processed in recent months where claims processed have substantially exceeded claim intake.  To achieve this improvement, significant additional temporary resources have been allocated to the backlog elimination effort and the situation continues to be managed and monitored to ensure that the backlog is eliminated in the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

The total weekly SWA expenditure in respect of these payments is approximately &euro;4.3 million.  The weekly SWA expenditure in respect of claims made within a three week period accounts for approximately &euro;0.5 million. </p><p>  Payments issued under the SWA scheme are recouped from the primary social welfare scheme on award. Therefore, the issue of savings does not arise in these circumstances.  Given the very nature of the SWA scheme, which is the safety net within the social welfare system, it is unlikely that these customers would not have an entitlement to another social welfare scheme if refused under their original application or on appeal.  For example a customer who may not satisfy the conditions for an unemployment support may have an entitlement to an illness type payment.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to ensure that social welfare claims are processed in the shortest possible timeframes.  A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to the Department on 1st October 2011 is to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer. The process of integration is on-going and progress has already been made with a unified service, Intreo, now in the process of being delivered in four offices.  Significant efforts are also being made in the processing of illness related schemes with additional temporary staff having being assigned to the area, the recent completion of a major service delivery modernisation project and an in-depth business process improvement project having recently commenced with the aim of eliminating backlogs and improving customer service.  Significant resources and efforts have also been put into reducing volumes and improving processing times for appellants to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  All of these measures combined will reduce the requirement for recourse to SWA.</p></reply>

In their report , the Alignment Steering Group recognised the key strengths of local development companies, in areas such as service planning and delivery. </p><p>  Programme administration funding will continue to be available to local development companies in respect of their continued involvement in such work. The exact arrangements in this regard are significantly dependant on the scale of future programmes, including decisions yet to be taken at EU level. </p><p>Alignment will see local development and local government working in partnership with each other, and their communities. The recommendations of the Alignment Steering Group highlight the need to improve efficiency across the local and community development sector, for example through shared service arrangements between local development companies and with local authorities. The alignment process should facilitate the best use of the resources, experience and expertise available at local level to deliver better services in the most cost effective and efficient way possible. These and other new arrangements should place local development structures on a more sustainable footing, and they will be the focus of the implementation arrangements that my Department is putting in place for these reforms. In particular, the key stakeholders have been invited to participate on an alignment implementation group to assist and advise on the implementation of the alignment recommendations and I look forward to progress in a spirit of co-operation, trust and respect between the sectors.   </p></reply>

While the moratorium continues to apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the question of when recruitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should resume will be kept under continuing review in the context of retirements and the availability of resources.  I will remain in dialogue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on this, but what is vital now is that the still significant resources of the Force are used with maximum efficiency and to the greatest effect.  That is why the reforms being introduced by the Garda Commissioner, such as new rosters and the rationalisation of the Garda station and District networks, are essential.  </p></reply>

In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the specific financial information he has sought is not readily available and I understand that the provision of such information would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources which are required for other purposes.</p><p>  However, I have also been advised by the Garda authorities that the annual financial saving estimated to arise in respect of the closure of the stations referred to by the Deputy is Euro 4,000 per station.  To a large extent these estimates relate to heating and lighting costs and they do not take account of specific repair bills, which will vary from premises to premises. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the closure of the stations has been proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plan for 2013 and I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  In addition, the Commissioner has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country. </p><p>  Capital expenditure in respect of Garda accommodation is provided from the Vote of the Office for Public Works and, accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the information the Deputy has sought under this heading.</p></reply>

A person found guilty of this offence is liable to life imprisonment.</p><p>  In June of this year, I published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution.  The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process.  On its publication, I referred the discussion document to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The joint committee is conducting the consultation process and will report back to me when it has completed its work.  </p><p>  In addition, my Department hosted a conference on 13 October to discuss the consultation paper.</p><p>  The report of the joint committee and the views expressed at the October conference will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course. </p><p>  For further background, I am appending the text of my statement of 22 June last when publishing the discussion document.</p><p>  Shatter Announces Publication of Discussion Document on the Future Direction of Legislation on Prostitution</p><p>  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence today published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution. Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation.  Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:</p><p>  &quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland.  Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.</p><p>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution.  While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement.  It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;   </p><p>  The Minister added that:  </p><p>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole.  It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course.  Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so.  It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.</p><p>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.   </p><p>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate.  I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received.  I expect it is likely that the Committee&rsquo;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.   </p><p>  I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;   </p><p>  The discussion document will be made available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.justice.ie   </p><p>  This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection. The arguments contained in the document are not exhaustive and the questions posed are not intended to limit in any way the range of questions readers might want to consider.</p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services, and a number of additional services, including the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  </p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July of this year.  I share with the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. It is my intention that the Agency will be as broadly based as possible and that it should include those services that might, in the first instance, help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage, and, that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  I can assure both the Deputy and the Prevention and Early Intervention Network (PEIN) that the work of the new Agency will include a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that very considerable progress has already been achieved in the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services. I am confident that the establishment of the Agency will bring a dedicated focus to child protection, family support and other key children&rsquo;s services for the first time in the history of the State and will in time contribute to the transformation of what are essential services for families and communities.</p></reply>

The allocations are distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies/bodies that hold funding administration status. These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils. </p><p>  My Department is examining the scope for streamlining the tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding. From January 2013, it is proposed to transfer the administration of the allocated funding  involving six national organisations to the City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB). These six national bodies are currently responsible for administering funding to some 30 youth projects on behalf of my Department. </p><p>  CDYSB is a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC.  The CDYSB, on behalf of CDVEC, has for several years, undertaken the administration of some 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.   The initiative is subject to the successful completion of a service level agreement between my Department and the CDVEC and discussions are ongoing with CDYSB at present.  </p><p>  The proposed revised administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned. Subject to a successful transition to the new system it is proposed that consideration will be given to further streamlining financial processing arrangements in 2014.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves. </p><p>Every effort is being made my Department to ensure that, in the administration of the funding allocations in the present challenging budgetary situation, the focus is maintained on the provision of the front line services for young people. The VECs have a statutory role in the provision of youth services and further legislative provision to continue this important function is contained in the Education and Training Boards Bill, 2012. Indeed it would be the hope of the Department that, in reducing the administrative burden in relation to the funding of projects, the role of youth officers, in supporting youth projects in the delivery of a quality youth service to young people, would be strengthened. The VECs will continue to receive funding from the Department in respect of this valued role including for the costs of the youth officers employed by them.   </p><p>  My Department will communicate further and hold discussions about the proposals for change with the VECs and other organisations that administer funding on its behalf during the course of 2013.   Officials from my Department are in ongoing discussions with the Irish Vocational Educational Association.</p></reply>

The basis of the complaint (which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner) was that the NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. During 2010, a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the HSE, my Department and Temple Street Hospital. A policy was agreed in conjunction with the DPC to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme.</p><p>  In accordance with the policy, from July 1st 2011, the blood portion of the Newborn Screening Card (NSC) will be retained for 10 years and disposed of during the child&rsquo;s 11th year (for the purpose of confirming an initial diagnosis should this be deemed necessary). Parents/guardians are provided with specific information on the retention of the NSC&rsquo;s with regard to their use and written consent is sought in this regard. The changes to the NNBSP since 1st July 2011 bring about compliance with both national and EU data protection legislation, uphold ethical principles and meet ethical obligations with regard to consent, privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>  The agreed policy also provided for the disposal of archived NSCs older than ten years. Following receipt of representations concerning the proposed destruction of archived Newborn Screening Cards, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision. The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January 2012. My Department is liaising with the HSE concerning their publication of the report.</p></reply>

Isolation precautions are used to reduce transmission of micro-organisms in healthcare and residential settings.  These measures are designed to protect patients/residents, staff and visitors from contact with infectious agents.   There are two categories of isolation precautions: standard precautions and transmission-based precautions.</p><p>   Standard precautions are a set of basic infection prevention practices intended to prevent transmission of infectious diseases from one person to another.  Because we do not always know if a person has an infectious disease, standard precautions are applied to every person every time to assure that transmission of disease does not occur. These precautions were formerly known as &quot;universal precautions.&quot; Standard precautions include:</p><p>- Hand hygiene </p><p>- Personal protective equipment</p><p>- Environmental and equipment cleaning &amp; disinfection</p><p>- Safe injection practices</p><p>  There are three types of transmission-based precautions;</p><p>- Contact precautions (for diseases spread by direct or indirect contact)</p><p>- Droplet precautions (for diseases spread by large particles in the air) and </p><p>- Airborne precautions (for diseases spread by small particles in the air). </p><p>  Each type of precautions has some unique prevention steps that should be taken, but all have standard precautions as their foundation. Each hospital should have mechanisms in place to detect clusters/outbreaks of infections in a timely manner and notify to public health.  The outbreak control team then agrees the appropriate preventative measures that need to be implemented which may include visitor restrictions as appropriate.</p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.</p><p>  The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For adults, the target waiting time is that no-one should be waiting more than nine months for inpatient and day case treatments. By 13 December last, the number of adults waiting more than 9 months was just 434 compared with 3,706 patients waiting longer than nine months at the end of December 2011.  For children, the target is that by the end of 2012 no child should be waiting for inpatient or daycase treatment for more than 20 weeks. Again, huge progress has been made towards this target &ndash; on 13 December, there were just 234 children waiting longer than 20 weeks compared with 1,759 at the end of December 2011. </p><p>  Improving access to outpatient services is the next priority for the Government and for the SDU Scheduled Care Team.  Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time, clear and comprehensive data on this problem is being reported.  In the first instance, the data now being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.

The method and timescale for the delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors; it is a dynamic process constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  Work is underway on the Executive's multi-annual Capital Plan 2013-2017 and consideration of projects for inclusion in this Plan is an evolving process.

The current GMS contract stipulates that General Practitioners &quot;shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the HSE, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a GP and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree which GPs cannot reasonably be expected to possess&quot;</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE are currently examining the changes that need to be made to the GMS contract to facilitate the introduction of Universal Primary Care.</p><p>The Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 came into effect on 12th March 2012.  The Act provides for the elimination of restrictions on GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the GMS Scheme by opening up access to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs.  By 30th November 2012, 97 GPs had been granted a GMS contract by the HSE under the provisions of the Act.  33 further applications are currently being processed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-19a.550.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121900079#WRQ01600"><p>The Deputy has raised a number of issues with regard to hospitals. </p><p>  In relation to the collection of waiting time data, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) collects information on (a) hospital in-patients and day case waiting times and (b) outpatient waiting times.  In relation to in-patient and daycases, information on the median (average) waiting time in each hospital for the top surgical procedures on the waiting list is published on the NTPF website.  In regard to outpatients, the numbers of patients waiting for a first appointment at a consultant-led clinic, by hospital, by time band are published and available on the NTPF website and through the HSE Performance Reports.  HIQA's Tallaght Hospital Investigation Report 2012 recommended the benchmarking and publication of outpatient department (OPD) appointment wait times across all hospitals at a national, regional, local and consultant level. National, regional and local wait times are now available and I am advised by the NTPF that it is the intention to publish consultant level waiting time during the course of 2013/14.  In relation to the efficiency of hospitals, the HSE currently publishes two separate monthly reports addressing the efficiency of all hospitals.  The Performance Report is a monthly report published on the HSE website and it details performance against the HSE Service Plan and contains some hospital level information.  HealthStat is a comprehensive databank of performance information which provides detailed monthly results from hospitals and from Local Health Offices responsible for providing health and social care services in the community.  The results are also published on the HSE website.</p><p>  In 2013, HealthStat will be replaced by CompStat, which is a performance management and reporting system which will operate on a monthly cycle.  It is built around a balanced accountability framework of Quality, Access and Resources wherein each HSE Region will be the locus of control.  It supports the migration towards autonomous hospital groups and incorporates a score-card performance report on a suite of relevant metrics.  CompStat will focus on Acute Hospitals metrics from an In-patient, Out-patient and Day-case perspective and on Community metrics from a Local Health Office representative of all care groups perspective.  CompStat will deliver higher quality efficiency measurements for all hospitals and community services.</p><p>  The Programme for Government commits to introducing a prospective-based &quot;Money Follows the Patient&quot; (MFTP) funding system to replace the current block grant allocation system.  Under MFTP, hospitals will be encouraged to provide services more efficiently and will be paid on a fair and transparent basis for the needs they address, the quantity and quality of the services they provide and the outcomes they deliver. They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance. A Hospital Financing Subgroup, established under the auspices of the Universal Health Insurance Implementation Group, has prepared draft policy and implementation proposals, and these are currently being considered by the Minister.</p><p>  With regard to catchment areas, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.</p></reply>

Firstly, the applicant did not sign the section of the application form certifying, among other things, that the information supplied was correct and that the club would not deny anybody access to the facilities.  Secondly, the evidence of title to the property where the proposed facility was to be located did not state that the applicant's lease is registered in the Property Registration Authority or is pending registration.
