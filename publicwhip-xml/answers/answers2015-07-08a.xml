    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-08a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800072#WRA00500"><p>I am aware that the lack of access to affordable, quality childcare can be a significant barrier to many low-income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities.  To address this issue, my Department currently invests over &euro;260 million each year to support a number of childcare programmes.  These include: the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education  programme which benefits approximately 67,000 children each year and reduces the childcare costs for parents by as much as &euro;2,774 for each qualifying child; and the Community Childcare Subvention programme, which provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  from this programme each year and, in the case of full day care, parents can have their childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week.   </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the: Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses; Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and  After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   </p>  <p>  The high level of funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children.  The Group will submit its report to me shortly and I intend to bring it to Government for discussion in the context of the Estimates process for Budget 2016.</p></reply>

The purpose of the National Youth Strategy is to enable all young people aged 10 to 24 to realise their maximum potential with regard to the five national outcomes  in Better Outcomes, Brighter Future. It will be a universal strategy for all young people. It will have a particular focus on the needs of  young people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing the  poorest outcomes. </p>  <p>The Strategy is based on an understanding of youth as a distinctive period of development between childhood and adulthood. It takes account of the social and economic factors that influence young people during this period, and the important roles that parents, families, friends, other adults and communities play in their lives. Its development is informed by national and European policy developments and the results of a national consultation   process. </p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy identifies key objectives to be achieved for young people so that they may be active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and be connected and contributing to their world.   It sets out priority actions to be delivered by stakeholders such as Government departments, state agencies and by the NGO sector over 2015 to 2017.  </p>  <p>My Department will lead and support the implementation of the new Strategy  and progress will be monitored through the structures put in place under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures  .  I am pleased to say that  the National Youth Strategy is almost complete and I intend to bring it to Government in the next few weeks. I will then publish it at an early date.</p></reply>

It consists of committed funding for an area-based approach to improve outcomes for children and thereby reduce child poverty. The programme builds on and continues the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme 2007 - 2013 which was co-funded by the my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies.  </p>  <p>  The ABC Programme involves joint investment of  my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies of &euro;29.7m in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in disadvantaged areas. It aims to break the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The ABC Programme is time-bound and the co-funding arrangement between Government and The Atlantic Philanthropies is in place until 2017.  </p>  <p>  A key purpose of the ABC Programme is to identify the learning in and across the ABC sites and to transfer this learning into existing and established services. Adopting such a systems focus, rather than merely a site or geographic specific focus, is the intention so that we can ensure a greater reach and sustained impact in services across the country.  What I want to ensure is that, rather than creating parallel provision, the learning from this programme informs the ongoing reform of established services and supports for children and young people.  Mainstreaming the learning in this way will bring improvements, not only in specific areas, but across the wider system, thereby addressing all areas of disadvantage.  A Task Group has been established to explore how best to mainstream the learning where programmes  and activities have proven more effective than existing provision.</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme is currently being evaluated under the guidance of an Expert Advisory Group. The evaluation adopts a shared measurement framework across all ABC programme sites. The evaluation will consider the implementation and cost of programmes, and crucially how the outcomes for children and families in Area Based Childhood areas have changed during the course of the programme. </p>  <p>  This evaluation will be crucial in indicating the impact of the ABC Programme, and along with the work of the Task Group will be key in informing considerations regarding the mainstreaming of the learning from this programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-08a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800072#WRA01300"><p>Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of sexual violence and domestic violence services, in consultation with service providers. The purpose was to identify strategic priorities and set out a roadmap for the delivery of these services. Tusla is seeking through this process to address any identified gaps in services, to avoid duplication and to support effective delivery of frontline services nationally. Tusla considers that there is scope for a more co-ordinated and more equitable provision of these services across the country. </p>  <p>  One of the concerns identified by Tusla relates to the completeness and availability of data to plan and deliver services. In addition to this, there was some duplication and overlap in the provision of domestic and sexual violence awareness training. Tusla&rsquo;s aim is to put these services on a more sustainable footing. </p>  <p>  For the first time domestic and sexual violence services are being developed as a specialist national service with a single line of accountability so as to enable better outcomes for both children and adults who are survivors of sexual violence. A roadmap for the future of service delivery has been approved by Tusla&rsquo;s Board.  </p>  <p>  The funding provided to RCNI by Tusla was to develop and maintain a database of information recorded by workers in Rape Crisis Centres. Tusla had concerns that this database did not capture information from all 16 Rape Crisis Centres as only 11 centres are affiliated with the Network. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected, which is essential to support the delivery of high quality services across both the domestic violence and sexual violence services sector.</p>  <p>  Consequently, Tusla has taken the decision to put in place a comprehensive data system that best meets the current and future data needs of a developing service.  In order to plan properly for the future, Tusla needs timely access to complete and reliable information. </p>  <p>  As part of revised governance arrangements, funded sexual violence services will provide information directly to Tusla, creating, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset on all such services funded by the Agency. This information and evidence is critically important as Tusla continues to reform services to ensure the best possible response is provided to survivors of sexual violence.</p>  <p>  With regard to Women's Aid, Tusla has allocated funding of &euro;600,000 to this organisation in 2015, to maintain current frontline service provision, including the development of the national domestic violence helpline.  Women&rsquo;s Aid also receives funding from a number of Government sources for the services it provides, including &euro;158,000 over a two year period from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government; and &euro;140,000 &ndash; an increase of &euro;60,000 in 2015 &ndash; from the Department of Justice and Equality for the awareness raising and court accompaniment services. </p>  <p>In my discussions with Tusla this year, I requested that particular priority be given to protecting frontline services, and in that context, funding for the 16 Rape Crisis Centres nationwide which provide services directly to rape survivors has been protected in 2015. Almost &euro;4.0m   in funding is dedicated to Rape Crisis Centres in 2015, with funding maintained at 2014 levels.</p>  <p>  In summary, Tusla is committed to the development of domestic, sexual and gender based violence services in line with its statutory remit to provide such services. The immediate focus is on ensuring that frontline services are protected and this is happening. Beyond that, in planning for the future provision and development of services, Tusla is committed to addressing identified gaps in service provision, eliminating duplication where it exists and ensuring the provision of a more equitable service. The availability of comprehensive national data will support Tusla in this work.</p></reply>

This funding, which is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, supports more than 100,000 children each year.</p>  <p>  The most significant of these programmes is the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, which represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;175 million and  enables almost 67,000 children each year to benefit from free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50, with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications.  Parents who qualify for support under this programme can have their annual childcare costs reduced by as much as &euro;2,774 for each qualifying child. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  from this programme each year. In the case of full day care, parents can have their weekly childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week.   </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the: Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses; Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   </p>  <p>  The high level of funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children.  The Group will submit its report to Government shortly.</p></reply>

The service now incurs an annual spend of over &euro;16 million, and needs to be grounded as a consistent, accountable and sustainable national service. My Department is currently preparing policy proposals to achieve this objective.</p><p>A &lsquo;root-and-branch&rsquo; reform is envisaged. Work on the policy proposals is being informed by a number of considerations and sources of information, including work done by the former Children Acts Advisory Board. The objective is to put in place a comprehensive legislative basis for the delivery of a high quality and sustainable service, on a national basis.</p><p>The reforms must ensure the best interests of the child, the centrality of the courts and the independence of guardians <i>ad litem,</i>but must also put in place a nationally managed service that is cohesive, accountable and sustainable. In Ireland, as in other jurisdictions, the service is subject to increasing demand and finite resources. I am determined to achieve best possible use of the substantial level of funding that has already been allocated to this area.</p><p>Reflecting elements identified by the Children Acts Advisory Board, proposed statutory arrangements will aim to address such matters as guidance as to circumstances for appointment, the qualifications that will be required for appointment, a well-defined role and responsibilities for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, their legal status in proceedings, and legal representation.</p></reply>

These services aim to support people to deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their lives. Tusla is spending &euro;5.8m in 2015, on these services. </p>  <p>Tusla has also developed  Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (  ACTS) which is a national specialised clinical service providing multidisciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviours associated with complex clinical needs. </p>  <p>  Tusla works closely with other care providers including the HSE, in respect of access to primary care services, child and adolescent mental health services, disability and other services.  Tusla and the HSE have in place, both, a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins the provision of these services for children.  </p>  <p>   Responsibility for policy in relation to the treatment and support for young people with mental health problems and those requiring medical care as a result of self-harm rests with the Department of Health.  </p>  <p> As part of the implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020 (BOBF)  , the Department of Social Protection has identified child poverty as a cross-sectoral priority action for 2015. The target is to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.</p>  <p>  There are a number of other areas of focus that support this response to child poverty.  Funding of more than a quarter of a billion euro is invested annually by my Department on early childhood care and education and after-school childcare programmes.  A number of these programmes are targeted at those on the lowest incomes.  This funding supports more than 100,000 children each year. In addition, in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  This Inter-Departmental Group, which is tasked with setting out a range of options for future investment in early years and after-school childcare is currently finalising its report, which will be submitted to Government shortly. </p>  <p>  My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people and this support is provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  </p>  <p>Finally, the National Youth Strategy 2015 - 2020 which is nearing completion will have its basis in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures  and in particular its youth-specific commitments. It will be a universal strategy for all young people and will include a particular focus on the needs of  young people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing the  poorest outcomes.</p></reply>

The statutory Educational Welfare Service of the Agency has a key role to respond to instances where children are not attending school regularly or where there is a concern about a child's educational welfare. </p><p>Where a school attendance problem arises for a child, the Agency concentrates on finding solutions working with the child, their families, schools and other relevant agencies. This work of the Educational Welfare Service falls into two categories. It may involve a brief intervention designed to resolve a school attendance issue with a child before it escalates, or the provision of an intensive intervention, where problems of poor school attendance are evidence of more complex and deep rooted issues.More than 17,000<font color="#2F2F2F"> brief interventions were provided to children in 2013, while more than 2,400 children </font>received an intensive intervention. </p><p>The School Completion Programme and  the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, under  the Department of Education and Skill's 'Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS) action plan, are core elements of the Agency's integrated approach to promote school attendance and prevent early school leaving.There are 144 local school completion projects throughout the country operating in 470 primary and 224 post primary schools. Under the Programme, local management committees prepare annual school retention plans, in which they identify the target cohort of children who may be at risk of poor school attendance and the range of supports to be provided to meet their needs. The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) is currently reviewing the School Completion Programme. The report, due shortly, will inform the future development of the programme, to prevent early school leaving and secure good educational outcomes for at risk children. </p><p>Tusla has advised that guidelines for schools on the preparation of school attendance strategies in line with Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, have recently been completed.  The guidelines will provide advice to schools about their responsibilities to encourage regular school attendance and the practical supports which can be implemented at school level to enable children to maximise their attendance and participation in education. Tusla anticipates that the new guidelines will be disseminated to schools at the start of the 2015/ 2016 school year.</p></reply>

The draft report acknowledges that its conclusions remained a matter of conjecture until such time as a more forensic examination of the home&rsquo;s records could be undertaken by the HSE. </p><p>As the issues raised in this appendix regarding adoption were outside the direct remit of the McAleese Committee, the HSE advised that these wider concerns would be examined separately by the HSE.

The programme builds on and continues the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme 2007 - 2013 which was co-funded by the my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies.  </p>  <p>  The Area Based Childhood ABC Programme involves joint investment of my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies of &euro;29.7m in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in disadvantaged areas. It aims to break the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The ABC Programme is time-bound and the co-funding arrangement between Government and The Atlantic Philanthropies is in place until 2017.  </p>  <p>  A key purpose of the ABC Programme is to identify the learning in and across the ABC sites and to transfer this learning into existing and established services. Adopting such a systems focus, rather than merely a site or geographic specific focus, is the intention so that we can ensure a greater reach and sustained impact in services across the country.  What I want to ensure is that, rather than creating parallel provision, the learning from this programme informs the ongoing reform of established services and supports for children and young people.  Mainstreaming the learning in this way will bring improvements, not only in specific areas, but across the wider system, thereby addressing all areas of disadvantage.  A Task Group has been established to explore how best to mainstream the learning where programmes  and activities have proven more effective than existing provision.</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme is currently being evaluated under the guidance of an Expert Advisory Group. The evaluation adopts a shared measurement framework across all ABC programme sites. The evaluation will consider the implementation and cost of programmes, and crucially how the outcomes for children and families in Area Based Childhood areas have changed during the course of the programme. </p>  <p>  This evaluation will be crucial in indicating the impact of the ABC Programme, and along with the work of the Task Group will be key in informing considerations regarding the mainstreaming of the learning from this programme.</p></reply>

My Department is aware that many are already used for pre and after-school activities.</p>  <p>  The issue of school ownership impacts on the extent to which the State can influence how primary schools use any additional facilities or space they may have.   The vast majority of primary school buildings in the country are in private ownership. Of the 3,278 primary schools in 2014, only 190 (6%) are in the ownership of the Minister for Education and Skills. The remaining 94% of primary schools are in private ownership.   The State has no authority to compel Patrons who are the owners of school sites to accommodate childcare services on their own property.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Minister for Education and Skills is, however, supportive of coherent measures that facilitate greater community use of schools while respecting the core role of schools. In relation to use of existing school premises, my colleague is of the view that, in the first instance the core role of a school in delivering  education to its student body has to be paramount and any additional activities have to adhere to that core role.   There are also a number of practical issues, such as lease terms, insurance, etc., that need to be properly examined for schools considering additional activities on their premises.</p>  <p>  In relation to the process of selecting a childcare provider to provide a childcare service in the primary school setting, I am aware that some existing pre and after-school providers have additional capacity and would be interested in tendering for such services if schools decided to do so.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these issues, the Inter-Departmental Group, which I have established to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare, has considered the use of the school infrastructure for future delivery of childcare, particularly for after-school and out-of-school care.

This may involve providing a social work service up to and including receiving a child into care.  A child may be received into care under a voluntary basis or by order of the Courts.  The development of the statutory care plan will set out what is in the best interests of the child. When the desired outcome is for the reunification of the child with its parents or guardians, work will take place to try to achieve this aim.  This can only happen if it is safe to do so. </p><p>The statutory framework also includes regulations, which cover different aspects of the overall service including fostering and residential care.  The regulations set out the minimum requirements in delivering these services. In relation to children in care, the regulations set out requirements for the allocation of social workers, completion and review of care plans and the frequency of visits by social workers to the child in their placement.  In addition to the regulatory framework, there is a strong and independent inspection regime under the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Tusla publishes performance statistics, including the number of children in care with an allocated social worker and a care plan on a regular basis on its website.  My Department engages with Tusla regularly on its performance and budget to ensure that it is meeting its overall objectives.  </p><p>Intrinsic to the policies and procedures for children in care is that access and contact is facilitated between the child, parents/guardians and siblings, unless there is a substantive reason not to do so or it would cause a child undue distress.  It is interesting to note that over recent years there is a significant number of children coming into care for less than a year. According to Tusla figures, 1,151 children spent less than one year in State care in 2012.  Also, children in care are a minority of the total number of open cases being managed by Tusla.  This indicates that coming to the attention of Tusla does not automatically require entering into care and that when a child does have to be taken into care there is a good chance of being in care for less than a year.  It can also be noted that Ireland has a high rate of children in care placed in a family setting, with 93% of children in general or relative foster care at the end of April 2015.</p><p>Full engagement takes place with the child and their family with a view to planning the child&rsquo;s return home.  A significant amount of work takes place between social workers and parents/guardians to create a situation where a child can return home with a focus on their welfare and safety.  As well as working with the child, the social work service may involve referrals for parent(s) or guardians to supports that will enable the child to return home, including relationship counselling, addiction or mental health services.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Skills and other relevant Government departments to achieve these aims.</p>  <p>  Under the remit of my Department, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency  has a statutory function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency is a statutory service supporting regular school attendance for all school age children and young people.

The aim is to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of young people who are risk of  early school leaving and educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle. The programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.

All childcare programmes supported by my Department currently provide funding directly to childcare providers, either in the form of capitation or subvention payments. This kind of funding mechanism provides the leverage to progressively build the quality of childcare provision, while at the same time making childcare more affordable. </p>  <p>  To deliver the free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating services. To incentivise higher quality, a higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is paid per eligible child to services with more highly qualified staff. Parents who qualify for support under this programme can have their annual childcare costs reduced by as much as &euro;2,774 for each qualifying child. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families, and in the case of full day care, parents can have their weekly childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week for each qualifying child.   </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the: 1. Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses;  2. Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and 3. After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   For these three Programmes, the maximum contribution a parent makes to the cost of childcare is capped at &euro;15 per week for part-time and after-school care and &euro;25 per week in the case of full-day care. </p>  <p>  The question of tax allowances for working parents was considered prior to the introduction of these childcare programmes.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of tax relief for childcare.  For example, the introduction of tax credits would not help to support quality improvements within the early years sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability. There is also concern that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents. </p>  <p>  Options for future  investment in childcare, including direct funding to services and tax relief for parents, are currently being considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established in February this year. This Inter-Departmental Group, which is tasked with setting out a range of options for current and future investment, will consider options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision and support the sustainability of the early years sector. </p>  <p>  The work of the Group is framed by research and evidence of best practice (both national and international) and by existing policy commitments, including those set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. The Group has solicited the views of key stakeholders, interested parties and the general public through a number of consultative processes. It will submit a series of recommendations to Government shortly.</p></reply>

The Department of Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration.  Children living in Direct Provision are in the care of their parent(s). However, any concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in Direct Provision are reported to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency in line with Children First guidelines.  Tusla has been working closely with the Reception and Integration Agency, which has responsibility for accommodation in the direct provision system, on information sharing protocols.  Tusla also has a role in providing care and protection for any unaccompanied minors who present seeking asylum.  These children are, by definition, without parents or family in this jurisdiction and Tusla receives them into care on this basis while their applications for asylum are being processed.  </p>  <p>The Ombudsman for Children is independent in his function and is directly accountable to the Oireachtas in relation to the exercise of his functions as provided in the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. As Minister, I have certain functions and responsibilities for the Ombudsman for Children's Office under the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002. These primarily relate to governance matters, most notably the funding of the Ombudsman for Children's Office through the Vote of my Department.  Where matters are to be raised in relation to specific policies, including any need for legislative change he may wish to discuss, the Ombudsman for Children would engage with the relevant Minister directly, in this case the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This particular issue was raised by the previous Ombudsman for Children in the report &lsquo;Review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002&rsquo;  in 2012.  My Department engaged on the recommendation contained in that review with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, who considered that no legislative change was required. </p>  <p>On the 30th June 2015 the Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and supports to asylum seekers, was published. The report contains 173 recommendations pertaining to improvements to the current systems and processes.  A representative from my Department participated on this Working Group, contributing papers and hosting a subgroup of working group members with a particular interest in children's issues.  I welcome the recommendations and look forward engaging with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the recommendations that would involve my Department.   I continue to support the Minister for Justice in her drive to implement change in this area and improve the lives of those who need to avail of the protection process.</p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - economic security and opportunity.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  </p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures set out a target of lifting over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  </p>  <p>  To inform the development of a multidimensional approach to tackling child poverty, a national seminar on &lsquo;Investing in children &ndash; breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo; was held with the European Commission and attended by national stakeholders in November 2014.   My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection supporting this multidimensional approach to child poverty.</p>  <p>  As regards my own Department there are a number of areas of focus that support this response to child poverty.  My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group is focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  This Group will report to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services. </p>  <p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  The purpose of the forthcoming National Youth Strategy 2015 - 2020 is to enable all young people aged 10 to 24 to realise their maximum potential with regard to the five national outcomes in Better Outcomes, Brighter Future.    It will be a universal strategy for all young people.  It will have a particular focus on the needs of young people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes. </p>  <p>  Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the child and family agency is also responsible for the delivery of educational welfare services which involves intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach to address the child's needs and support school attendance. During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.</p>  <p>  Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes over 100 family resource centres.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The Programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support the delivery of a range of universal and targeted youth work programmes and services for young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities. </p>  <p>  The schemes include the Youth Services Grant Scheme, under which funding is provided to 30 national and major regional organisations to support their services. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2,  and the Local Drugs Task Force Projects Scheme. Other schemes administered by my Department include the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In 2015, an allocation of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department to support the provision of youth services. </p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards. The scheme is open to some 1,600 youth groups and clubs, with an estimated 89,000 club members around the country. In 2015, &euro;1.035m has been allocated to this scheme. The scheme, which is open to new entrants, is advertised locally and applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  Each year, some 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme.</p>  <p>  The question of additional investment in the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme will be considered in the context of the resources that are made available to my Department in the Estimates and Budgetary process and my Department's priorities for the future development of the services for young people, in line with the new National Youth Strategy, which will be available shortly.</p></reply>

It involves 124 locally managed projects and provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. </p>  <p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) review of the School Completion Programme is almost finalised. I am advised that it is currently in peer review process in the ESRI. It is anticipated that it will be available shortly.  </p>  <p>  The review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future. It will, amongst other things, examine the School Completion Programme structures, and how they can best support an integrated approach to address early school leaving. </p>  <p>  The preliminary findings of the review indicate that the School Completion Programme encompasses a broad range of measures and interventions that have been developed by local projects to address the needs of children over the years. The findings in the review will cover the processes involved in identifying target children for support, the form and focus of the supports provided and the complexities involved in measuring the outcomes for children at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The final report on the review will make findings and recommendations on these aspects of the programme and on strengthening the current governance and programme structures and on the resourcing of the programme.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it is the Agency&rsquo;s intention to engage in widespread consultation with a view to future development of the programme in line with the emerging needs of children. </p>  <p>  I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services. The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency&rsquo;s educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.</p></reply>

The target is to lift over 70,000 children (aged 0-17 years) out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.</p>  <p>  The Social Inclusion Monitor, published by the Department of Social Protection, reports on progress towards the child poverty target, by providing regular, timely and accessible updates on key national indicators. The Monitor is primarily based on statistics from the annual Central Statistics Office Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC), the official data source for poverty indicators.  </p>  <p>  The latest edition of the Social Inclusion Monitor, based on 2013 SILC data, reports that 138,000 children were in consistent poverty, an increase of 23,000 children on 2012. </p>  <p>  Overall, children have a consistent poverty rate of 11.7 per cent, compared to 7 per cent for adults. The consistent poverty rate for individuals in households with children is 10.8 per cent, compared to 4.7 per cent for those in non-child households. Among households with children, lone parent families have the highest rate of consistent poverty, while two adult families have the lowest rate. </p>  <p>The at-risk-of-poverty rate for children was 17.9 per cent in 2013. Social transfers (including welfare payments and child benefit) lift almost a quarter of children out of the at-risk-of-poverty. This represents a poverty reduction effect from social transfers of 60 per cent.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection provides income support for families through child benefit, qualified child increases for welfare recipients, family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, amounting to &euro;3 billion in 2014. In Budget 2015, the Government committed a further &euro;96 million for children, including an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit and the introduction of the back to work family dividend. </p>  <p>  This reflects the Government commitment to ensure that low and middle-income families benefit from the economic recovery and to assist families in moving from welfare to work.</p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as Standard Authentication Framework Environment, or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible. </p>  <p>  The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the social services card and free travel pass of the Department, and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers.  A PSC is currently issued following a registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data.  The PSC facilitates and enhances the utilisation of the PPS Number which is the individual&rsquo;s unique reference number for all dealings with Government Departments and public bodies.  Section 262 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides the basis for the allocation, use and sharing of the PPS Number.  Considerable progress has been made in the roll out of the PSC.  Up to the end of June 2015, over 1.44 million cards were issued including over 458,000 Free Travel variants. </p>  <p>  The question of the introduction or otherwise of a national identity card was not part of SAFE&rsquo;s remit.  The matter of establishing a national identity index and producing a national identity card is a wider issue.  It would require due consideration by the appropriate agencies before any policy decisions could be formulated by Government and would require the development and implementation of legislation to support any such policy. Development of policy in this area would be led by the Minister for Justice and I am not aware of any current plans for her to do so.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing approx. 34.4% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year resulting in the Department having to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million this year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.

Individuals can avail if required of the subsidised childcare supports provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. That Department currently subsidises approximately 100,000 childcare places, 25,000 of which are specifically for low income parents. This provision includes full time and after-school places as well as child care places specifically to enable parents&rsquo; avail of full time education and training courses.</p>  <p>  In order to assist lone parents to move into the workforce, the Department introduced, in partnership with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the after school childcare scheme in 2013. This scheme supports persons who are unemployed as well as customers who transition out of the one-parent family payment scheme. It applies to persons who take up a work position, who increase their days of employment, or who take up a place on a Departmental employment programme. The scheme provides up to 500 subsidised child care places both after-school places and after-school with pick-up service places.</p>  <p>  The community employment childcare programme was introduced in 2014 and provides subsidised part-time and after-school child care places for children up to the age of 13 years to Community Employment participants, including to lone parents. The community employment childcare scheme has an annual budget of &euro;7.5 million to provide 2,000 child care places.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the caring responsibilities that lone parents with young children have, the Government introduced in June 2013 the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  This is available to lone parents who transition from the one-parent family payment onto a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment and who have a youngest child aged under 14 years of age.  These customers are exempt from the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking full-time employment.  In effect this ensures that no lone parent with a child under the age of 14 is required to take up employment in order to receive an income support payment from the State.  Recipients of this payment can choose to work part-time, if they so wish, and still receive the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  This work can be of any pattern e.g. mornings only when their children are in school.  The Jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment allows this cohort of customers to balance their caring responsibilities and significantly reduces their requirement for child care.</p>  <p>  These customers will also receive a one to one meeting with a case officer from the Department who will assist them to produce a personal development plan and guide them towards appropriate education, training and employment opportunities.  While the customer is on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment this support is available and is not limited to the 12 month engagement that applies for other jobseekers from their one to one meeting.</p>  <p>  One-parent family payment recipients who lose their entitlement to the one-parent family payment, and who have a youngest child aged 14 years or over, can apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment, where they will be subject to the same conditionality as any other recipient of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment and will receive the same activation supports as all other jobseekers.</p></reply>

The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. This is not a grant. In Budget 2015 I extended the scheme to include rental properties, whose owners are subject to income tax.</p>  <p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 (exclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.</p>  <p>  The aim of the incentive is to stimulate increased activity in the construction sector and boost employment. It is aimed at supporting fully tax compliant builders and moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy as all expenditure and relief claims have to be registered electronically with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query as to whether the HRI will be expanded, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. However, as with all tax reliefs, the HRI will be considered as part of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill and any announcements will be made on Budget Day.</p></reply>

The Town Renewal Scheme applied in certain designated towns while the Rural Renewal Scheme applied in the counties of Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon and Sligo.  Owner/Occupier relief was given as a deduction from total income at a rate of 5% per annum over 10 years in the case of construction expenditure and 10% per annum over 10 years in the case of conversion or refurbishment expenditure.Section 23 relief was given as a deduction from the landlord's rental income.  The latest date for incurring expenditure which could qualify for relief under these schemes was 31 July 2008.  However, an earlier termination date could have applied where certain conditions were not met.</p><p>In addition to the above schemes, the Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme provided for tax relief in the form of a deduction from the landlord's rental income of expenditure incurred on the refurbishment of a rented residential property.  The expenditure was written off over 7 years at a rate of 15% per annum. This scheme applied throughout the country. The termination date for incurring expenditure which could qualify for relief under this scheme was 31 July 2008.</p><p>The latest information available on the cost of the Town Renewal and Rural Renewal schemes is a provisional cost for 2013 as follows: <table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Number of Claimants</th><th>Tax Cost &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Town Renewal</td><td>739</td><td>10.6</td></tr><tr><td>Rural Renewal</td><td>2,098</td><td>17.9</td></tr></table></p><p>This information is based on tax returns of self-assessed individuals and companies.  The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2013 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of Income Tax and Corporation Tax. There is no statistical information on the Countrywide Refurbishment scheme.</p><p>However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) provides a tax relief by way of an income tax credit on repair, renovation or improvements works on principal private residences or rental properties by tax compliant contractors.  HRI came into operation on 25 October 2013, with rental properties being brought within it from 15 October 2014.  It will run until 31 December 2015.  A qualifying residence under HRI includes a residential premises which has previously been occupied as a residence and which is acquired by an individual for the purposes of occupation by the individual as his or her principal private residence.  The premises must be so occupied upon completion of the qualifying work.  HRI would, therefore, be available towards the renovation of the type of properties referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>Data relating to the HRI is available in the &quot;Tax Expenditures&quot; section of the statistics page of the Revenue website at<i>www.revenue.ie/en/about/statistics/hri-stats.pdf.  </i>These statistics will be updated in due course.</p></reply>

If it is received as capital it will be taxed under the Capital Gains Tax rules. I am not in a position to instruct the Revenue Commissioners to apply a different treatment as suggested in the first question.</p>  <p>  In last year's Finance Act, I included provisions allowing for a measure of tax relief to the many thousands of Irish shareholders with a small shareholding in Vodafone plc who inadvertently found themselves subject to an unintended liability to income tax, PRSI and USC rather than a nil capital gains tax liability arising from a return of value payment from that company. I did this because the shareholding of very many of those individuals arose originally from their investment in Eircom plc and, as a result of which investment, they continue to carry capital losses. I considered, given the particular background in that case, that to leave those shareholders with income tax and other liabilities on foot of a decision they inadvertently made or did not make at all would have been inequitable.  This particular background is not a feature of the Standard Life return of value case.</p>  <p>  The fact that notifications of the options made by individuals in the Vodafone case last year were delayed in the post beyond the deadline date in that case or were otherwise not dealt with by the company as shareholders would have wished were not factors in my decision to provide the relief.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to say who or what is responsible for the problem that has arisen for the Irish shareholders in Standard Life plc. While I can understand the frustration of the shareholders, I do not think it an unreasonable point to make that the State should not be required to intervene by way of changing tax legislation on each occasion that a difficulty arises resulting from the administrative arrangements put in place by commercial public limited companies for dealing with their shareholders.</p>  <p>  All that said, I will give careful consideration to the views and concerns expressed by the various Deputies, as well as those of others that have been expressed to me in this matter, in the course of my preparations for the forthcoming Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The Central Bank advise me that the Code does not prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question and is generally determined by such issues as claims volumes and the nature of the product.</p><p>&quot;Whole of Life&quot; policies cover the policyholder for their entire lifetime, or for as long as the policyholder wishes to continue to pay premiums. The Central Bank has previously advised that premiums for such policies are not fixed and can increase over the duration of the policy. &quot;Whole of Life&quot; policies which cover the policyholder for their entire lifetime while the policy is active must be distinguished from &quot;Term Life&quot; insurance policies which cover a fixed period of time such as 10 or 20 years and have a fixed premium unless index linked.</p><p>Most firms state in their current terms and conditions of &quot;Whole of Life&quot; policies that they will carry out regular post sale reviews.  The post-sale policy review will determine if it is likely that the premium currently being paid can maintain the current level of life cover until the next review date. If it seems likely that the fund value of the policy will not be sufficient to maintain the policy to the next review date, the firm will recommend that the policyholder either increase their premium or reduce the level of life cover provided by the policy.</p><p>Policyholders who feel that the premium increases which have been proposed by their insurer are unfair are advised to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman for adjudication at <i>www.financialombudsman.ie/.</i></p></reply>

The valuation is not affected by any repairs/improvements made to a property or by any general increase/decrease in property prices that occur over the course of the valuation period.</p>  <p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy is referring, the person in question filed the statutory Return for the 2013 to 2016 period and self-assessed valuation Band 4, which was equal to the Revenue estimate that issued to her. The Revenue estimate is not based on a valuation of the property and only comes into play where the property owner fails to file the statutory Return. Once the property owner files the statutory Return and assesses a particular valuation band, as happened in this case, then the estimate ceases to have any effect. </p>  <p>  The person recently submitted an amended Return indicating a Band 1 valuation instead of the previously declared Band 4 valuation. The LPT team subsequently made direct contact with the person to discuss the issue and to establish the reason for seeking such a reduction.

Up to end of May this year, some 32.8 million cigarettes have been seized. Notable seizures have included quantities of 7.68 million, 10.3 million and 9 million.</p>  <p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade has been, and continues to be, a priority for Revenue. Their actions include a range of measures to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved. Their multifaceted strategy also includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and deployment of technologies and optimising the deployment of resources.</p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue's goal to intercept the supply of illicit tobacco products. Revenue also target the illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p>  <p>  Revenue co-operates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other tax administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p>  <p>  The extent of the illegal trade in cigarettes is estimated through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI. Assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantities of cigarettes, the results of these surveys indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT in 2014 was of the order of &euro;210 million.</p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of measures in recent years to assist Revenue in dealing with tobacco smuggling and illegal tobacco sales. Measures in the Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excisable products. </p>  <p>  In the Finance Act 2013, I introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit tobacco production, and provision for forfeiture of any equipment, materials, or unmanufactured tobacco used for illicit production. </p>  <p>  In the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, I strengthened the obligation on a person suspected of dealing in unstamped tobacco products to provide information to a Revenue officer or a Garda and to present any tobacco products concerned for examination. This measure also allows the officer or Garda to search any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against the illegal tobacco trade. I will consider any proposals for additional measures that are shown to be of assistance to Revenue in this area.</p></reply>

Its value is based on a basket of four key international currencies; the euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling and U.S. dollar.</p><p>This funding was provided in twelve individual tranches, the last of which was drawn down in December 2013.

If a risk of flooding has arisen due to this issue, it is open to the Council to apply to the OPW for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to undertake flood protection measures. Any application received would be assessed under the eligibility criteria of the Scheme, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding. The local authority may also carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.</p>  <p>  A national programme of CFRAM Studies, which is being carried out by several engineering consultancies over six regions on behalf of OPW, is focused on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs). The designated AFAs were selected following the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) phase in 2011. Arising from the PFRA, Athea has been designated as one of the AFAs and is being assessed under the Shannon CFRAM Study which OPW is currently undertaking in partnership with the relevant local authorities, including Limerick City and County Council.  </p>  <p>  Under the Study, draft predictive flood mapping has been produced for Athea.  A Public Consultation Day on the draft flood maps was held in Athea on 25 September, 2014.  The draft flood maps are currently available for inspection on the Shannon CFRAM Study website www.shannoncframstudy.ie.  A national consultation process on the draft flood mapping for the 300 AFAs is scheduled to take place in the autumn. Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the assessment of appropriate flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risk identified. The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for future State investment in flood defences.</p></reply>

A further reduction for higher value pensions was introduced in July 2013. </p>  <p>  In welcoming the proposals developed between public service employers and the representative associations and unions for an extension to the Haddington Road Agreement out to September 2018, I indicated that I intended to bring forward separate proposals to Government to provide for a commensurate reduction in the Public Service Pension Reduction as it applies to retired public servants. </p>  <p>  In line with my stated commitments I secured Government approval on the 16 June  last to move towards reducing the burden of public service pension reductions.  In overall terms the proposals agreed in relation to  PSPR will remove entirely the lower paid PSPR-affected pensioners (in general those with pre-PSPR pensions of up to &euro;34,132) from the impact of the measure. For those PSPR-affected pensioners not completely removed from the PSPR "net", the changes, when fully implemented in 2018, will in most cases deliver a full year pension boost of &euro;1,680, comprised of &euro;400, &euro;500 and &euro;780 on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 respectively. The proposals are designed to favour those on lower public service pensions to the greatest extent possible consistent with the requirement to amend the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation on which the Public Service Pension Reduction is statutorily based.</p>  <p>  Further details of these agreed measures can be found on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The Irish Patents Office (IPO) implements the system of intellectual property protection across all formal types (patent, trademark, industrial designs, copyright), and provides input in the drafting of certain legislation and in the formulation of policy.  The website of the Irish Patents Office offers a range of orientation and guidance material on uses of Intellectual Property for businesses, as well as a Good Practice Guide on how to better integrate IP into business plans and strategies.  There are links to a number of searchable databases for patents, trademarks and designs, though the IPO recommend taking professional assistance in doing so rather than self-searching.  The IPO participates in introductory courses for people wishing to start a business organised by Local Enterprise Offices. </p>  <p>  Patents are protected under the 1992 Irish Patents Act, with both full (20 years) and short-term (10 years) patents available by registering an application with the IPO.  A process is currently underway to participate in the Unitary Patent System, with a local branch to be established in Dublin, which would facilitate businesses or inventors filing actions under patent law in a single court case to decide on the validity of patents throughout 25 EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Copyrights enforcement is automatic (Irish Copyrights Act 2000), with no requirement to register a copyright.  This places the emphasis of protection on the creator.  Copyright legislation is currently under review, following the Modernising Copyright review (2013), which made recommendations to streamline and simplify the processes of protecting Copyright, from undertaking the full amount of exemptions permissible in the EU, to offering early and expeditious resolution structures. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports Intellectual Property (IP) activities among its client companies via the Research and Development Fund and High Potential Start-up equity support.  These initiatives can cover IP activities where they represent an important part of an R&amp;D project or the formation of a new company.  Support for the preparation, filing and validation of a patent application is available as well as costs incurred in renewing the application before the patent/right has been granted.  Such costs include translation and other costs incurred in order to obtain the granting or validation of the right in other appropriate countries. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also coordinates the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), a non-financial support to assist SMEs become more innovative. The EEN helps companies in identifying licensable technologies and provides advice on best practice for Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management and through the EU IPR Helpdesk.  The EEN services are specifically designed for SMEs but are also available to all businesses and Higher Education Institutions. </p>  <p>  The EU IPR Helpdesk is the official IP service initiative of the European Commission and offers free of charge, first-line support on IP and IPR matters to beneficiaries of EU funded research projects and EU SMEs.  In addition, the EU IPR Helpdesk offers free of charge training events on different aspects of IP management and IPR based on a practical and comprehensive training approach. </p>  <p>  One of the main objectives of the EU IPR Helpdesk is to raise IP awareness and build capacities among European SMEs all across Europe. </p>  <p>  This is done by offering on-site training events in the different European countries, by participating in awareness-raising events, by providing individual consultancy through the IPR Helpdesk and by developing and disseminating a broad range of useful publications such as guidelines, case studies and fact sheets that deal with different aspects of IP &ndash; both in business and in collaborative research. </p>  <p>  IDA support in this area relates to the R&amp;D activity itself rather than protection of the output of that activity by way of registering IP and patents.  IDA Ireland multinational clients have well-established IP protection policies which would apply to their Irish subsidiaries.  While IDA Ireland does not have a dedicated scheme to support IP protection alone, it would be expected that client companies would seek to protect IP arising from IDA Ireland grant supported R&amp;D projects.</p>  <p>  Indirect supports for IP are available to firms in Ireland via a variety of tax-related measures, including; tax relief for capital expenditure incurred by companies on the provision or acquisition of intangible assets for the purpose of trade; credit for foreign royalty income; withholding tax on patent royalty payments and stamp duty exemptions.</p>  <p>  In this regard the State&rsquo;s R&amp;D Tax Credit scheme is a very important element of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax regime in terms of attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and deepening the research capabilities of firms based in Ireland.  The firm commitment to the continuation and development of the R&amp;D Tax Credit scheme is a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering for both foreign direct investment and Irish enterprises. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance announced in the context of Budget 2015 that consideration is being given to the introduction of a Knowledge Development Box &ndash; a competitive income-based regime for intangible assets - along the lines of patent and innovation boxes which exist in other countries.  In this light, a public consultation process has been launched to gather views on how the Knowledge Development Box should operate.</p>  <p>  The environmental conditions for IP are considered to be good in Ireland, based on a comparative review across a number of European countries, such as Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Germany.  </p>  <p>  This review is titled - Enhancing the Intellectual Property Activities in the Firm Base in Ireland (Technopolis 2015) - and will be published on Thursday 9 July. Ireland is committed to enforcement of IP, with a strong legal base and active courts.  We have a modern legislative framework that includes a Common Law jurisdiction with an independent court system and legal protections for the creators and owners of IP.  Ireland is also party to the majority of international co-operations treaties and memberships, such as the EPC and TRIPS Agreement, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), European Patent Office (EPO), European Community (EU), Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM), the World Trade Organisation and various WIPO-administered Treaties.</p></reply>

The company bought the Clonmel based spirits business of C&amp;amp;C in 2010.  This comprised the brands of Tullamore Dew, Carolan&rsquo;s Cream and Irish Mist.  They subsequently sold the last two brands.  Production of the Tullamore Dew brand was enabled by long term agreements with other whiskey suppliers and the company continued to bottle Tullamore Dew in Clonmel.  The company subsequently decided to set up their own distillery.  The first phase completed in late 2014 is for a malt and unmalted distillery at a total investment of &euro;35m. A second phase to build a grain distillery is currently underway.  The activities concerning Tullamore Dew that have historically been located in Clonmel will now be transferred to Tullamore and integrated into the new distillery facility. </p><p>For the other two brands, a co-packing arrangement was included on the Clonmel site, bottling Carolan&rsquo;s and Irish Mist.  The co-packing arrangement was reviewed in September 2014 and the company lost the contract.  The notice to terminate the arrangement will take effect in September 2015.  Redeployment to Tullamore as well as the timing of the relocation of business are now subject to discussions with employees.  On completion of the distillery and supporting services in Tullamore, it is estimated that the employment will grow on that site from a base of 66 in 2014 to 107 by 2019.</p><p>The company reiterate that they have consistently communicated with their employees about the long term future of the business.</p><p>In regard to any possible job losses, Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation, which offers extensive protections to employees.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  NERA information personnel are available to meet staff of the affected companies, either individually or collectively, to discuss their employment rights, including matters related to redundancy.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90.  The website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie </i>also provides extensive information on employment rights.

I would like to assure the Deputy that the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery is available, if requested, to assist the parties in resolving this dispute. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.</p>  <p>  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.</p></reply>

The Thoroughbred horse industry is worth over &euro;1bn per annum to the Irish economy and provides employment for in excess of 14,000 people.  The industry attracts significant inward investment and is export orientated with export sales of Irish bred horses to 34 countries in 2014.  The sport horse industry contributes in excess of &euro;708 million per annum and provides 12,512 full time job equivalents, according to a 2012 report commissioned by Horse Sport Ireland.  Almost 50,000 people participate in the sector.  Financial support is provided by my Department to the thoroughbred sector, through Horse Racing Ireland, from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was established under section 12 (1) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 (the Act) for the purpose of giving support to the horse and greyhound racing industries.</p>  <p>  Regarding sport horses an annual grant is provided by my Department to Horse Sport Ireland (HSI), for the development and promotion of the Irish Sport Horse, breeding and production sector, the operation of the Irish Horse Register and for administration costs.  Capital grant assistance is also provided under the Equine Infrastructures scheme to organisations in the sport horse sector assist in the pursuit of improved breeding.  Aid is provided in this regard for activities which support education of breeders, performance testing of horses, DNA typing, support for the establishment, maintenance and upgrading of databases, genetic indexing, research into equine disease and website development. </p>  <p>My Department does not provide support for harness racing, which has been a minority-interest sport in this country, with fixtures staged throughout the year at venues outside of authorised racecourses.

However, at the end of June the average year to date price was running at approximately 4% ahead of the same period last year.  Just this week, I understand that prices have started to rise again and that demand for sheep and lamb by factories is rising.  Prices during the second quarter have been affected by the combination of strong supplies, with a higher average carcass weight, and a reduction in demand on both the domestic market and in our key export markets.  This may be attributable in part to the warm weather and a lower than normal increase in demand during Ramadan.  At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector.  The Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) has been continued for a third and final year in 2015.  In committing funding of &euro;3 million to the programme I am acknowledging the success of the scheme in 2013 and 2014 in which 4,000 producers participated.  Under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 -2020 I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the Knowledge Transfer Groups measure, which has an overall budget of &euro;100 million.  The experience in STAP has informed the development of this measure.  In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and facilitators in order to customise information exchange. </p>  <p>  The Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) in the RDP will benefit sheep farmers and they will continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme.  Also, a series of capital investment schemes are being introduced under the TAMS II scheme, several of which will provide for sheep farmers.</p>  <p>  As far as live exports are concerned, my Department continues to play its part in facilitating live exports of sheep while ensuring that all the necessary veterinary conditions set by the EU are satisfied.  Ireland has a healthy live export trade that operates to a high standard and a significant infrastructural capacity of exports points, vehicles and vessels available, allied to a significant number of experienced live exporters, to facilitate the live export trade.</p>  <p>  The recently launched Food Wise 2025 report acknowledges the importance of the sheep sector and notes that growth in the sector will come from improved technical efficiencies, as well as growth opportunities from an increase in consumer demand and export market opportunities.  On the export front, my Department continues to search for new markets in consultation with the meat industry, and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad.  For example during my visit to China leading a Trade Mission in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheep questionnaire which we had been asked to complete in connection with our efforts to gain access to the Chinese market for shee pmeat.  This represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheep meat in the future.  I also raised the issue of access with my US counterpart Tom Vilsack when we last met in February of this year and progress here depends on the lifting by the US of its ban on sheep meat from the EU.</p></reply>

Planning for the post quota period had been ongoing amongst all stakeholders for a number of years and I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence.  Notwithstanding the overriding opportunity that a quota free environment will bring I remain acutely aware that addressing issues such as borrowings and financial constraints will be key challenges for the dairy sector and for farmers in particular in the context of various factors such as price volatility, investment and shorter term borrowings and super-levy repayments.  My Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements.  For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, established by the Government as a strategic SME funding company, has recently launched a new &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo; product.  This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.</p>  <p>  In relation to accessing finance and credit terms generally, I retain ongoing contact with the main banks, most recently meeting directly with them earlier this year.  I emphasised that this is a critical phase in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy expansion and that the increased investment and output from production and processing will have significant downstream benefits across the economy generally, including for the banking sector.</p>  <p>  In order to support the on-going development of the dairy sector and to mitigate the current difficulties caused by milk price volatility, I asked them to explore the full range of potential measures that could serve to alleviate the loan repayment burden facing farmers and offer maximum flexibility for dairy farmers in what will be a difficult year ahead.  I believe that it is essential that short term cash flow difficulties are not allowed to undermine prudent investment plans or the longer term competitiveness of their operations.  I will continue to communicate with the main banks on issues affecting the sector.</p>  <p>  Another aspect to addressing this issue is the utilisation of provisions under the regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds (including the Rural Development Programme - RDP), where it is open to Member States to fund interventions via financial instruments.  Essentially, financial instruments offer an alternative to the traditional grant based approach whereby schemes under the RDP may be funded via loans, guarantee funds or equity investments.  The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on our existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding.  It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources such as the European Investment Bank.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has indicated that it is aiming to double the usage of these financial instruments in the 2014-2020 programming period.  Officials in my Department have been engaging with the European Commission, EIB and other stakeholders in order to identify areas where financial instruments could be implemented to best strategic effect.  They are also exploring the practical steps which are required in order to implement financial instruments and put in place a clear plan based on real market failures and economic needs.</p>  <p>  As well as the issues outlined above, it is worth mentioning at this stage that I have also been proactive in other areas in terms of ensuring the right balance of measures are in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new quota free era with confidence.  On-going contact has been maintained with the Minister for Finance to ensure that existing and future taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture. Of interest to dairy farmers here will be the announcement in last October&rsquo;s budget to provide for income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills.  I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan.</p>  <p>  Finally and importantly, in terms of super-levy impacts I certainly recognise the difficulty that this causes for farmers here and for that reason I have taken the decision to make the 3 year interest free instalment arrangement available to all those affected.  This is now open for applications by farmers.  The first instalment must be collected by the milk purchaser in the normal way and paid to my Department before 1 October 2015 and the two subsequent payments must be paid by similar dates in 2016 and 2017.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe that the dairy sector can look to the future with confidence.  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong.  I am confident that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand whilst simultaneously addressing these challenges as outlined above.</p></reply>

I expect the delegated sanction arrangements for the management of staff numbers in Teagasc to be finalised shortly.  Formal delegated sanction will be subject to Teagasc compliance with binding pay bill ceilings.  Within the parameters of that over arching policy, the question of allocating additional resources to the advisory service is an operational matter for Teagasc.   </p>  <p>  Teagasc is also re-configuring the way in which it delivers advisory services.  The actions include greater use of discussion groups, sub-contracting the delivery of non-core work, and establishing strategic alliances with private providers.

In addition Member States have the discretion to add further eligibility criteria as regards appropriate skills and/or training requirements.  To qualify as a &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo;, a person must meet all of the following conditions: S/he is aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when s/he first submits an application under the Basic Payment Scheme; S/he is setting up an agricultural holding for the first time or has set up such a holding during the five years preceding the first submission of the Basic Payment Scheme application; S/he has successfully completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 or its equivalent.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement for a young farmer to participate in farming on a full time basis.  However, the young farmer must exercise control over the farming enterprise, either solely or jointly with one or more other farmers, in terms of management, benefits and financial risks.  The Young Farmers Scheme provides an additional payment per entitlement activated by the young farmer up to a maximum of 50 entitlements. </p>  <p>  Persons who meet the definition of young farmer are automatically eligible to participate in the National Reserve and in the Young Farmers Scheme.  The National Reserve allocates entitlements on the basis of one entitlement per eligible hectare declared by the young farmer up to a maximum of 90 entitlements.  Existing entitlements with a value below the national average will be increased to the national average. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the National Reserve applies an off-farm income threshold whereby persons in receipt of an off-farm income greater than &euro;40,000 in either 2013 or 2014 will not be eligible for an allocation of entitlements from the Reserve.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to facilitate environmentally friendly practices, promote the diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products and improve working conditions. </p>  <p>  The 2015 round of the Scheme was heavily oversubscribed with applicants seeking in excess of &euro;8.5m in aid when the approved 2015 budget for the Scheme was &euro;4.2m. </p>  <p>  Each individual proposed investment is assessed on its merits by a Selection Committee established to award funding.  The Selection Committee decides which horticulture-specific investments would make the strongest contribution to the objectives of the Scheme within the available budget. </p>  <p>  As the Scheme is targeted at commercial producers of horticultural products, the Department has very limited involvement with local authorities in fostering urban horticulture.  However, under the CEDRA remit for which Minister of State Phelan has responsibility, a new pilot scheme will be advertised very shortly to assist social farming operations.  Social farming offers work experience on farms, horticultural operations or with animals to people, many of whom are from urban areas, who avail of a range of day support services and as such provides a range of benefits to farm families, service users and society as a whole.   </p>  <p>  Bord Bia also has some limited involvement with Local Authorities in the urban Horticulture arena. Such involvement includes: amenity horticulture businesses use their Bord Bia Quality Programme certification when tendering to provide product and services to local authorities.  Dublin City Council have been involved with the Bloom event and during 2015 supported the Bloom fringe activity in the City and activity on site.  The organisation of certain horticulture events organised at public authority venues, such as the Rare and Special Plant Fair.</p>  <p>  My Department also funds the Food Dudes programme managed by Bord Bia.  This aims to increase children&rsquo;s fruit and vegetable consumption by repeat tasting, supported by role models (Food Dudes Heroes) and small rewards.  The original programme was completed in 2014 having reached 477,423 primary school children in 3,127 schools (95% of primary schools). </p>  <p>  A Boost Programme commenced in primary schools in 2014 with the Junior Cycle tasting fruit and vegetables daily for a 16 day period and the Senior Cycle enjoying 4 tasting days.  Additional Department and EU funding under the EU School Fruit and Vegetables Scheme will double the reach of Food Dudes/EU School Fruit and Vegetables Scheme over two years to 800 schools and 160,000 children in 2015/2016, compared to 390 schools and 70,000 children in the 2013/2014 school year. </p>  <p>  The programme has been evaluated a number of times and shown to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and that this is sustained over time.</p></reply>

The payments audited covered the period from 2008 to 2012 during which over &euro;9 billion was paid to farmers in Ireland under the Direct Payment Schemes. My Department strongly refuted the application of this proposed correction as disproportionate to the true level of risk involved and accordingly sought a hearing with the Conciliation Body.</p>  <p>  The Conciliation Body met with the Commission and officials from my Department separately in December 2014. The Commission held their position on the 2% flat rate correction before and during their meeting. The report of the Conciliation Body concluded that conciliation seemed within reach and that the Commission and my Department should continue to work together towards an agreed settlement. My Department has maintained regular contact with the Commission and has completed further work to quantify the level of risk to EU funds. This work was the subject of the Commission visit to Ireland during the third week of May 2014. Contact with the Commission is continuing on this issue.</p></reply>

Currently Defence Forces personnel are operating in the following locations in sub-Saharan Africa; Western Sahara, Mali, Sierra Leone, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire and Democratic Republic of the Congo.  There are three anti-malarial drugs, all licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), formerly the Irish Medicines Board, in use by the Defence Forces namely Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline. The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. As the Deputy will be aware, the HPRA is the statutory authority with responsibility for quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland.

This Government has also substantially reduced  the costs of bankruptcy - from around &euro;1400 in total in 2012, to just &euro;270 euro from 1 January 2015. While bankruptcy used to be predominantly sought by creditors, since late 2013 almost all bankruptcies are sought by the debtor.</p>  <p>  I recently referred the issue of reducing the bankruptcy term from three years to one year, and the associated topics raised in a recent Private Members' Bill by Deputy Willie Penrose, to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, with a request that the Committee report to Government on its conclusions before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  Both the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, contain provisions which are designed to ensure that agreed solutions, which are fair to all parties, are made available for debtors struggling with unsustainable debts, and in particular, that loss of the mortgaged home is an option of last resort.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, on 13 May the Government agreed a series of further measures to support borrowers struggling with unsustainable mortgage arrears. These include a major reform of the personal insolvency legislation, which will give the Courts the power to review (and, where appropriate, to impose) a proposed personal insolvency arrangement that has been refused by creditors, subject to certain conditions.  The relevant amending legislation is a priority for me and the Government and will reflect the very fundamental principle that loss of ownership of a family home through repossession should be a last resort. </p></reply>

This report is comprehensive and includes 173 recommendations covering almost every aspect of the protection system and related parts of the process.  The recommendations and their implications will be carefully considered by Government over the coming weeks.  Many of the recommendations are of a cross cutting nature and will require further consultation with other Government Departments and Offices in the context of planning for their implementation.  My clear intention is to go back to Government as soon as possible with proposals regarding implementation of the report's recommendations, including those specifically relating to families and children.</p></reply>

I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are taking all necessary steps to thoroughly investigate these crimes and identify the perpetrators. It is of course essential that anyone who may have information about such crimes, even if appears insignificant, should contact the Garda. The Deputy will appreciate that as Garda investigations into these matters are ongoing I cannot comment in more detail on the specific policing responses which are being pursued.</p>  <p>  In recent times An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have supported a number of partnership initiatives in relation to crimes affecting rural communities. A particular recent example is the campaign launched on 20 February to combat the problem of livestock theft, jointly organised by Crimestoppers, the Irish Farmers Association and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This campaign is calling on members of the public and in particular those in the farming community with information on the theft of cattle and sheep to come forward with information. A reward fund of &euro;10,000 is available for significant information. Information can be given anonymously to the Crimestoppers confidential telephone service by calling 1800 25 00 25. Alternatively, information can be provided to any Garda station.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaged in a range of targeted operations to disrupt the activities of organised mobile gangs who may be involved in the crimes referred to. In particular, Operation Fiacla is the national intelligence and analysis-led Garda operation targeting burglary and related property crimes throughout the country and is an important element in the Garda response to the concerns of rural communities about recent crime trends. I am pleased to say that I recently   announced additional resources for new specialised vehicles to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to current and emerging crime threats, including the crimes referred to, being committed by highly mobile gangs.</p>  <p>  I should also point out that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to work closely with communities through Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other community based groups to provide expert crime prevention advice. This includes advice in respect of crimes targeted at farms and in this regard a Garda Farm Security Booklet is available. In addition, revised guidelines have been published for communities wishing to set up community crime prevention schemes or to revitalise existing ones.</p>  <p>  In conclusion I might also highlight the success of the Garda Text Alert Scheme which was developed with the participation of partners including Muintir na Tire and the Irish Farmers Association. This initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 600 local groups involving in excess of 120,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages being sent each month. I am advised that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups.</p></reply>

The Court Service works with the Presidents to ensure that court sittings are supported and that delays in the hearing of cases are kept to a minimum particularly in relation to the hearing of Family Law cases. During the summer recess High Court sittings are held to deal with urgent and priority matters.</p><p>In the Circuit Court, there does not seem to be any significant issues regarding delays in hearing family law cases. In the past 12 - 18 months, the President of the Court has prioritised family law and additional judges have been assigned to areas where the waiting times were considered to be unacceptable. Where cases are not dealt with within 3 - 6 months, this is often due to either one party or both parties seeking adjournments some of which may be related to the availability of legal aid. In relation to the small number of cases on hands for 12 months or more and many of these cases have actually been dealt with, but are awaiting &quot;complete finalisation&quot; due to ancillary issues such as pension adjustment issues or sales of property etc. Scheduled sittings of the Circuit Courts are held every two weeks in Dublin during the summer recess and judges are available in all areas of the country to deal with urgent applications.</p><p>The District Family Courts are currently working  to manage the existing workload and maintain the current level of waiting times. Emergency applications such as Protection Orders are given priority. Such applications are usually granted, where the Court so decides, on the date the application is made to the Court. Typically interim barring orders which are also an emergency application are also made <i>ex parte</i>and granted on the date of application. There are therefore no delays in dealing with such applications. During August, two family law courts sit every day to deal with urgent applications and priority matters. In addition at least one scheduled court sitting is held every week in each District around the country and more sittings are scheduled for larger venues such as Cork. Judges are also available to hear urgent matters as required.</p><p>Aside from the emergency applications referred to above, the primary domestic violence relief is the granting of a Barring Order. When a Protection Order is granted by a Court, a barring order summons is issued. I am concerned that delays in this critical area be kept to the absolute minimum possible, and my Department and the Courts Service will be keeping this important matter under close review in the autumn.</p><p>Outside, of Dublin, Barring Order applications are generally listed for the next dedicated family law day (most Districts have at least one day per month dedicated to family law). Applications for Barring Orders are prioritised within court lists and a decision is generally made on such applications on the first listing date. Where adjournments occur they are generally granted at the request of one or both parties.</p><p>The Legal Aid Board is responsible for providing civil legal aid in the State. With the exception of a very small number of cases it is not free. Most clients pay a contribution for legal advice and a further contribution if they require representation in court.</p><p>The Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides that a person shall not be granted legal aid unless the person is granted a legal aid certificate in respect of the legal aid sought. When a person is granted a legal aid certificate, they have a period of one month to sign the certificate to indicate that they accept the terms upon which it is granted and to pay the contribution required, if any. Once the certificate has been validly accepted there is no &ldquo;expiry date&rdquo; on the certificate and it remains valid for the duration of the proceedings for which it was granted, i.e. until the order sought has been granted or refused, judgement has been delivered, or the case is settled.</p></reply>

Section 4 (3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system.</p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the information requested is provided in the following tables.  I am informed that where a person is convicted and disqualified for an offence, details of the disqualification imposed including the driver licence number, where recorded, are sent to the National Driver Licence Service.  Where the person is convicted of a penalty point offence, details of the conviction imposed including a driver licence number, where recorded, are sent to the National Vehicle and Driver File for the application of penalty points as appropriate.  However, where a person is convicted of a penalty point offence and is disqualified from driving, details of the conviction are not sent to the National Vehicle and Driver File but rather are notified to the National Driver Licence Service.</p><p>It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act to fail to provide your licence details and, as I have recently advised the Deputy, an arrangement has been put in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to facilitate the bringing of prosecutions for the non-production of a driver licence in these circumstances.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will shortly commence prosecutions at multiple locations nationwide, targeting persons not presenting their licences in Court. </p><p>I expect this will send a strong message that it is essential that our Road Traffic laws are respected and that there are consequences for the minority of persons who seek to evade them. Ultimately enforcement and prosecution of offences in this area is about improving public safety and reducing deaths on our roads, and there must be no way out for anybody seeking to avoid receiving penalty points.</p><p>I can further advise the Deputy that my Department is in ongoing and intensive contact with the other relevant agencies with a view to ensuring that the most effective system to associate penalty points with driver licences is in place.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have recently received an update from the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group on this matter and we have asked that further urgent consideration be given to this specific issue with a view to more detailed analysis being submitted later this year.  In addition to assessing the impact of the prosecutions referred to above, this analysis will consider other means of addressing this issue, including an examination of the feasibility and means of introducing a mandatory association between driver licence details and vehicle registrations.<table><tr><th>Court Area</th><th>No. of Persons Convicted Under Road Traffic Act</th><th>No. of Persons

Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and if necessary is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  This may lead to the child being placed on the child protection notification system (CPNS).  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are responsible for any investigations of a criminal nature.  Children First guidelines provide for the formal notification by Tusla where abuse is suspected and, where it has not been possible to establish grounds for a formal report, the guidelines indicate that an informal consultation is encouraged to protect the welfare of the child.  Tulsa has a number of local offices in each of its 17 administrative areas.  Information for Tusla's services, including contact numbers, is available on its website and locally.</p>  <p>  Provisional figures for 2014 show that there were 43,179 referrals of child protection and welfare concerns received by Tusla in 2014.  This is an increase on the total number of referrals received in 2013, which stands at 41,599.  The majority of referrals, almost 58%, are in relation to child welfare concerns, with the remaining 42% relating to child protection. Referrals can come from a number of sources so there are some duplicates in these totals, and some will be more appropriate for more universal services, such as those provided in the education or health sectors.  Also, not all referrals will result in a need for a social work service or in a child being received into care.  As a result, every year, approximately 50% of referrals can be expected to proceed from preliminary enquiry to the initial assessment stage.</p>  <p>  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service. Of the total number of open cases at the end April, 20,417 had an allocated social worker and 7,965 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  The number of cases waiting to be allocated a social worker is an issue that is being addressed by Tusla. The priority or category of high, medium or low given to the case after a preliminary enquiry, is based on information received. It is important to note that "high priority" should not simply be equated with risk. Social work duty teams keep high priority cases under review by regular checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will re-prioritise the case.  At the close of April 2015, the number of children in care was reported as 6,420 children, of whom 93% were in a foster care setting.  The number of children in care represents just under 23% of the total of 28,382 open cases reported by Tusla at the end of April. A national review of cases waiting allocation of a social worker is at an advanced stage.  I expect that this will be submitted to me shortly and this will inform the overall approach by Tusla for the budget and deployment of social work staff.</p>  <p>  In addition to services provided by Tusla and its own complaints mechanism in which specific issues may be raised, the child welfare and protection services are overseen by independent bodies.  This includes the Ombudsman for Children, the Health Information and Quality Authority, in terms of inspections, and CORU, which regulates health and social care professionals.  My Department also maintains regular contact with a range of non-governmental bodies to consult on any particular areas of interest or concern that may arise in the sector.  Work is proceeding to ensure that all high priority cases receive a timely and effective service in this demand led service.</p></reply>

The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between Health Service Divisions and Tusla.</p>  <p>  Tusla is also proposing to put in place a Service Level Agreement with the HSE to strengthen current arrangements.  The Service Level Agreement will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency's requirements.</p>  <p>  Clinical psychology services are directly provided by Tusla within multi-disciplinary teams deployed by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).

Officials also meet Tusla management as needed as well as regular meetings on a monthly and quarterly basis.  Tusla has internal mechanisms for quality assurance of its services, in addition to the regulatory monitoring requirements, which include regular visits by a social worker to children in care.  My officials use information provided by Tusla to monitor the current status of service provision and the effect as reforms to services take effect.  Activity indicators allow for attention to be focussed on areas where further improvement is required.  In addition to regular reports, Tusla also provides occasional or special topic reports, as needed, which can then be used for budget and resource planning.  For example, Tusla is preparing a national review of cases waiting the allocation of a social worker which will inform plans for social worker recruitment and deployment in the short to medium term.   </p>  <p>  In  addition to the reporting arrangements with Tusla, my Department also reviews the findings of a number of independent bodies, which are made available in the inspection reports from the Health Information and Quality Authority, reports on child deaths and serious incidents from the independently chaired National Review Panel, and reports from the Ombudsman for Children.  Contact is maintained with the non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, EPIC and the Irish Foster Care Association.  My Department chairs an Inter Departmental Group on the implementation of Children First.  This group works to ensure that all bodies working with children, including those with particular vulnerabilities, are aware of their responsibilities with regard to the welfare and protection of children and are provided with the necessary training and guidance to support them in this work.  The information gained from these various avenues relates not just to deficits in the child welfare and protection service but, equally, to good practice and positive outcomes.  This information informs the interactions my Department has with Tusla on the quality and performance of the services to vulnerable children. </p>  <p>  It is also the case that Tusla would inform my Department of specific issues where risks are identified and to ensure that effective management responses are put in place.  This recently occurred when Tusla informed  me of issues that had arisen in the Midlands and Louth/Meath administrative areas.  I was briefed early by Tusla on actions to rectify these issues.  I am happy to say from briefings provided to me by Tusla management that the response has been positive and that they are delivering on the action plans.  At the end of the work in these administrative areas, there will be improved services and, also, a tried and tested model for short term and rapid improvements should this be needed in the future.</p></reply>

Child Protection and Welfare Services provided by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency are demand led services.  Monthly, quarterly and annual reports are received from Tusla, in respect of its functions, including detailed reporting on key performance indicators. These reports give a good indication of the number of children and families in receipt of or requiring intervention.  The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to Child Welfare and Protection Services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required.  For example, data is received on referrals and assessment processes, at national level, broken down by administrative regions and local areas.  Tusla's annual service planning process is informed by monitoring and performance data from each administrative area.   </p>  <p>  Officials frequently meet with Tusla to review areas in need of improvement, and I also meet with Tusla on a quarterly basis in this regard.  There are protocols in place for the Agency to inform my Department of specific issues where risks are identified and to ensure that robust management responses are put in place.  </p>  <p>  There is a wide range of child and family support services available through both the statutory and non statutory sectors.  These include services provided by Government Departments, other state agencies and an extensive network of non governmental organisations.  In the area of child welfare and protection services we now have, with the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children, young people and families at risk.   The Agency, in discharging its functions, places a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support,  therapeutic and care interventions, all of which  are key to the provision of integrated, multi-disciplinary services for vulnerable children and families. </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department chairs an Inter Departmental Group on the implementation of Children First.  This group works to ensure that all bodies working with children, including those with particular vulnerabilities, are aware of their responsibilities with regard to the welfare and protection of children and are provided with the necessary training and guidance to support them in this work.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9 m was provided to my Department for these schemes. There was no reduction in the funding for the youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for the national voluntary youth organisations.</p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new National Youth Strategy 2015 - 2020. It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support. </p>  <p>This new strategy takes account of the social and economic factors that influence young people&rsquo;s situation, and the important roles that parents, families, friends, other adults and communities play in their lives. Its development is informed by national and European policy developments and the results of a national consultation   process. This process involved over 3,500 people, including 2,000 young people under age 25, the youth sector, NGOs working with young people, Education and Training Boards, Government departments, agencies, business and academia and other youth interests. </p>  <p>  The Strategy will identify key objectives to be achieved for young people so that they may be active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and be connected and contributing to their world.  It will identify a number of priority actions to be delivered by stakeholders including Government departments, state agencies and by the NGO sector over the years 2015 to 2017. </p>  <p>  The question of additional funding for the youth services is a matter for consideration in the context of the resources made available to my Department in the estimates and budgetary process and having regard to the priorities identified in the new National Youth Strategy for 2014-2020. My Department is working to finalise the new National Youth Strategy and it is anticipated that it may be available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Where there are reasonable grounds for concern for a child's welfare and protection, Tusla should always be informed.  This has been Tusla's responsibility since its establishment in January 2014.  </p>  <p>  As part of governance arrangements, Tusla provides my Department with regular performance activity reports for monitoring purposes.  These include figures showing the number of referrals which are disaggregated by welfare concerns and abuse concerns. The most recent validated figures for referrals to hand are up to the end Quarter 4 of 2014.  Tusla has stated that, subject to validation, the total number of referrals for 2014 shows that there were 43,200 reports of child protection and welfare concerns received by Tusla.  </p>  <p>  The most recent figures for child welfare concerns and child abuse concerns highlight that Child Welfare and Protection Services received a total of 10,492 referrals during Quarter 4 2014.  For the period in question, 6,063 (58%) were child welfare concerns  and 4,429 (42%) were child abuse concerns. </p>  <p>  In addition to the rigorous governance arrangements within Tusla, my Department also reviews the findings of a number of independent bodies including: the Health Information and Quality Authority inspection reports, reports on child deaths and serious incidents from the independently chaired National Review Panel and reports from the Ombudsman for Children.  My Department also maintains contact with non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, and the Irish Foster Care Association.  This is in addition to the day to day monitoring of children who may be at risk or children in care that is carried out by Tusla as part of its responsibilities under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, and the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.</p></reply>

In a developed primary care system, up to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  Pharmacy services are well placed within the community to provide essential health advice and to support effective care at the lowest level of complexity.  </p>  <p>  As we continue to experience increased pressure on resources within the health system, it is necessary to consider new and innovative ways to provide the services required.  Expanding the role of the community pharmacist to include provision of services such as a Minor Ailments Scheme is worth exploring as we seek to further expand and develop the primary care sector.  A Minor Ailments Scheme can offer patients real benefits in terms of improving patient access and choice in the delivery of primary care services.  It is however important that such proposals generate real savings on existing public expenditure, as the health service continues to operate within tight budget constraints.  </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged the services of the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the evidence base for such a service, including the application of such schemes in other countries. It is expected that the evidence review will be completed by the autumn. This piece of research will further inform the Department's consideration of this policy proposal, including any contractual or funding implications that may arise.</p></reply>

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  People with a disability should be able to maximise their potential and live rich and fulfilling lives.</p>  <p>  Compliance with HIQA standards for disability residential centres is a requirement under the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and voluntary service providers.</p>  <p>  66% of designated centres for people with a disability were inspected by HIQA by the end of Quarter 1 2015, including inspections triggered by complaints or allegations of mistreatment.  The lessons learned from them are continuing to improve the quality of services.  Clients and their families can be assured that this regulatory regime is being rolled out across all residential facilities for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  HIQA has reported evidence of good practice in the delivery of many residential services to people with disabilities where the support and care needs of residents have been prioritised and there is a strong focus on the needs of service users.  While HIQA&rsquo;s findings, in some cases, may make for difficult reading, they serve as evidence that the regulatory process works effectively and in the interests of protecting vulnerable people in the care of the State.  In this respect it is noted that HIQA&rsquo;s most recent report on &Aacute;ras Attracta has found significant improvements in the lives of many residents.</p>  <p>  The action plan accompanying HIQA's report of its investigation on the 28 January 2015, of a HSE operated facility for people with disabilities in Co Wexford, sets out the actions and timelines required by the HSE to meet the requirements of the Health Act 20017 (Care and Support of Residents in Designated Centres for Persons (Children and Adults) with Disabilities) Regulations 2013.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has requested the HSE to develop action plans to address cases where HIQA has raised serious concerns regarding the level of care that people with a disability are receiving in a number of disability centres, including safeguarding the human rights of residents.</p>  <p>  The HSE is implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures to improve the quality and safety of residential services for people with disabilities.  Much work remains to be carried out on an ongoing basis to ensure all facilities comply with Disability Residential Standards. While this programme will be challenging for the HSE, it is crucial in safeguarding vulnerable people in the care of the State.</p>  <p>  While this is challenging, we must remember that the objective is to safeguard vulnerable people.</p></reply>

This funding is being provided to thirty of the thirty-two organisations previously in receipt of bridging funding, including all health and disability organisations.  This further support will be based on current levels of funding to the organisations in question and is being provided through a Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations (DSSNO).  The funding, totalling &euro;1.32 million, to be provided to each organisation is set out in the table below, and each organisation is allocated the same amount of funding over the 12 months from 1 July 2015 under DSSNO as provided in the 12 months to 30 June 2015 under bridging funding.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new Scheme to Support National Organisations will be advertised in early 2016 and groups funded under the 2014-2016 Scheme to Support National Organisations and the recently announced Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations will be required to apply for funding under the single SSNO Scheme and meet the criteria required for funding. <table><tr><th>Funding allocated under Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland</td><td>53,882</td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited</td><td>58,028</td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited</td><td>37,304</td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd</td><td>16,580</td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland</td><td>16,580</td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited</td><td>19,066</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association</td><td>58,028</td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS)</td><td>33,158</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association</td><td>24,868</td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd</td><td>29,014</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association</td><td>24,868</td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re</td><td>70,462</td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland</td><td>37,304</td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited</td><td>37,304</td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd</td><td>74,606</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited</td><td>41,448</td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited</td><td>24,868</td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland</td><td>74,606</td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited</td><td>29,014</td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited</td><td>62,172</td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland</td><td>49,738</td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland</td><td>49,738</td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities</td><td>45,592</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons, including those in rural locations, rests with housing authorities.  The various Management Groups, of the regional Joint Homelessness Consultative Fora, are responsible for the preparation of regional statutory Homelessness Action Plans which specify the measures to be undertaken to address homelessness. Section 37 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides that such plans be informed by available data, the costs of measures and likely financial resources, as well as Government policies and objectives. It is a requirement of the 2009 Act that these Action Plans be submitted to each of the relevant housing authorities for adoption by the elected representative of the council. Issues around service provision, including access to emergency accommodation within the Region, are integral to the Action Plans.   </p></reply>

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.  My Department issued comprehensive guidance on preparing and maintaining the register of electors in May 2006 and further guidance has issued since then as the need arose and having regard in particular to amendments to the Electoral Acts. </p><p>An information booklet on the Register of Electors is available for download from my Department&rsquo;s websi<i>te, www.environ.ie - register of electors, in English,</i>in Irish and in fifteen other languages. In addition, my Department has provided multi-lingual prompt cards in seventeen languages to registration authorities to assist them in engaging with the public in their voter registration campaigns.</p><p>In November 2014, during the preparation of the current (2015/2016) register, 10,000 posters about voter registration were printed and posted to registration authorities, members of the D&aacute;il, youth organisations, third-level student bodies and multi-cultural groups. Registration authorities were asked to arrange to have these posters displayed in post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses, local authority offices and other suitable locations. Advertisements were placed in national daily newspapers and on-line advertisements were placed on popular websites during November. All of this activity, which takes place on an annual basis, is aimed at encouraging newly qualified voters to register and at encouraging those registered to check and to update their details.</p><p>In addition to this annual activity my Department, in the lead in to any election or referendum taking place, advertises the relevant dates for inclusion in the supplement to the register of electors.</p><p>In regard to the broader issue of voter registration in Ireland, I await the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment Culture and the Gaeltacht following their consultation on the paper I published in January on the establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland. One of the issues being considered in the context of the establishment of an Electoral Commission is the role that the Commission might play in respect of the register of electors. I understand that public hearings in the consultation are to conclude before the end of July and that the register has been a key feature in the Committee&rsquo;s considerations and in the contributions of the persons engaging with the Committee. The report to be submitted to me on the outcomes from the consultation process will inform the development of an Electoral Commission Bill.</p></reply>

Income accrues to the Environment Fund from two sources &ndash; the plastic bag levy and the landfill levy. Both of these economic instruments are designed to encourage changes in behaviour; to tackle littering of plastic bags and to reduce over-reliance on unsustainable landfill as a waste disposal method. The rates of both levies have been increased as necessary in recent years in order to achieve those policy objectives. The two levies have been extremely successful in reducing plastic bag usage and in reducing tonnage to landfill, but, as a consequence of its success from an environmental behaviour perspective, revenues to the Fund have been declining in recent years. Compared to &euro;65.7m revenue to the Fund in 2012, total revenue to the Fund dropped to some &euro;46m in 2014. The latest indications are that revenue from the landfill levy, which is the largest component of the Environment Fund, will suffer a further significant decline in 2015. Accordingly, the capacity of the Environment Fund to continue to support environmental initiatives and organisations is under increasing pressure. </p><p>In this context of a reduced Fund, I am currently giving careful consideration to the 2015 allocations and I hope to be in a position to announce these allocations in the very near future. </p></reply>

The Unit is comprised of representatives from my Department, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, Dublin City Council and the Housing Agency. It is linking with NAMA, the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, OPW and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills to determine potential State-owned properties.    The Unit is overseen by a Task Force, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and also comprising other senior officials of my Department, the Chief Executive and Assistant Chief Executive (Housing) of Dublin City Council, the Chief Valuer of Dublin City Council, the Director of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the Chief Executive and a Senior Executive of the Housing Agency. The Task Force first met on 28 April 2015 and has since met on 5 May, 11 May, 18 May, 15 June, 29 June and 6 July. On foot of its work, an initial 100 units of accommodation have been identified and their acquisition is currently in train. </p>  <p>The Task Force is also monitoring and, where necessary, invigorating other on-going actions and measures in place to address homelessness issues, such as the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Homeless Pilot; the Ministerial Direction on housing allocations; the return of vacant units to use; securing more suitable temporary emergency accommodation for families than that afforded by commercial hotels; and information and awareness campaigns for tenants and landlords. I report monthly to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on progress in relation to homelessness issues and initiatives, including those mentioned above.   </p>  <p>The administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis. The regional approach is considered effective as it brings a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need. Statutory Management Groups , established under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which include representation from each relevant housing authority, exist in every region and it is the responsibility of these groups to consider issues around the need for homeless services and to plan for the implementation and funding of such services. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive coordinates homeless services in the Dublin Region . There are no plans at present to extend this model into the Mid-East or Greater Dublin Area , nor has this been recommended to me by any of the Groups referred to in the Question.</p></reply>

The issues arising with Shared Ownership Schemes require careful consideration and expert financial data analysis.</p><p>Arising from the findings of the review to date, with effect from the 1 July 2015 the Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme (operational up to end-2002) has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments. These amendments will reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term. My Department has issued directions tolocal authorities outlining the measures and I understand these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts.</p><p>In addition, the recent reduction of 0.20% in the Local Authority variable mortgage interest rate will also benefit many Share Ownership borrowers. This new rate cut will bring the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers down to 2.55% with effect from 1 July, saving borrowers around &euro;17 per month on a typical mortgage of &euro;100,000.</p><p>My Department, together with the other agencies, will continue to examine the operation of Shared Ownership loans and issues arising for some borrowers with a view to developing further measures that may assist with the affordability of these arrangements.</p><p>Local authority borrowers should contact their local authority if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their local authority mortgage or Shared Ownership arrangement. My Department&rsquo;s latest guidelines for local authorities in dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector ,Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for LocalAuthorities (June 2014) , are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<i>www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,30943,en.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

The Council sought that provision be made through primary legislation to regulate the operation of rickshaws.</p>  <p>  As it is a requirement that a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) be prepared in respect of any proposal to Government seeking permission to regulate through primary legislation and given that rickshaws are a local matter, I have responded to the Council that it would be appropriate that the Council prepare a RIA.  The purpose of the RIA is to establish more clearly the issues that need to be addressed and the kind of regulatory initiative that is most appropriate to deal with those issues.  The RIA would include, amongst other things, an assessment of the measures that could be adopted within the existing bye-law making powers of local authorities and also help determine whether any proposal for primary legislation should be dealt with as a matter of road traffic legislation or local government legislation.</p>  <p>  Any questions about progress in that regard might be directed to the Council.</p></reply>

As regards M3 traffic patterns I have referred the Deputy's question on this matter to the NRA for direct reply. However, while the NRA monitors traffic flows on the national route network and should be able to provide information derived from its traffic counters in the vicinity, the specific origin and destination information the Deputy is seeking may not be available.</p>  <p>  Separately, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).  As the contracts for the privately operated toll schemes are commercial agreements between the NRA and the PPP concessionaires concerned I have also referred the Deputy's question regarding the operation of the M3 toll to the NRA.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

I understand this would involve the donation of artworks to an Irish cultural institution using Section 1003 tax relief.  This is a very welcome development. It is a now a matter for the Foundation to work with potential donors to make an application under the Tax Acts.  The Alfred Beit Foundation is an independent Trust and I cannot instruct it on how to do its business.</p></reply>
