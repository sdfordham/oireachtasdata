As I confirmed in the recent Budget, the 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate is, and will remain, a core part of our offering. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for stability has been earned over a long period of time, and I intend to plan for the future in that same spirit. We have a tax system with a broad base, which is designed for businesses that want to innovate and create employment. By adopting and sticking to a corporation tax system that is sustainable and which meets the highest international standards, we are in a position to offer certainty. With the current changing environment internationally, certainty has become a valuable commodity. </p>  <p>  As a small open economy, connected to Europe, the US and the wider world, we are of course affected by changes in the international environment. I do believe, however, that change also brings opportunities. The right choice for Ireland is to continue our commitment to a competitive, transparent and stable corporation tax system with a 12.5 per cent rate.</p>  <p>  In regards to direct taxation discussion at EU level, the matters currently on the ECOFIN Council agenda are the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes and the challenges of taxation of profits of the digital economy.  Both of these items will be discussed at the next ECOFIN meeting on 5 October.</p></reply>

The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties. There has also been analysis of a detailed proposal on the Sparkassen model and its possible implementation in Ireland that was put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group.  Officials from my Department have met with their representatives a number of times. </p>  <p>  In Germany, Sparkassen can only operate in specified regions and their aim is not profit maximisation but rather promoting economic development and financial inclusion in the area in which they operate. A similar model has been proposed for Irish local public banks. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been working jointly with colleagues in the Department of Community and Rural Development in order to prepare a report of the findings of their investigation. The purpose of the consultation process and report is to assist the Government in its analysis of local public banking in an Irish context. Officials have finalised the report which I have received and am currently considering.</p>  <p>  This report will outline the current banking environment in Ireland, describe the Sparkassen business model, analyse a proposal for local public banking in Ireland, summarise the view of respondents to the public consultation process and set out findings in relation to the potential for a local public banking model in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Along with my colleague, Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D., I will bring the report to Government, for approval. I would like to advise the Deputy that I expect we will be in a position do so before Christmas. Once it has gone before Cabinet, I will also provide the report to the FINPERT Committee. </p></reply>

These are points I made to US legislators when I was in the US recently. </p>  <p>  Regardless of what happens with US tax reform, Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.  Ireland remains committed to long-term stability and to the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  As always, we will remain alert and responsive to any changes in the US or global tax environment.  </p>  <p>  The level of investment from the US into Ireland cannot be attributed just to corporate tax policy &ndash; that is not a fair reflection of the many other reasons that companies choose to locate in Ireland.  Factors such as availability of physical and technological infrastructure, availability of skilled staff, access to the EU market as well as culture and quality of life are also significant and important considerations.   </p></reply>

This work is being done in parallel with the implementation of the motor report.</p><p>As part of its review, the Working Group has engaged in an extensive consultation process with a range of stakeholders including the Hotels Federation of Ireland, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners' Association, the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association, Chambers Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and a number of insurers and brokers who cover this type of risk. In addition, submissions received from interested parties such as the Irish Farmers Association were considered as part of the process.</p><p>The issues that have been raised by stakeholders include:</p><p>- the significant increase in the cost of El and PL insurance</p><p>- the lack of competition in the EL and PL market</p><p>- frustration with inconsistency of awards </p><p>- huge costs in challenging claims through the court process</p><p>- prevalence of fraudulent and exaggerated claims</p><p>- the need for the role of PIAB to be developed further</p><p>Following on from this consultation process, two sub-groups were formed to look in more detail at, respectively, legal-related matters and market-related issues and to come up with appropriate recommendations.</p><p>The Deputy should note that it had been initially envisaged that the second phase recommendations on EL and PL would take the form of an addendum to the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and would be published by the end of September.  However, because of the complexity and the legal nature of some of the issues, it became clear that extra time would be required to properly examine the relevant issues in order to come up with effective and achievable recommendations.  Therefore, the Working Group decided that a full 'stand-alone' report will instead be finalised by the end of the year.  This report will follow a similar format to the Motor Report and include an action plan with associated actions and deadlines for implementation.  </p><p>I understand that the drafting phase of the report is nearing completion and that it will be submitted to me for approval by the end of the year, with its subsequent publication in January following approval by Government.</p></reply>

I am advised that it is not possible to estimate the exact number of staff expected to take voluntary redundance in the future as any schemes in 2018 or 2019 will take into account the ongoing business needs of the Agency at that time as determined by the NAMA Board&rsquo;s objectives.</p><p>NAMA has advised that the retention portion of the scheme is being implemented in line with the stipulated parameters, agreed by the previous Minister for Finance and NAMA in March 2015, regarding the quantum of any payment under the scheme, the timing of any such payment and employee eligibility under the scheme.  To be eligible for the retention scheme a NAMA employee must:</p><p>- have been identified by the NAMA Board as essential to achieving NAMA&rsquo;s objectives;</p><p>- be on a specified purpose contract</p><p>- not have a right of return to the NTMA and not be employed by any successor entity of NAMA;</p><p>- have a minimum of two year&rsquo;s employment with NAMA at the time of redundancy;</p><p>- have maintained a &ldquo;fully satisfactory&rdquo; rating or greater for the duration of their employment with NAMA; </p><p>and</p><p>- remain with NAMA as long as required.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that as Minister, I have no role in respect of NAMA's commercial operations or decisions, including determining NAMA's staffing numbers and redundancies, which are internal considerations for the NAMA Chief Executive and Board.</p></reply>

The position of the Government will be made clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT. I consider it very important that the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT i.e., achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer terms, will inform our consideration of this matter.</p>  <p>  I expect the Department of Finance will commence work on this matter in the New Year in conjunction with the Departments of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government and Revenue.</p>  <p>  Dr Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his 2015 report on his review of the Local Property Tax. His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield. This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue. Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%. This new system was recommended by Dr Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p>  <p>  My predecessor subsequently proposed to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019. This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values. The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Doctor Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities.  </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-30a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017113000049#WRA02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 23 together.</p>  <p>  Under the Irish corporate tax regime, losses incurred in the course of a business are allowed to be taken into account in calculating the appropriate amount of tax due by companies.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over a longer period than just a single year and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not allow loss relief in the next.  </p>  <p>  Under the NAMA Act 2009 a new section &ndash; section 396C &ndash; was inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The provision limited the amount of prior-year losses that a NAMA participating institution could offset against trading profits to 50% of trading profit for each accounting period.  It should be noted that it did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used.   </p>  <p>  Reintroducing the previous restriction would mean the period of utilisation for the bank would be extended over a considerably longer timeframe. This would increase the likelihood that the bank&rsquo;s auditors would seek a write down of the deferred tax assets, thereby reducing shareholders&rsquo; funds in the banks&rsquo; financial statements and its capital ratios.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately it is not possible to estimate a precise value of this accounting write down, as it would be done on a bank-by-bank basis in agreement with the individual bank&rsquo;s auditors. For the same reason we cannot estimate what the impact would be to capital ratios.</p>  <p>  What we can estimate, however, is what the deferred tax asset represents as a percentage of each bank&rsquo;s transitional core equity tier 1 ratio, as at 30 June 2017, before any such policy change.  For AIB it represents 3.7 percentage points of its ratio of 19.9%, for Bank of Ireland it represents 1.7 percentage points of 14.4%, and for PTSB it represents 2.3 percentage points of 17.1%.</p>  <p>  If some or most of this benefit was removed from each bank&rsquo;s capital ratio, I cannot say what the reaction would be from the regulator. That is a matter for the Single Supervisory Mechanism and it might vary by bank.  However at a minimum it might impact the quantum of dividends the State would expect to receive from these banks in the near term.</p>  <p>  Rather than interfere with the deferred tax assets by changing tax policy, the Government has ensured a contribution from the sector by introducing a bank levy, payable since 2014, of approximately &euro;150 million per annum.  </p></reply>

However, the base for USC does not include payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including the State pension.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in 2011 and the issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.  In retirement, therefore, they receive an occupational pension only, and do not receive a separate State Pension unless as a result of PRSI contributions made in another employment during their working life.</p>  <p>  It was decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as an exemption would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it could involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.  However, as a result of the review of the USC, in Budget 2012 the entry threshold to USC was increased from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum, and the threshold was subsequently increased further in Budgets 2015 and 2016, to the current threshold of &euro;13,000.  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to continue the process of reducing the personal tax burden, with a particular focus on low and middle-income earners, subject to having the required fiscal space. Budget 2018 has continued the progress made in the three previous Budgets in reducing rates of USC at lower income levels.  The combined effect of Budgets 2015 to 2018 will see a reduction in the three lowest rates of USC from 2%, 4% and 7% to 0.5%, 2% and 4.75% respectively. </p>  <p>  I have also stated on a number of occasions, including the recent Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that my long term view of the USC is to see its amalgamation with the existing PRSI system. This is a complex undertaking that will take time to plan and implement, and will require further consideration of all the distinct features of the USC and PRSI systems, including the taxation of pre-95 public servants. A working group will be established after the passage of the Finance Bill to examine and decide on the best method for the full amalgamation of USC and PRSI and it will consist of officials from all relevant Departments and agencies and others as appropriate. The amalgamation of these charges will help to ensure that vital public services will be well-funded into the future, as well as supporting the improvement of our social insurance system, for the benefit of all our citizens.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This follows annual growth of 5.2 per cent in the first quarter. </p><p>As part of Budget 2018, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 4.3 per cent for this year and 3.5 per cent for next year, with growth averaging close to 3 per cent in the following years.</p><p>The recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market. Employment increased at an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017, representing the creation of over 48,000 additional jobs over the year. Since the low-point in 2012 there are now an additional 230,000 people in employment. </p><p>The continued growth in employment has seen the unemployment rate fall from over 15 per cent in 2012 to 6.0 per cent in October 2017 which is close to the level considered to represent full employment in Ireland. </p><p>The strong performance of the labour market is set to continue in the short term. As part of Budget 2018, my Department is projecting that an additional 48,000 jobs will be created next year. Strong employment growth is expected to further reduce the unemployment rate, to around 5 &frac12; per cent by the end of next year.</p><p>Other indicators including retail sales, purchasing managers&rsquo; indices and consumer sentiment all point to continued growth in the economy.</p><p>However, there are a number of risks at present including the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU and the possibility of significant tax reform in the US. In addition, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling rate is posing significant challenges, particularly for the traditional sector, tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade. </p><p>These sources of uncertainty highlight the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p><p>In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain stable although the level of uncertainty at present remains elevated. It is therefore critical that appropriate polices are implemented and that is what the Government will continue to do.</p></reply>

The SBCI achieves this aim through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk sharing activities. </p>  <p>  The SBCI began lending in March 2015. To the end of June 2017, &euro;855 million of SBCI funding has been provided to 21,132 Irish SMEs, supporting 106,728 jobs. It is encouraging to note that represents an increase of 57% in SBCI lending since the end of December 2016. The interest rate on SBCI loans is 1.15% lower than the average market interest rate on loans to SMEs and 85% of SBCI loans are to SMES based outside of Dublin. As the Deputy will appreciate, the SBCI&rsquo;s lending is driven by market demands as well as needs that are not fully met by the private sector.</p>  <p>  The SBCI has &euro;1 billion of funding available from KfW, the EIB, the NTMA and the Council of Europe Development Bank, as well as a loan facility of &euro;215 million available from ISIF. To date, &euro;881 million of this funding has been committed to the SBCI&rsquo;s seven on-lenders.</p>  <p>  The SBCI is focusing on developing a diverse range of on-lenders, currently four of its on-lenders are non-bank finance providers. The SBCI has an independent board and risk management committee responsible for making the decision to enter in to an on-lending agreement. The SBCI's on-lender criteria are designed to mitigate risks to Irish taxpayers and European funding and to SME borrowers. They aim to ensure that all lending partners have the necessary financial strength and capability to provide the required level of service to SMEs alongside sufficient protections for the taxpayer. This requires both a robust due diligence process and a careful structuring of its lending facilities. </p>  <p>  The SBCI is also working to develop more innovative products, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme. The Deputy can rest assured that the SBCI is supporting the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to SMEs and improving finance providers&rsquo; willingness to lend to SMEs.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years and this phenomenon was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016. Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  </p>  <p>  The third such update was published on 23 October 2017 and shows that 32 actions were due for completion in the first three quarters of the year in total and 29 of those actions have been completed to date.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Of the three actions which have not been fully completed to date, two of them relate to the same recommendation, which requires the approval of the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner for potentially far-reaching cooperative mechanisms between Insurance Ireland and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be formalised.  The other outstanding action is contingent on the establishment of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, now scheduled for 2018.</p>  <p>  The fourth quarterly update should be published early in the New Year and will focus on the 14 actions which are due for completion in the third quarter of 2017. All of the remaining actions are scheduled to be completed before the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for October) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 15.2% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that for the majority of drivers their premiums should continue to fall from last year's levels.</p></reply>

Given both high levels of economic growth in Ireland in recent years, when compared with that of other Member States, our overall share of contributions to the EU budget has grown significantly and Ireland became a net contributor to the EU budget for the first time in 2014. We forecast this trend to continue in the coming years. </p>  <p>  My Department currently forecasts that Ireland's contribution to the EU budget will be &euro;2,020 million in 2017, &euro;2,650 million in 2018, &euro;2,675 million in 2019 and &euro;2,750 million in 2020. It is worth noting that these forecasts are contingent on a number of variables,  including the size of the overall EU budget for the year and other EU budget operational developments which will only emerge as the year progresses. As a result all forecasts will be monitored and updated on an ongoing basis as new information becomes available. These updates also allow for updated GNI forecasts as they become available.</p>  <p>  The Commission is due to present a proposal on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (post 2020) by mid-2018. While my Department currently forecasts Ireland's contributions to the EU budget for 2021 to be &euro;2,775 million, this figure is used primarily for illustrative purposes.</p></reply>

These measures included, amongst others, the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board &ndash; ReBo and the availability of &euro;250 million of exchequer funding for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo. </p>  <p>ReBo was established on a statutory basis on 1st   January 2013 pursuant to section 42 of the 2012 Act to facilitate and oversee restructuring of the sector. The 2012 Act provides that when the Minister for Finance is satisfied that ReBo has completed the performance of its functions under Part 3 of the Act, the Minister may by order dissolve ReBo. Prior to dissolving ReBo, section 43(2) requires that the Minister conducts a review of the operation of Part 3 of the Act, to determine whether or not ReBo has, in the Minister's opinion, completed the performance of its functions. A review of the operation of Part 3 of the Act was carried out by me in June 2017 which determined that ReBo had completed the performance of its functions. This review was published on the Department website. My Department has prepared draft Heads of a Bill for the dissolution of ReBo which will be brought to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  During its 4 year lifetime, ReBo has overseen and facilitated 82 restructuring projects involving 156 credit unions with assets totalling circa &euro;6bn, across 24 counties. These newly merged credit unions are now bigger and stronger entities who will be better positioned to harness the efficiencies of their increased scale to prudently develop the products and services that their members are looking for now and into the future.  Further restructuring projects have recently taken place without the support of ReBo, which has completed the performance of its functions.      </p>  <p>  The Government wants not only strong, vibrant credit unions offering a safe and secure place for members' savings but also credit unions' being appropriately positioned to offer their members a wide range of services including loans, debit card facilities and new facilities based on the needs of their membership. This Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in Ireland and the Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.  </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  </p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment on individual cases, I have been advised by the OPW that information on the Tolka  (East Wall Scheme), the Tolka  (Hawthorne Terrace Scheme) , and the Tolka (Richmond Road Scheme) which are all located in Dublin 3, and built to the 1/100 year standard, has been shared with Insurance Ireland under the Memorandum of Understanding mentioned above.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not have any schemes underway in Dublin 1, however Dublin City Council has carried out a number of flood alleviation works. In particular, the Tolka Flood Alleviation Project was finished in 2008, from St. Mobhi Road to Annesley Bridge, with a small amount of quay wall strengthening on East Wall Road; the Spencer Dock / Royal Canal tidal lock gates were completed in 2009.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be pleased to learn that a number of actions have already been implemented and the others are in progress for implementation within their deadlines.</p><p>My Department, in consultation with the Central Bank, has transposed MiFID II into Irish law via SI 375/2017. A MiFID II Bill providing for criminal sanctions for certain serious infringements of the MiFID II framework is expected to be enacted in Q1 2018.</p><p>Ireland has implemented the Common Reporting Standard which provides for the automatic exchange of financial account information between tax authorities.  The first information exchange began in September 2017. Ireland was one of only 3 countries to receive the top rating from the Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information for being fully Compliant with international standards on tax transparency and exchange of information. The Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with my Department, continue to monitor whether any additional powers or resources are currently required. Any such measures will then be proposed to me as Minister for Finance for appropriate action. Funding allocated to Revenue in Budget 2018 will support them in undertaking a number of initiatives, including: </p><p>- Significant reform of the administration of the PAYE system; and,</p><p>- The enhancement of ICT systems capacity for data matching and data analytics.</p><p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Report on Ireland&rsquo;s Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) was published on 7<sup>th</sup>September, and found that overall, Ireland has a sound and substantially effective regime to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing. The review made a series of detailed recommendations in regard to all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s AML/CFT regime. An action plan to address those recommendations has been drafted and is expected to be agreed before year end. The action plan transposes all of the recommendations arising from Ireland&rsquo;s FATF review, and sets out to deliver improvements in the AML/CFT measures in place in Ireland between now and our 5<sup>th</sup>year FATF Follow-up Assessment. </p><p>Article 30 of the 4<sup>th</sup>Anti-Money-Laundering Directive requires that Member States hold in a central register, information on the beneficial ownership of corporate and other legal entities incorporated within their territories. It also requires that Member States hold adequate, up-to-date information regarding the beneficial ownership of any express trust governed under its law. My Department is currently transposing these provisions by way of Statutory Instruments. This work is well advanced and the transposition is expected to be concluded shortly.</p><p>Finally, in relation to the Progress Report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, my officials are working to finalise the report and I expect to publish this before Christmas. The progress report will illustrate the wholesale change in the regulatory culture since the financial crisis, characterised by a more intrusive supervisory approach by the Central Bank. Recent events have shown it is now time for a similar sea change within the Irish retail banking sector, and are a reminder that we cannot be complacent but must continuously strive to improve governance and practice wherever there are failings. </p></reply>

While the NCT is one component of having safer vehicles on our roads, every vehicle owner has a personal and legal responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy and well maintained.  The NCT is an inspection or general &ldquo;health check&rdquo; of what is visible and accessible on the day of the test and includes a check of the roadworthiness of such safety features, amongst others, as lighting, brakes and tyres.  It is important to understand that the NCT is a minimum requirement of roadworthiness and that insurers will generally require that a car has a valid NCT in order to be covered.  However, in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, this is not the only rating factor taken into account in the provision of motor insurance, as mentioned in the paragraph above. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth noting that according to the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if he/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  If the Deputy is aware of a driver that is unable to get cover from an insurer on the grounds provided in the question, Insurance Ireland can be contacted in this regard at declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914 or 01-6761820.</p></reply>

Therefore, as you can appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss those negotiations in detail at this point.

In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.</p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted a National Random Sampling Programme in January 2016, with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programme involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new marker was found in any of the samples tested.  The random sampling programme was repeated in January 2017 and, again, no evidence of the marker was found.  This provides very persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has been successful in addressing and significantly curtailing the laundering problem.  </p>  <p>  Action is taken against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and includes a range of measures to identify and target persons engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved.  Revenue&rsquo;s multifaceted strategy encompasses, also, ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, extensive cooperation (including the development and sharing of intelligence) on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and detection technologies and optimising the deployment of resources.</p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue&rsquo;s goal of intercepting the supply of illicit tobacco products. Revenue also target the illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p>  <p>  In addition, and as in the case of fuel, action has been taken through Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the statutory powers necessary for undertaking its important work against the illegal tobacco trade.</p>  <p>  In terms of assessing the overall performance in tackling the illegal tobacco trade, a reliable measure is provided by the annual surveys of illegal tobacco products carried out by IPSOS/MRBI for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive. The survey in 2016 found that 10% of cigarette packs encountered in the course of the project were illicit, down from the levels of 15% and 13% found in 2011 and 2012 respectively.</p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel and tobacco fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity. This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up in 2016, within the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office, and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action in these areas will continue to be given high priority. In addition, I assure the Deputy that I will give careful consideration to any further proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue to enhance its capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas. </p></reply>

It advised that they are designed to provide consumers with life cover for their whole life. As long as the policy holder makes regular payments and the payments are sufficient to maintain the chosen benefits, this type of cover will pay a lump sum on the death of the policy holder.</p>  <p>  The regular payment into the plan covers the cost of providing the benefits chosen on the plan. In the early years the payments are higher than the cost of the policy holder&rsquo;s benefits with the extra money paid going into the plan fund. However, protection benefits get more expensive as policy holders get older with the result that payments into the plan begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly, and in order to keep the level of benefits at the current level of payments, the difference is made up from the plan fund. </p>  <p>  In order to see if the consumer&rsquo;s regular payment plus any fund that has been built up is enough to cover their chosen benefits for their reviewable protection plan, an insurance company carries out regular reviews of these plans (the period in which these are completed can be 5 years, 6 years, 10 or 12 years depending on the product). During a review the insurance company may find that the consumer&rsquo;s current level of payments is enough to maintain the level of cover that the consumer wants.  However, the insurance company may also find that the current level of payments is not enough to maintain the level of cover desired by the consumer, thus explaining why a number of people are finding that their premiums are increasing. </p></reply>

My Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, now the Department of Community and Rural Development, are the Departments responsible for fulfilling this commitment. </p>  <p>  Local public banking is where a state, or other public body, has ownership of a financial institution. In Germany, Sparkassen (local public banks) operate in specified regions and their aim is not profit maximisation but rather promoting the interest of the public stakeholder, economic development and financial inclusion. Irish Rural link and SBFIC suggested a similar ethos for Irish local public banks in their proposal. </p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties. It has also included an analysis of a detailed proposal for a possible model of local public baking in Ireland. This proposal was put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group.  There have been a number of meetings between their representatives and my officials. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been working jointly the Department of Community and Rural Development in order to prepare a report of the investigation of local public banking.

To the end of June 2017, &euro;855 million of SBCI funding has been provided to 21,132 Irish SMEs, supporting 106,728 jobs. This represents an increase of 57% in SBCI lending since the end of December 2016. The interest rate on SBCI loans is 1.15% lower than the average market interest rate on loans to SMEs. Of specific relevance to this question is that 85% of SBCI loans are to SMEs based outside of Dublin. </p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s macro-economic forecasts take into account the economic impacts of Brexit. In addition, the Department has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of Brexit-related studies, both before and since the UK's referendum decision, including;</p><p>- 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland' &ndash; Scoping study of scenarios for the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in <b>November 2015</b>;</p><p>- &lsquo;An Exposure Analysis of Sectors of the Irish Economy&rsquo;. An in-depth analysis of the possible sectoral and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published by Department of Finance<b>October 2016</b>(Updated March 2017); </p><p>- 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' - Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in <b>November 2016,</b>which modelled the medium to long term macroeconomic impact of Brexit under a number of scenarios, including a hard Brexit whereby trade between the EU and UK reverts to WTO tariffs, and;</p><p>- &lsquo;Trade Exposures of Sectors of the Irish Economy in a European Context&rsquo; &ndash; An analysis of trade exposure to the UK in comparison to other EU Member States, published by Department of Finance<b>September 2017</b>;</p><p>It is clear from the Department&rsquo;s published research that the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy is significant. The Department of Finance preparations are ongoing and continue to examine all possible scenarios and challenges, and are a key input into the whole of Government approach.</p><p>The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  </p><p>The Government has taken a number of important steps to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs, our Trade and Investment Strategy and the preparation of a  new 10-year Capital Plan. On the fiscal side, the Government has continued its policy focus of enhancing the resilience of our public finances to any Brexit-related shock. Specifically, it is projected that Ireland will achieve its medium-term budgetary objective of a balanced budget next year. Linked to this, over the forecast horizon, it is projected that the General Government Debt-to-GDP ratio will continue on a downward trajectory, reaching the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) 60 per cent threshold in the early part of the next decade and continuing to improve thereafter. Whilst not complacent to potential challenges, including our currently elevated debt level, these developments will help provide fiscal capacity in the event of Brexit.  Complementing this, Budget 2018 further established the &lsquo;Rainy Day Fund&rsquo;, which provides a further counter-cyclical buffer, and represents an important measure to strengthen the shock absorption capacity of the national finances to such external risks. </p><p>Budget 2018 also announced further measures to prepare Ireland&rsquo;s economy for the significant challenges ahead.  These measures include: a doubling of capital investment between 2015 to 2021 - boosting the growth potential of the economy;  improving the competitiveness of our personal tax system - through income tax reform; introducing a Key Employment Engagement Programme (KEEP) &ndash; a new incentive to attract key employees; a new &euro;300 million Loan Guarantee Scheme for Brexit-impacted business and a complementary &euro;25 million Agriculture Brexit Loan Scheme &ndash; targeted at enhancing the competitiveness of the businesses most exposed to Brexit; the retention of the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector to reduce the impact of currency volatility in the wake of the UK&rsquo;s decision; and a doubling of additional Brexit-related staff in state agencies. </p><p>Additionally, the Government&rsquo;s strategy to mitigate the impact of Brexit includes fully exploiting the opportunities arising.  With regard to the Financial Services sector, Brexit will provide opportunities for Ireland to increase its share of financial services based inward investment. In that regard, Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy  for driving growth in the financial services sector. </p><p>The Department of Finance will continue to carry out the necessary research, analysis and consultations, and to develop policy advice in the context of Brexit.</p></reply>

This is based on estimates in Revenue&rsquo;s Pre-Budget Ready Reckoner, which showed the effect of a 0.5% increase in the rate on non-residential property, a &euro;47 million increase in yield &ndash; this is multiplied up to &euro;94 million for 1% increase, or &euro;376 million for a 4% increase. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the yield projection for 2018 is based on receipts for previous years, combined with an ongoing assessment of expected receipts by the end of the current year (2017) and for next year (2018) as well as impacts of earlier policy changes. This process includes assessment of significant once-off transactions that positively increased 2016 receipts but are not expected to reoccur on a regular basis. Failure to account for these once-off transactions would have led to a higher estimate for 2018, therefore the estimate should be considered as conservative and prudent.</p>  <p>  Following Budget 2018, Revenue has updated the Ready Reckoner to a Post-Budget basis, taking account of budgetary changes and revised growth forecasts (from the Department of Finance) for 2018. The Post-Budget Ready Reckoner indicates that each 0.5% increase in the rate of Stamp Duty on non-residential property (from the new rate of 6%) is now estimated to raise &euro;49 million.</p>  <p>  It is expected that total Stamp Duty receipts from non-residential property will be around &euro;600 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  It should be noted the estimates make an assumption of no behavioural change. In the absence of precise and accurate forecasts for transaction volumes in 2018, basing receipts on 2016/2017 levels and trends is the most reasonable option. The estimate also assumes current exemptions and other reliefs remain unchanged.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that adjusting for possible once-off transactions in 2016, receipts in the three year period 2014 to 2016 were quite stable and Revenue's assessment is that it seems reasonable to expect this level of activity is sustainable and for it to continue. </p></reply>

In an earlier response to the Deputy I clearly laid out the measures the Government is taking to address this difference. </p>  <p>  The fundamental issue with the housing market in Ireland today is lack of supply. This applies to the rental market specifically and to the residential property market more generally. To address this, the Government's housing strategy, Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, adopts a whole of government response with 84 actionable measures across five key pillars and aims to increase overall housing supply by 25,000 new homes every year by 2020. The measures set out in the Action Plan aim to stimulate supply by streamlining the planning system, removing infrastructure blockages and supporting the delivery of affordable housing for both first time buyers and purchasers of family homes. This increase in supply should lead to reduced inflationary pressure in both the owner occupier and rental market. </p>  <p>  More recently, the Government has been engaged in a review of Rebuilding Ireland, in order to assess its impact and consider additional actions to address issues with supply in the housing market.  Further to this, in Budget 2018 an additional &euro;500 million was allocated to build an additional 3,000 social housing units by 2021. Furthermore, funding of &euro;750 million from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is being made available to a new vehicle - Home Building Finance Ireland &ndash; to boost the supply of debt funding to residential development.  These measures are intended to increase the supply of both private and social residential properties and thus ease inflationary pressures in the market, which in turn will help to address the difference in wage and rental inflation. </p>  <p>  The Government has also sought to specifically address rent inflation through the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ). These measures have been introduced to address inflation in rental prices within designated areas. There are signs that this measure, as well as government initiatives more broadly, are beginning to have a moderating impact on rental prices. For example, in Dublin the rate of increase in the second quarter of 2017 (5.8 per cent) is at its lowest since the second quarter of 2013. The Government will continue to closely monitor developments in rental sector and the housing market more generally.</p></reply>

Both processes were closely contested with 8 countries in the running for the EBA and 19 for the EMA. The decision on both Agencies came down to the drawing of lots and in the end Paris was confirmed as the new host of the EBA and Amsterdam as the host for the EMA. </p>  <p>  Ireland submitted two credible bids to host either the EMA or the EBA which were regarded by other Member States and the EU Commission, as strong. In addition Ireland was seen as one of the locations that would be least disruptive to the important work of the two agencies and to their staff and families as they relocated.</p>  <p>  Since the Government&rsquo;s declaration of our bid to host the EBA, the officials in my Department have worked intensively to promote Ireland as the location of choice for the EBA. They engaged with relevant stakeholders, including meetings with the EBA and the European Commission, to highlight the benefits of relocating the Authority to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance produced the bid document and the brochure that promoted Dublin as a location for the EBA. These documents were based on criteria put forward by the President of the European Commission and President of the European Council. IDA Ireland assisted on the property dimensions of the bid while a range of other Departments also contributed.</p>  <p>  My officials also collaborated with their colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to coordinate Ireland&rsquo;s offers to host the EBA and the EMA.</p>  <p>  During the process of building support for our EBA we engaged with all Member States. This involved a number of Ministerial visits to capitals including Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy visiting nine Member States in late September. I, along with other Ministers and officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade, also met with counterparts on the margins of meetings held in Europe and elsewhere. Contact was also made through our Embassy network as well as with the relevant foreign embassies in Dublin. </p>  <p>  This was a highly competitive process and to get to the final round was a major achievement and to have it be decided by the drawing of lots was disappointing. However, our strong performance in the process and our engagement has enhanced Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in the EU and it has helped strengthen our ties and relationships across a range of Member States.</p></reply>

NAMA and my Department have co-operated fully with the European Commission throughout their preliminary investigations and have addressed all queries and provided all information requested by DG Comp to date. </p>  <p>  My officials, along with NAMA, have had extensive engagements with the European Commission in relation to the complaint via written submissions, telephone calls and meetings, often in response to specific information requests from the DG Comp Case Team resulting from allegations made by the complainants. I can confirm that neither NAMA nor my Department have communicated with the Complainants directly regarding this complaint as to do so would be inappropriate given the ongoing nature of the investigation.  NAMA and/or Department officials have, on occasion, engaged with some of the Complainants, or their representatives, on other matters unrelated to the complaint over the past number of years.</p>  <p>  I understand the DG Comp Case Team continue to consider all submissions and evidence provided and a preliminary finding has not yet been determined.  The Case Team may seek further information from my Department in the course of their deliberations and my Department and NAMA will of course provide whatever information and assistance is required by the Case Team. Senior Department officials maintain an open dialogue with DG Comp as they progress their work. I do not have a timeframe for a decision on the case, though I understand the Commission's work is well advanced.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, while it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on what is an ongoing DG Comp investigation, I would point out that NAMA lends money to willing NAMA debtors and receivers on commercial arms-length terms only where there is an expectation that such financing will enhance NAMA's recovery of the money owed to NAMA by its debtor.  </p>  <p>  To be clear, NAMA is lending money to existing NAMA debtors to allow the debtor to enhance the value of the collateral securing that debtor's original loan owed to NAMA in order to not only pay back the additional lending with interest but, importantly, to pay back a greater proportion of the total debt owed to NAMA.</p>  <p>  NAMA requires that the projected return resulting from the provision of additional funding must be the value maximising strategy for the asset and this is fully in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  This means NAMA will facilitate the funding of development of only those sites that are commercially viable and where site development will deliver a better recovery than the sale of the undeveloped site.</p>  <p>  In addition, where NAMA provides funding to facilitate development by its debtors or receivers, it is provided at appropriate market rates of interest. The clear intention of NAMA's residential funding initiative is to enhance the returns to NAMA over and above any other viable strategy, provide funding on market terms and ensure there is no impact on competition more generally.</p></reply>

While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to rollover risk related to possible interest rate increases. We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual. Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining sound public finances. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, compliance with the fiscal rules is not only a matter of policy. The fiscal rules to which Ireland is subject to have direct application through a number of EU regulations as well as domestically via the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the Commission's assessments of other EU Member States&rsquo; compliance with the rules; these are regularly discussed at the monthly Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings which I attend on behalf of the Government.  </p>  <p>  The issue of facilitating greater flexibility within the application of the fiscal rules has received significant focus at European level and framed discussions on the establishment of the structural reform and investment clauses, which were codified by the Commission in November 2015. Specifically these provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment, subject to strict conditions.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore there is existing flexibility within the expenditure benchmark whereby public investment increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space. This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that any decision to increase capital expenditure over and above already planned levels would need to balance the danger of potentially over-heating in the economy with the need to address infrastructure priorities and risks such as Brexit.  I will not adopt pro-cyclical budgetary policies that jeopardise our future living standards.</p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, I have no plans to revise policy regarding adherence to the fiscal rules.</p></reply>

However any lending provided in due course will be provided by HBFI which will be fully separate and will not impact NAMA's existing objectives or its Board&rsquo;s strategic wind down plans. The exact staffing and servicing arrangements are currently being devised by my officials and NAMA and will be confirmed in due course.</p>  <p>  I would be hopeful of bringing the establishing legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in early 2018, with a view to HBFI commencing operations later in 2018. It is not expected that HBFI will have an indefinite lifespan but it is too early to speculate on how long it may operate as this will depend on the availability of funding in the market to meet demand for homes in the coming years.</p>  <p>  With a proposed allocation of up to &euro;750m, it is estimated that HBFI could have capacity to fund about 6,000 homes in the coming years. The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, could help reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon). This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the products that will be offered by HBFI, the fund will be designed to focus on the provision of debt funding to viable residential development projects. This funding will mirror the type of lending which NAMA has provided to its debtors in recent years. As the Deputy will be aware, the State is already providing a number of alternative supports into this market, including equity finance, through the ISIF&rsquo;s existing residential development funding platforms.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific product terms and conditions that will attach to this lending, I am not in a position to provide detail at this time. I can confirm that HBFI will be lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions, which would depend on the risk profile of each individual project, the quality of collateral and the creditworthiness of the borrower. The specifics parameters for this will be set by the board of HBFI in due course having regard to the nature of the project and market conditions at that time. </p></reply>

A new 10-year Capital Plan is also in preparation.</p>  <p>  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In that context, on the fiscal side, the Government has continued its policy focus of enhancing the resilience of our public finances to any Brexit-related shock. Specifically, it is projected that Ireland will achieve its medium-term budgetary objective of a balanced budget next year. Linked to this, over the forecast horizon, it is projected that the General Government Debt-to-GDP ratio will continue on a downward trajectory, reaching the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) 60 per cent threshold in the early part of the next decade and continuing to improve thereafter. Whilst not complacent to potential challenges, including our currently elevated debt level, these developments will help provide fiscal capacity in the event of Brexit.  Complementing this, Budget 2018 further established the &lsquo;Rainy Day Fund&rsquo;, which provides an additional counter-cyclical buffer, and represents an important measure to strengthen the shock absorption capacity of the national finances to such external risks. </p>  <p>  As part of its contingency planning, the Department is engaged on an ongoing basis in examining the potential impacts of Brexit on the financial services sector and potential mitigations.  As part of this work the Department liaises with other Government Departments and Agencies who have responsibilities in this area, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The Department also engages closely, via the Financial Stability Group with the Central Bank of Ireland, which has the statutory responsibility for financial stability.  Brexit is a standing item on the Group&rsquo;s agenda. In undertaking its statutory role, the Central Bank continues to engage with financial firms to ensure that appropriate contingency measures are in place to address issues relating to Brexit and to set out the responsibility on firms to take preparatory actions in advance of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government&rsquo;s strategy to mitigate the impact of Brexit includes fully exploiting opportunities arising.  With regard to the Financial Services sector, Brexit will provide opportunities for Ireland to increase its share of financial services based inward investment. In that regard, Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector.</p></reply>

This follows annual growth of 5.2 per cent in the first quarter. </p>  <p>  Growth is broad based with both underlying domestic demand &ndash; stripping out the volatile components of investment &ndash; and net exports contributing positively to growth this year.</p>  <p>  The strength of underlying domestic demand is being felt in the labour market. Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.4 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2017, representing the creation of over 48,000 additional jobs over the year. The increase in employment remains broad based with gains recorded in 11 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO. Since the low-point in 2012 there are now an additional 230,000 people in employment. </p>  <p>  Recent data published indicate that:</p>  <p>  - The volume of retail sales increased by 4.5 per cent year-on-year in October 2017. Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up by 6.0 per cent over the same period. </p>  <p>  - Expansion in the construction  sector continued in October with the Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index for the sector  recording its fiftieth successive month of expansion. </p>  <p>  - The Consumer Sentiment Index was 104.8 in October, well above its long run average. </p>  <p>  - The seasonally-adjusted monthly  unemployment rate for October was 6.0 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in  October 2015.  As a result, the  unemployment rate has fallen by more than half since its peak of over 15 per cent in early-2012.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2018, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent next year, following growth of 4.3 per cent this year. The strong performance of the labour market is set to continue in the short term, my Department is projecting that an additional 48,000 jobs will be created next year. Strong employment growth is expected to further reduce the unemployment rate, to around 5 &frac12; per cent by the end of next year.</p>  <p>  However, there are a number of risks at present, principally the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU. In addition, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling rate is posing significant challenges, particularly for the traditional sector, tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade. Notwithstanding the magnitude of these challenges, the main macroeconomic impact of the appreciation of the euro-sterling rate so far has been on the nominal side of the economy, with inflation remaining subdued despite a pick-up in the rest of the euro area. In particular, export growth has held up well despite the appreciation of the euro. Importantly, the largely indigenous food and beverage sector, for which the UK is an important export market, has proven resilient this year with the value of exports up 13.5 per cent in the first three quarters of 2017 on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency as the full impact of Brexit is only expected to materialise over time. The Government has already taken important steps to prepare the economy, including in Budget 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, and our Trade and Investment Strategy. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has also been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness. The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 20 per cent between its peak in 2008 and October 2017. However, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling bilateral rate is a reminder that forces beyond our control can turn against us. This is all the more reason why we must focus on the costs which we can influence.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it is important that the public finances are managed in a prudent manner and that competitiveness-oriented policies are pursued so that the Irish economy is in the best possible position to weather economic shocks that may emerge.</p>  <p>  In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain positive.  However, the full impact of the UK&rsquo;s decision is yet to be seen. I am also conscious that the level of uncertainty is elevated at present. In this regard, it is critical that appropriate polices are implemented and that is what the Government will continue to do.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-30a.168.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017113000051#WRC03500"><p>The Central Bank has informed me that it does not have a statutory role to prescribe the rates that mortgage lenders charge on their loans. </p><p>A healthy commercial banking system that is in a position to provide finance to customers and is resilient to economic and financial market shocks, needs to be able to generate sustainable profits over the long term &ndash; for example, sufficient profit levels to absorb credit losses over the credit cycle while still generating capital.  In Ireland, the mis-pricing of risks in historical lending continues to be a significant contributor to weak profitability, as evidenced by the continued high level of non-performing loans, prevalence of very low yielding tracker mortgages, and low net interest margins.</p><p>Furthermore, the residential mortgage market comprises, inter alia, fixed interest rate, loan to value managed variable rate mortgages, trackers, restructured mortgages of various types, etc.  Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed by only looking at standard variable rate mortgages, and any assessment would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing.</p><p>The legacy issues, together with other input costs to variable rate mortgage pricing were outlined in a paper provided by the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance in May 2015.  These include higher costs from credit losses, higher funding costs, higher levels of capital resulting from regulatory changes, higher required capital per euro risk given the severe loss experience in the crisis, higher operating costs per euro of loans given falling balance sheets and the fixed costs base that comes with the infrastructure requirements of large retail banks.</p><p>The Central Bank requires that all mortgages are advertised and sold in accordance with the requirements of financial services legislation (including Central Bank Codes), and that consumers who choose a given mortgage product (or to switch to a new product) are treated in accordance with these requirements in the context of the product they have chosen. </p><p>Additionally, the Central Bank has carried out research which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has launched a mortgage switching tool for consumers (which itself notes the findings of the Central Bank research of cases where borrowers could make savings). </p><p>The Central Bank releases monthly retail interest rate data (Tables B1.1 - B2.1). These statistics satisfy reporting requirements as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1072/2013 of 24 September 2013 (ECB/2013/34)1 as amended by Regulation of the ECB of 8 July 2014 (ECB/2014/30), concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to deposits and loans vis-&agrave;-vis households and non-financial corporations. The most recent statistics are available on .</p><p>In addition, following a public consultation process, on 21 July 2016, the Central Bank announced the introduction of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and became effective on 1 February 2017, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p><p>In late 2016, the Central Bank commissioned research into consumer perceptions and attitudes to mortgage switching, as well as the experience of those who had switched. The Central Bank conducted the research to help identify areas where further action by the Central Bank could assist borrowers who are considering switching their mortgage. The Central Bank . The report contained several positive findings from consumers who had switched their mortgage. However, it also highlighted the need for greater transparency for consumers, both about the potential savings they could make by switching and the switching process itself.</p><p>In August 2017, the Central Bank  published a proposing new measures which would enhance the framework of protections for mortgage holders. In that consultation the Central Bank proposed new measures to require lenders to: </p><p>- inform consumers about other available mortgage options that could save them money and about the impact of mortgage-related incentives; </p><p>- help consumers to compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options; </p><p>- provide consumers with standardised switching information; and </p><p>- follow a time-bound switching process.</p><p>The consultation period has now ended, and the Central Bank is analysing the responses it received and is considering next steps.  </p></reply>

Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs. </p><p>In terms of monitoring the working capital requirements for SMEs, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period October 2016 to March 2017, which can be found at . </p><p>The results of this survey show that, when pending applications are excluded, 88% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved. Working capital/cash flow requirements are provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 31% stating this is why they requested bank finance. Expansion requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 23% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose. When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 78% of working capital coming from this source (up 5%). The survey also showed that the number of businesses reporting a profit has increased for the fourth year in a row, and a higher proportion of SMEs than ever are pursuing a growth strategy.  </p><p>A key objective of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources. The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders. The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and four non-bank on-lending partners. To date the SBCI has supported over 21,000 SMEs lending a total of &euro;855 million.</p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people. </p><p>The Credit Review Office is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Review Office overturns more than 50% of lenders decisions in the appeals it receives.  </p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth. I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

The appeals procedure must inform the borrower of his/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman. </p><p>Provision 56 of the CCMA provides that a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence where the lender has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating and notified in accordance with the CCMA.  </p><p>In June 2015, the Central Bank published the outcome of a themed inspection of lenders&rsquo; compliance with the CCMA.  This is available on the Central Banks website - </p><p>.</p><p>The arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.  The Code requires that regulated entities have in place written procedures for the handling of arrears. </p><p>Where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears.  Specified information in relation to arrears must be made available to personal consumers, including general information to encourage the consumer to deal with arrears and stating the benefits of dealing with arrears.  Where an account remains in arrears for 31 calendar days after the arrears first arose, a regulated entity must, inter alia, inform the consumer of the status of the account and the importance of the personal consumer engaging with the regulated entity in order to address the arrears.  This must be updated every three months, where the arrears persist. </p><p>In respect of a mortgage, the Code provides that where a third full or partial repayment is missed and remains outstanding and alternative repayment arrangement has not been put in place, a lender must notify the personal consumer of the potential for legal proceedings and proceedings for repossession of the property, together with an estimate of the costs to the personal consumer of such proceedings.  The lender must notify the personal consumer of the importance of seeking independent advice and that, irrespective of how the property is repossessed and disposed of, the personal consumer will remain liable for the outstanding debt, including accrued interest, charges, legal, selling and other related costs, if this is the case.</p><p>The Code also requires that a lender must ensure that the level of contact and communications with a personal consumer in arrears is proportionate and not excessive.  Each calendar month, a lender must not initiate more than three unsolicited communications, by whatever means, to a personal consumer in respect of arrears.</p><p>In December 2015, the Central Bank published new regulations for firms lending to small and medium enterprises (SME Regulations), with which regulated lenders (other than credit unions) have been required to comply with since 1 July 2016, and in the case of credit unions, from 1 January 2017.  </p><p>The SME Regulations aim to strengthen protections for SMEs when borrowing from regulated lenders while also facilitating access to credit.  They also set out a framework which regulated entities must comply with when dealing with SME borrowers in arrears and financial difficulties.  The SME Regulations require regulated entities to establish and maintain in writing policies and procedures for dealing with borrowers in financial difficulties.  Regulated entities must make available to borrowers an information booklet, to include:</p><p>- a statement emphasising that it is in the borrower&rsquo;s interest to engage with the regulated entity about arrears or financial difficulties;</p><p>- a statement that the financial difficulties may impact on the borrower&rsquo;s credit rating;</p><p>- the option of an immediate review of the borrower&rsquo;s credit facilities.</p><p>Within 10 working days of a borrower entering financial difficulties, a regulated entity must inform the borrower of, among other things: </p><p>- the status of the account;</p><p>- the applicability of the SME Regulations;</p><p>- the availability of the information booklet referred to above; and</p><p>- that it is in the borrower&rsquo;s interest to engage with the regulated entity about arrears or financial difficulties</p><p>Where a regulated entity offers an alternative arrangement to an SME borrower, the regulated entity must provide certain information in writing to the borrower including how the alternative arrangement will be reported by the regulated entity to a relevant credit reference agency or credit register and that it may impact on the borrower&rsquo;s credit rating. </p><p>When contacting borrowers that are micro and small enterprises in financial difficulties, a lender must ensure that the level of contact and communications with the borrower is proportionate and not excessive, taking into account the particular circumstances of the borrower, and that communications with the borrower are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing.  </p><p>My Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed. In addition, the Department of Finance expect that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.</p></reply>

The UK has issued a waiver of its rights to proportionate early repayment.</p>  <p>  I greatly appreciate the cooperation of our Programme partners in facilitating this early repayment. The interest savings to the Exchequer from these early repayments are estimated to be of the order of &euro;150m over the remaining life of the loans. This puts Ireland in a strong financial position for the future and ensures we are making further sustainable progress in reducing our national debt.</p></reply>

The data on numbers availing of SARP are compiled on a year-by-year basis. Data on the duration each claimant has been claiming for is not readily available, nor is it possible to estimate the number of claimants who would continue to claim relief beyond five years should SARP be extended, therefore it is not possible to estimate a cost to the Exchequer for this proposal.</p><p>In relation to the cost of reducing the limits, Revenue further advises me that, without taking account of the potential new employees that may qualify for the scheme as a result of the reduced limits, it tentatively estimates that the first and full year cost of the measures outlined by the deputy are as outlined in the table below.<table><tr><th>Proposed Limit (&euro;)</th><th>First Year Cost (&euro;   millions)</th><th>Full Year Cost (&euro;   millions)</th></tr><tr><td>60,000</td><td>1.06</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>50,000</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>40,000</td><td>2.4</td><td>2.5</td></tr></table></p><p>SARP is aimed at reducing the cost to employers of assigning key individuals already employed by their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of the employer. The intention is that the recipients of SARP will assist with the establishment of additional functions for their companies in Ireland and, due to a transfer of skills, these functions will be able to operate without the assistance of SARP after a period. The existing SARP scheme is limited to existing overseas employees of companies and is not available to newly-recruited individuals. </p><p>As part of the SARP review in 2014, the proposal to include non-resident recruits rather than restricting it to employees moving within an organisation was considered. However, the review found that to apply the scheme to such hirees could result in individuals from outside the state being cheaper to employ than Irish residents, thereby resulting in the potential displacement of employment for Irish residents in favour of non-resident job-seekers.</p></reply>

On the assumption that there may be no growth in investment in products liable to LAET over the longer time period and no behavioural change, a reduction from 41 percent to 33 percent could cost in the order of &euro;44 million. If all investment type products which are taxed at a similar rate were also to be reduced from 41 percent to 33 percent, the likely cost including any reduction in the rate applied to LAET could be in the region of &euro;56 million.</p>  <p>  The final cost of any possible change is likely to be determined by the change in the level of investment in products subject to LAET. Clearly if the level of investment were to be lower, the cost of a reduction in the rate charged would also be lower, and the reverse is equally true. It is worth noting in that context that to date in 2017 the level of LAET receipts compared to those forecasted is lower by some 23 percent, and this is not expected to change significantly in December. </p>  <p>  As I announced during Report State of Finance Bill 2017, in the course of work on this summer&rsquo;s TSG paper on DIRT and Exit Tax, and following advice from Revenue, it has become evident that there are more complex issues to be addressed in the context of the tax regimes which apply to investment products that are not covered by DIRT, than simply the degree of the rates of tax applied, and that a more holistic approach might be required in the context of addressing opposition calls for study on the re-establishment of the informal link between DIRT and LAET.</p>  <p>  I therefore informed that D&aacute;il that I proposes to establish a working group comprising officials from my Department and from Revenue to examine and address the variety and complexity of the existing regimes, including the interaction of those regimes. When announcing this working group, I specified that its work will encompass an examination of the divergence between the rate of DIRT and the rate of LAET, including the impact of that divergence of life assurance savers.</p>  <p>  I also noted that the group will consult with the relevant industry bodies, and will carry out a public consultation on the issues within its remit by written submission.</p>  <p>  I will instruct the group to present me with coordinated formal proposals in advance of Budget 2019, allowing sufficient time for those proposals to be acted on if necessary. </p></reply>

Fiscal space represents the additional capacity arising from the permitted expenditure growth rate that is available for expenditure increases and/or tax reductions.  Fiscal space may be increased through the introduction of discretionary revenue measures that increase revenue and conversely it is reduced by discretionary revenue measures that lower revenue.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government committed in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Confidence and Supply Agreement and Budget 2017 to retain Mortgage Interest Relief (MIR) beyond 2017 on a tapered basis.  Accordingly, Budget 2018 included its retention for principal private residences for a further three years on a tapered basis through the continuation of 75 per cent of the existing relief in 2018, 50 per cent in 2019 and 25 per cent in 2020.   </p>  <p>  As the specific form and length of the tapering was only decided in the context of Budget 2018, pre-Budget 2018 tax forecasts include the costs of the scheme on an unchanged basis.   This means that the tapering of MIR results in a revenue yield to the Exchequer that represents a positive discretionary revenue measure.  It incrementally increases fiscal space by an estimated &euro;51 million in 2018, &euro;46 million in 2019, &euro;41 million in 2020 and &euro;37 million in 2021.        </p>  <p>  With regard to Local Property Tax (LPT), the revaluation date has been postponed to 2019.  The position in 2019 and beyond is a matter for consideration by Government in the coming year.  In that context, my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners will consider issues relating to the implementation of the recommendations in the Report prepared by Dr Don Thornhill.  The Government will make its position clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT. In that regard, the forecast for LPT as set out in Budget 2018 of &euro;470 million for 2017 remains unchanged over the forecast horizon.    </p>  <p>  As a result, there are no discretionary revenue measures relating to LPT in 2018 and no assumptions can be made in this regard for 2019 and subsequent years until the policy process described above is completed.  Accordingly, LPT has no impact on the forecasts of fiscal space out to 2021.    </p></reply>

Retail Credit Firms are authorised to provide credit, in the form of cash loans, directly to individuals (these firms are not licensed to accept deposits).  Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders.  Retail Credit Firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008.  A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website at the following link:</p><p>.  </p><p>In light of their activities, Retail Credit Firms are not subject to the same prudential supervisory regime as licensed credit institutions but are subject to the same Consumer Protection framework requirements including the Central Bank&rsquo;s statutory Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (&lsquo;CCMA&rsquo;).  </p><p>The sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including Retail Credit Firms, dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan which is secured by their  primary residence (as defined).  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.</p><p>The Central Bank engages with Retail Credit Firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), as provided for in the CCMA.

This provided an important opportunity to take stock of progress in light of the forthcoming decision by the European Council in December on whether or not sufficient progress has been made on the exit issues in order to enable discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship and transitional arrangements to begin.    In this regard, Mr Barnier reported that, while some progress was made in the latest round of negotiations on 9-10 November, there is a lot of work remaining in order to achieve sufficient progress across all of the exit issues - citizens&rsquo; rights, the UK&rsquo;s financial settlement and the issues unique to Ireland.</p>  <p>  During the meeting, I took the opportunity to express Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work of Michel Barnier and his team. I also acknowledged the continuing solidarity and support we are enjoying from our EU partners in relation to the Irish specific issues, which was again in evidence throughout the meeting on 20 November. </p>  <p>  I emphasised that the decision on whether or not sufficient progress has been made across all three exit issues is one that the EU27 will take together, on the basis of a recommendation from Mr Barnier. </p>  <p>  As concerns the Irish specific issues, I underlined that the negotiations have reached the point where firm, explicit commitments are required from the UK, which will need to be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement. The achievement of sufficient progress does not mean that all issues need to be definitively settled and the detail worked out.  But what is essential is that the path to the final outcome is mapped out. </p>  <p>  This includes protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  In this regard, I recalled that Ireland continues to believe that the optimal solution would be for the UK to remain in the Customs Union and the Single Market.  But this is ultimately a decision for the UK Government to make.  If the UK continues to rule out this option, the solutions that it offers must be concrete and workable. This should include an acceptance by the UK that the risks posed by the emergence on the island of Ireland of regulatory divergence from the rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union must be avoided. </p>  <p>  I also met with Mr Barnier on 24 November, while attending the Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels, where we spoke in more depth on the Irish specific issues. I thanked Mr Barnier and his team for their hard work and the progress made on the Irish-specific issues. We shared the importance of making sufficient progress on all aspects of the Irish specific issues before a decision can be taken to move to phase 2. I welcomed that there has been particular progress on advancing joint principles on the continuation of the Common Travel Area and that officials have also been carrying out detailed work over the last few weeks to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on or are supported by EU law and policies.  I noted, however, that there is still more work to be done in this area as well as on the question of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland where there must be a commitment from the UK that the risks presented by the emergence of regulatory divergence from the rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union must be avoided. </p>  <p>   I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to continue working closely with the Commission Task Force to advance these issues and our hope that, with hard work and political will, the European Council will be able to take a positive decision next month.</p></reply>

These complaints were raised with the Manager of the centre and she has advised that, as is normal in any premises where food is being prepared under Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)conditions, there is a pest control system in place provided by a pest control company for health and safety reasons. As a result, there are bait boxes strategically placed around the Centre as preventative measures. </p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of night time security, the front door of the building is locked every night at 10pm for the safety of all residents. There is a night porter working at reception which is located beside the front door. The only time he leaves the front desk is to patrol the building to ensure that every area is safe. There is a CCTV system covering public access and common areas installed in the accommodation Centre. This allows the night porter to monitor any person trying to gain access to the centre.</p>  <p>  While there have been no complaints received by my Department in relation to the cleanliness of the bathrooms or hygiene standards in the kitchen, the Centre's Manager has confirmed that the bathrooms are cleaned on at least a daily basis and are inspected regularly throughout the day. It is a condition of all contracts for accommodation centres for those in the protection process that a food management system incorporating the principles of HACCP is in place. This is in accordance with the European Community (Hygiene of Foodstuff) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 165 of 2000). </p>  <p>  In addition to regular inspections carried out by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), as well as an independent inspection service, all accommodation centres are subject to unannounced inspections by state bodies such as Environmental Health Officers and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The Centre was inspected by staff from the Reception and Integration Agency on 25 May 2017 and no issues were identified. Inspection Reports are available to view on www.ria-inspections.gov.ie. In addition, regular clinics are held by RIA staff at accommodation centres. A clinic was held at this centre on the 2 October 2017 and again, none of the issues outlined in the Deputy's question were raised by residents.</p>  <p>  All persons under 18 years of age in accommodation centres under contract to the Department are in the company of their parents or guardians. Unaccompanied minors are the statutory responsibility of TUSLA. TUSLA provide advice to the Department as to whether a person is a minor or otherwise and appropriate accommodation is then provided by either my Department or TUSLA as the case may be.</p></reply>

This raised a number of factual, legal and practical issue in relation to his analysis of the operation of the scheme and to some of his recommendations arising therefrom. </p><p>In this latter respect, during the course of his investigation, the Department was of the view that the inclusion in the scheme of those applicants whom the Ombudsman believes are wrongly excluded would require either the extension of the scheme as approved by Government, or indeed the creation of a new scheme. </p><p>One of the Ombudsman's recommendations concerns the development of robust guidelines on the operation of future restorative or redress schemes. This recommendation, which was not directed solely to my Department, was accepted by the Department in its response to his draft report. In this respect, the Ombudsman's recommendation replicates a similar recommendation by the Comptroller and Auditor General in December 2016 in his Special Report no. 96 on the cost of the Commission on Child Abuse, which led to the Ryan Report, and to the consequent Residential Institutions Redress Scheme which are under the auspices of the Minister for Education and Skills. That report is available on the C&amp;amp;AG website .</p><p>Now that the Ombudsman, having taken into account the Department's views, has issued his final report, the Department will give full and careful consideration to all his recommendations contained therein. </p><p>It is important to record here that to date 684 applicants to the Magdalen scheme have received their ex-gratia payments from the Vote of the Department of Justice and Equality at a cost of &euro;25.7m.  The terms of the scheme recommended by Justice Quirke included the payment of &ldquo;lump&rdquo; sums from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000, special access to health care, upgrading of pension entitlements to the full State Pension for those who had reached retirement age and payment of a weekly sum of &euro;100 inclusive of other State payments to others. </p><p>The Scheme remains open to new applications.  </p></reply>

We are agreed that it is crucial that a deliberate and considered recruitment process takes place so that the best possible candidate is appointed following a selection process. We are also agreed that an overly long delay in the appointment of a new Commissioner would not be optimal for the organisation in terms of performance and morale.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated the Authority commenced the groundwork for the recruitment process some time ago in advance of the formal triggering of the statutory process by Government. I am advised that the Authority has undertaken some research into aspects of the appointment and I expect to hear from the Authority shortly in relation to its views. This preparatory phase has facilitated the Authority in engaging with my Department and with the Public Appointments Service, which will undertake the competition on behalf of the Authority, in relation to the process. Importantly, it has also allowed the Authority to explore with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland how it sees the future role and responsibilities of the new Commissioner. As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission is undertaking a comprehensive review of all aspects of policing in the State and has considerable experience and expertise. I very much welcome the willingness of the Commission to share its perspective with the Authority in advance of completing its work in September 2018. This will assist in ensuring that potential candidates have as much information as possible in relation to the future direction of policing in the State. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the progress made by the Authority I would expect that the Government will be in a position to formally approve the Authority to invite the Public Appointments Service to conduct the selection process in mid-December. I would anticipate that it will take between four to six months to identify and appoint a successful candidate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-30a.287.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017113000053#WRE05200"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I have previously put on record my deep concern at the serious failures of the Garda organisation in relation to mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints and fixed charge notices.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular issue of whether disciplinary action should be taken against individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising from the mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints issues, this is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 2007. </p>  <p>  During his public meeting with the Policing Authority on 23 November, the Commissioner apologised for the significant organisational failure and acknowledged the resulting public disquiet. </p>  <p>  He stated that, taking into consideration that the Policing Authority examination found that the discrepancy between the PULSE figures and the devices was likely to be significantly greater than the 1.458 million figure already identified by the Garda authorities, the scale of such an investigation, its associated costs and resourcing requirement were significant factors in deciding not to undertake individual disciplinary actions.  Further consideration was also given to the inevitability of legal challenges to such action, the passage of time, and associated retirements, and poor data quality, which would all have additional delay, cost or other implications.  </p>  <p>  The Commissioner also informed the Authority that the decision to take a future-focused, restorative approach allowed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to focus on strategic reforms, changes to culture and embedding the Code of Ethics and performance management system, along with improving data quality. </p>  <p>  He confirmed that he will be issuing a personal directive to all members stating that distortion of data quality and data breaches will amount to a serious disciplinary matter and could, at the most serious level, result in dismissal. The Commissioner also indicated that he would be specifically and individually writing to each Divisional manager to highlight their responsibilities in relation to supervision and accountability. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Policing Authority to ensure oversight of policing practices, shed light on problems and identify solutions through its structured engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Policing Authority's commentary on the Crowe Horwath report, where the Authority, in relation to this point, stated that "poor performance on a pervasive scale can seldom be appropriately addressed by disciplinary processes". The Authority further commented that the focus should be on implementing a meaningful performance management system for both Garda members and civilians in 2018, so that there is a framework for the delivery of policing plans and ensuring accountability.</p>  <p>  The Authority went on to indicate that, unless there is prima facie evidence of either a criminal offence or a disciplinary breach having been committed, the core focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should now be on rectifying the issues identified permanently across all dimensions, including procedures, technology, training, supervision and accountability.  I fully expect the Commissioner to urgently address the issues highlighted by myself, by Crowe Horwath and by the Policing Authority and I welcome the continuing  oversight of the Policing Authority in this respect. This Government has put in place significant Garda resources, both human and financial, but, as the Policing Authority has emphasised, cultural change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of critical importance.  This is why one of the Policing Authority&rsquo;s first acts was to introduce a Garda Code of Ethics. Adherence to that code must become a fundamental part of our policing.  I previously made clear to Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in that Garda management must ensure that all members are committed to the values the Code sets out. I am confident that he and his colleagues understand the importance of ensuring that cultural change goes hand in hand with systemic improvements.  The Policing Authority has a critical role to play in supporting and overseeing this process. Moreover, it is important to remember that the expert Commission on the Future of Policing is undertaking a significant root and branch analysis of policing in Ireland.  I have no doubt that this report will inform the Commission's work to bring about the transformation of policing in this country. However, I fully acknowledge the vital work undertaken everyday by the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the safety and security of the people of Ireland. I remain dedicated to doing everything in my power as Minister, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to ensure ethical and excellent policing, robust oversight and the modernisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure it can operate effectively and professionally in the public interest.  </p></reply>

The Boards of organisations funded by my Departments, including those bodies directly under my Department's remit, should ensure that as employers, they are compliant with all employment legislation, including those aspects relating to bullying and harassment in the workplace.</p>  <p>  While the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions, I understand a number of conditions related to financial assistance being operated by the Council apply to its funding recipients. These conditions include a requirement that recipients must comply with all laws applicable to the body in question, including statutory obligations under employment law, statutes, regulations and revenue requirements. In addition, recipients must avoid any form of discriminatory practice and have regard for the need to promote equal opportunities in all areas of work in compliance with the provisions of the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011. I also understand that the Arts Council will be reviewing its conditions in the light of recent events.</p>  <p>  Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, dignity, fairness and equality in the workplace. In recent times, there have been a number of alarming allegations and reports of sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace relating to the arts community. While all workplaces are obliged to comply with employment legislation, my predecessor has identified a number of actions that can be taken in respect of the bodies reporting to my Department. </p>  <p>  These actions include:</p>  <p>  - arranging separate dedicated governance workshops for board members and senior staff, with a particular emphasis on issues relating to bullying abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace;</p>  <p>  - working on a collaborative basis with the Arts Council to make similar training available to other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country at a series of regional information days;</p>  <p>  - highlighting once again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations by seeking assurances of their compliance with obligations under employment legislation; and</p>  <p>  - accelerating a planned review of compliance by bodies reporting to the Department with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these support measures will contribute to the further enhancement of existing governance structures in bodies reporting to my Department. </p></reply>

It is important therefore that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the 5 year Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced last year.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance with National Standards.  </p><p>This investment programme will see the provision of two new centres in Donegal, namely in Ballyshannon and also a 130 bed centre, centrally located in Letterkenny.</p><p>Since the announcement in 2016, and following discussions with public representatives, Health Forum members and local community groups, local HSE management in CHO 1 agreed to review overall requirements for the area. The Terms of Reference for the Rhatigan's review were as follows:</p><p>1. Assess current and future needs for short/long term bed capacity taking into account of up to date census data from the Central Statistics Office;</p><p>2. Based on current planning norms define scale of public/private provision required to meet this need up to 2026; </p><p>3. Assess the adequacy of existing facilities in St Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital Stranorlar, Ramelton and Lifford, taking account of amended legislation governing residential care standards 2016;</p><p>4. Recommend changes to the approved capital programme, if appropriate, taking into account capital and revenue costs, geographical factors, integration of care with acute services and time frames for delivery; </p><p>5. Make specific recommendations regarding dementia care provision; and </p><p>6. Based on the above to finalise brief and options appraisals for infrastructural developments proposed.</p><p>I understand that the report has now been received by Social Care division and will be considered over the coming period.</p><p>Any proposals for changes to the approved Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units would have to be considered in the context of capital funding available to Health, potential revenue implications and compliance with the agreed capital approval process.</p></reply>

This group includes representation from acute, rehabilitation and community services  .</p><p>The first national stroke care audit report in 2006 reported one stroke unit in the country.  In 2016, 65.6% of Stroke patients were admitted to a Stroke Unit.  Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced mortality rates, reduced dependency and shorter lengths of stay in hospital by patients. Since the commencement of the National Clinical Programme for Stroke (NCPS), nine new stroke units have been opened, bringing the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-two. Two further stroke units are currently in development with a third at planning stages. It was recommended in the National Stroke Programme Model of Care 20  12 recommends that all hospitals admitting stroke patients should have a Stroke Unit large enough to accommodate all stroke patients. </p><p>In relation to early supported discharge it has been recognised internationally that Early Supported Discharge of stroke patients from hospital, improves outcomes, reduces need for long term care and increases acute hospital capacity by freeing up beds. It is estimated that 10-25% of patients could benefit from an ESD service. </p><p>The NCPS has helped to establish 3 small but effective ESD teams in Dublin and Galway.  In 2016, 137 patients were discharged to ESD services representing 15.6% of total stroke discharges. It is estimated that there was an average reduction in length of stay of 10.4 days per ESD patient. </p><p>Funding for increasing capacity in the three operational sites was secured for 2017 with further funding secured to support the establishment of two further teams in University Hospital Limerick and Cork University Hospital. Recruitment of these ESD staff is on-going. </p><p>The HSE is currently in the process of preparing its 2018 National Service Plan and discussions are continuing with my Department.  The timeframes for submission of the HSE Service Plan for approval are set down in legislation and on receipt of the letter of determination, the HSE has 21 days to prepare and submit its Service Plan for 2018 for my approval. Following this, the National Service Plan will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and then published at the earliest possible time.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. </p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions with GP representatives on a new GP contract is under way.  These discussions  are wide ranging and ambitious in their scope.  Proposals around further structured programmes for the management of chronic diseases are being considered in this context.  I think it is important to acknowledge that, as with any negotiation-type process, and given the range and complexity of the issues being discussed, this process will take time.  I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p></reply>

Clot-dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) can contribute to improved outcomes for treated patients, with one-third experiencing important improvements in their ability to walk or self-care and other possible disabling conditions caused by the stroke with sometimes complete reversal of the effects of the stroke. More recently a new therapy, Thrombectomy, has been developed where people with the most severe strokes can have their strokes treated by skilled interventional neuroradiologists who remove the obstructing clots via their blood vessels. This has been shown to halve the mortality and disability from such strokes in some patients.</p><p>HIQA who completed a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) found that this intervention is value for money. Full report of the HIQA HTA can be found at: . </p><p>Provision of emergency endovascular thrombectomy remains highly specialised in Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital and this model has been endorsed by the HSE, Acute Hospital Division with a view to a third centre when numbers increase as expected. </p><p>To date, the number of patients undergoing this procedure has risen annually, on average almost 50% increase each year: 2015 - 122 cases; 2016 -172 cases; 2017 (end of August) 154 cases. These patients have been referred from 20 different hospitals around the country.</p><p>Emergency thrombolysis is provided to patients in all parts of the country, via improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new stroke physicians. The national stroke thrombolysis rate has increased from 1% in 2006 to 12% in 2016. </p><p>The National Clinical Programme for Stroke (NCPS) has developed a number of initiatives including a telemedicine programme to allow delivery of expert thrombolysis therapy in smaller level three hospitals. It has been involved in the training of over 250 doctors nationally to deliver thrombolysis therapy and has participated in a training programme for Stroke in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. </p><p>The HSE is currently in the process of preparing its 2018 National Service Plan and discussions are continuing with my Department.  The timeframes for submission of the HSE Service Plan for approval are set down in legislation and on receipt of the letter of determination, the HSE has 21 days to prepare and submit its Service Plan for 2018 for my approval. Following this, the National Service Plan will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and then published at the earliest possible time.</p></reply>

As previously indicated, the review has a wider scope than previous exercises in that it is examining key elements of primary and community care capacity in addition to acute hospital capacity. </p>  <p>  Independent external technical, analytical and engagement expertise (PA Consulting Services Ltd.) was commissioned by my Department to assist with the health service capacity review process. The work undertaken has involved a detailed, complex and multi-layered exercise, comprising data gathering, analysis of that data, baseline forecasting of both demand and associated capacity requirements for each area and consideration and modelling of the potential impacts of policy change and productivity improvements. </p>  <p>  In addition, the company has consulted widely with stakeholders with a focus on data and modelling validation together with identification, verification and consideration of key policies and initiatives that are likely to have an impact on capacity requirements. Separately, my Department also undertook a public consultation process to facilitate input by members of the public and interested groups into the process. </p>  <p>  A steering group comprising senior officials from my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach, the HSE and experts with a clinical and academic background is providing guidance and oversight of the review process. In addition, an international peer review group comprising three international health experts is in place to review and validate the methodology and findings. </p>  <p>  The Review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity needed. The findings will also inform the development of a new 10 year national capital plan. </p>  <p>  I expect to receive the final report by the end of the year and I would hope to be in a position to have the report published as soon as possible thereafter. </p></reply>

Major trauma involves injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. Based on available data, it is estimated that Ireland has approximately 1,600 major trauma patients each year. Trauma care is a subset of overall Emergency Department activity. Emergency Departments provide 24/7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and surgical conditions with 1,157,074 new Emergency Department attendances in 2016. </p>  <p>  In 2015, my predecessor established a Trauma Policy Steering Group, chaired by Professor Eilis McGovern, to make recommendations in relation to the development of a trauma system for Ireland. Patients who have used trauma services and clinicians were at the heart of the development of the plan. The Group has now completed its report and I intend to bring it to Cabinet before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  Following on from recent media reports, it is important to say that the report is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services. This is about delivering best outcomes for the small number of patients each year who suffer major trauma, that is, injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death, and ensuring they get the right care in the right place at the right time.  </p></reply>

Data from September 2017 shows that the public/private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective in-patient work and at almost 86% for day-case work. This is consistent with the typical 80/20 public/private ratio provided for in Consultant Contract 2008 and the public/private bed designation ratio in the 1997 Common Contract held by approximately 10% of consultants. This aggregate data indicates that the majority of consultants are in compliance with their contracts. </p>  <p>  The framework for the regulation of a consultant's private practice is contained in Section 20 of Consultant Contract 2008. It provides that the public to private practice ratio is to be implemented through the Clinical Directorate structure and gives the employer of the consultant concerned full authority to take all necessary steps to ensure a Consultant's practice shall not exceed the agreed ratio of public to private practice. </p>  <p>  However it is clear that the arrangements in place to manage private activity are not robust enough to deliver compliance in all circumstances and, as a result, some consultants are able to engage in private practice activity at levels that significantly exceed the permitted levels, or else they may engage in significant levels of off-site private practice, although their contract does not provide for this.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are being enforced and to put in place structures that support compliance. I am very clear that consultants must deliver their work commitment to the public system. I have asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure all consultants, those highlighted in the programme and all others, comply with their contractual obligations. In the longer term I have established an independent group, chaired by Dr Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system. This was one of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare Report.</p></reply>

It is worth noting that a significant framework of support for farmers with hen-harrier designated land is already in place through my Department's agri-environment scheme GLAS.  Under GLAS, farmers with hen harrier habitat qualify for a payment of &euro;370 per hectare and can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments.  The GLAS Hen Harrier action has proved hugely successful, with some 2,678 farmers now signed up. This accounts for almost 70% of all farmers with hen harrier habitat and represents a major step forward in the conservation of the bird and in securing important additional income for the farmers concerned.</p></reply>

The Point to Point sector is the backbone of national hunt racing in Ireland and acts as a nursery for the development of horses, riders and trainers.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 115 Point to Points are staged annually throughout the island of Ireland and these are organised and run by hunt clubs.  They are community based events with much voluntary input going into the staging of the meetings.  While they have less formality than on track racing, Point to Points are highly competitive and serve as an important shop window for trade in national hunt horses.  In particular they are a strong source of equine exports to Great Britain.  </p>  <p>  Horse Racing Ireland provides funding annually to Point to Point racing of circa &euro;2.1m which comprises grants to Hunt Clubs to assist with the cost of staging these meetings (&euro;678k), grants for prize money at Point to Points (&euro;688k) and grants to the INHS Committee of the Turf Club to cover the regulation of Point to Points (&euro;714k).  </p>  <p>  The recently published Deloitte Report estimated the expenditure associated with Point to Points at circa &euro;37m per annum and that during the 2015 / 2016 racing season in Ireland and Britain, 1,127 races were won by graduates of the Irish Point to Point sector.</p>  <p>  From 2017, the funding provided to the Turf Club / INHS Committee for Point to Points includes the cost of providing one suitably qualified medical officer at every Point to Point.  This is to ensure that the appropriate level of care and attention is available for riders in the event of injury.</p></reply>

The Irish Wildlife Trust also identifies sprat as the target species for this activity.  The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources. Ireland is strongly committed to ensuring the conservation of the marine life around our coast through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments.</p>  <p>  As previously advised, the Marine Institute is committed to working closely with Industry to obtain increased observer coverage in the sprat fisheries.  In previous years, the observer coverage sampling was only about 1-2 trips per year. 10 such observer trips have taken place in 2017 and landings are also sampled by port staff ashore.  The Marine institute are continuing to work to cover additional trips in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the observer scheme is to obtain biological information on the resource itself and on any other fishery bycatch, i.e. herring, juvenile mackerel, etc. It also aims to gather information on any bycatch this fishery might have of protected, endangered and threatened species, under the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) marine biodiversity scheme such as marine mammals, seabirds and listed fish species.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that these projects/observer schemes will allow for more intensive data collection and enhanced scientific knowledge on any and all possible affects pair trawling has on other fish stocks and the environment as a whole. </p></reply>

The Report is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. Meetings were held in March and July and the most recent took place on 22 November. </p>  <p>  Achievements to date by the Taskforce include:</p>  <p>  - Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer;</p>  <p>  - Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies, including Government working closely with local authorities to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs which will be connected at an early date after award of the NBP contract; </p>  <p>  - ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services. ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map; </p>  <p>  - most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development; </p>  <p>  - Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out. TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms operators. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce is also making progress on two of its actions focussed on tackling blackspots in coverage.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives will assist in improving the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.  </p></reply>

As such, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of funding paid in respect of "non-contact time" prior to 2017.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the preceding, to take account of the additional administrative burden on childcare providers as the result of significant changes to the childcare schemes in 2016-17, including the expansion of the ECCE scheme to include three intake points, contractual changes and the coming into force of the Childcare Regulations, I provided some &euro;14.5m in summer 2017 to be drawn down as a "non-contact time" payment for providers, equivalent to seven days' funding. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;3.5m was allocated to provide a once-off payment in December in respect of the More Affordable Childcare measures being implemented by providers of targeted schemes from September 2017, entitled the Programme Support Payment, or PSP. The objective of the &ldquo;non-contact time&rdquo; payment and the now-titled Programme Support Payment are one and the same.</p>  <p>  These moneys have been made available to providers of all childcare programmes funded by my Department, including both community and private services, which account for 27% and 73% of all early years services in Ireland respectively. As to your question regarding the total amount funded to each, I can inform you that under the &ldquo;non-contact time&rdquo; payment of summer 2017, some &euro;4,189,163 was paid to community services, while &euro;9,233,777 was paid to private services. This amounts to a total value of &euro;13,422,940 to date under the &ldquo;non-contact time&rdquo; payment.</p>  <p>  As the Programme Support Payment of December 2017 has yet to be drawn down by providers of the targeted schemes, its final, total value remains to be seen.   </p></reply>

For the purposes of determining whether an individual&rsquo;s income exceeds the &euro;5,000 annual threshold, income from all sources, including reckonable earnings from insurable employment and all self-employed income, is taken into account.  Income received by participants of the rural social schemes is regarded as reckonable earnings for PRSI purposes.  In the case of an individual with income from a rural social scheme and self-employed income from, for example, farming, their income from all sources will be aggregated to determine if it exceeds &euro;5,000.  Where the income exceeds the threshold, Class S PRSI at 4% may be chargeable on the individual&rsquo;s self-employed income.</p><p>  PRSI on the rural social scheme income is deducted at source by the employer alongside, where appropriate, income tax and USC payable.

His subsequent marriage to his late wife also took place in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  As set out in previous responses on this matter, the provisions pertaining to the recognition of divorce outside the State are set out in Section 5 of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986.  Accordingly, in order for the Northern Ireland divorce to be recognised in this State, one of the parties to the divorce must have been domiciled in Northern Ireland when the divorce proceedings were initiated.  Based on the evidence available to the Department, it appears both parties to the divorce were domiciled in Ireland at that time.  Therefore the divorce and the subsequent marriage that took place in Northern Ireland are not recognised under Irish State Law.  Consequently, there is no entitlement to widower&rsquo;s contributory pension.   </p>  <p>  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision of the deciding officer, they may appeal the decision to the independent Chief Appeals Officer, Social Welfare Appeals Office, D&rsquo;Olier House, D&rsquo;Olier St., Dublin 2. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It recommended that my Department conduct a review, in coordination with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and other relevant stakeholders, to quantify what additional investment is required to equalise treatment between households. It recommended that following such a review, identified investment be provided.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in reviewing the supports available to the rural water community my Department is currently in discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body for the group water sector, on the future subsidy levels for group water schemes.  I expect this review to be concluded shortly in order to allow for any subsidy changes to be introduced from 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of group water scheme subsidy levels, I intend to establish a working group to conduct a wider review of investment needs and rural water services, focusing on issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, and capital investment requirements.  I would expect that this Group will engage widely with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid-2018.</p></reply>
