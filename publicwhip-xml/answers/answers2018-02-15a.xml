Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann receive Exchequer funding via the NTA in relation to the provision of car parking at train stations on the heavy rail network.  I understand that the total expenditure on station extensions including car parking facilities over the last five year period of 2013 to 2017 was &euro;15.4 million. </p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for further reply on the issues raised. </p></reply>

It resulted in the receipt of 54 submissions from a wide range of stakeholders including Government departments, National Governing Bodies of Sport, Local Sports Partnerships and private individuals. </p>  <p>  My Department and I have closely examined the content of these submissions.  The Deputy may be interested to note a number of the key themes emerging from the consultation process, including in particular: </p>  <p> - The vital role of education and training in the delivery of sports measures; </p>  <p> - The need for increased investment in sport, focusing on lifelong participation programmes as well as additional support for high performance athletes. </p>  <p> - The need for greater Cross-Sectoral Co-operation with sports stakeholders and relevant Government Departments, working more closely with Local Authorities in particular; and</p>  <p> - The importance of continued investment in improving Sports Facilities locally, regionally and nationally.</p>  <p>  In addition to a careful  evaluation of all submissions, my officials have held a number of bilateral meetings with Government departments and other key stakeholders during the drafting process in order to inform decision making on the key challenges that confront the sector and the many complex issues that arise in relation to addressing those challenges.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to indicate that this detailed work is nearing completion. Because of the complex, cross-sectoral nature of many of the issues relating to sport, I consider that the time taken to undertake this evaluation and consultation is very much worthwhile.  I hope to be in a position to submit the draft Policy for the approval of my Government colleagues in the coming weeks. If approved, it will be published very shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

Its importance reflects the highly consultative process that has been followed by my Department. A public consultation was initiated in late 2016 and resulted in the receipt of 54 submissions from a wide range of stakeholders including Government departments, National Governing Bodies of Sport, Local Sports Partnerships and private individuals. As indicated earlier, I think this was a most useful exercise in consultation.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have closely examined all of these submissions and I consider it appropriate that I should highlight for the information of Deputy McLoughlin a number of the key themes that emerged from the consultation process.

Allocations under the 2017 round of the programme were announced on the 30th November (local projects) and 21st December (regional projects) with a total of &euro;60m allocated. Under this most recent round of the SCP, the maximum grant which could be applied for was &euro;150,000 for local projects and &euro;200,000 for a regional project.</p>  <p>  Outside of the Sports Capital Programme, my Department has also overseen Government support for significant sporting infrastructure including state contributions to the Croke Park redevelopment, the Aviva Stadium and Thomond Park. At present, my Department is administering the Government grants towards the redevelopment of Pairc Ui Chaoimh (total contribution &euro;30m) and the Kerry Sports Academy at the Institute of Technology Tralee (total planned contribution &euro;7.5m). </p>  <p>  In the longer term, funding of sports facilities is being considered as part of the Sports Policy Review which will be finalised shortly. It is clear however, that there are a number of large sporting facilities which will seek Government support over the coming years.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, as part of the discussions around the Review of The Capital Plan, Minister Ross and I suggested the creation of a new Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) for larger projects where the amount being sought from Government is greater than that available under the SCP. The new National Development Plan which is expected to be published shortly will include further detail of the new Fund.</p>  <p>  My officials will draft the terms and conditions of the new scheme over the coming months. All projects funded under the scheme will be subject to the Public Spending Code and State Aid requirements prior to any funding commitments being made. In terms of calls for proposals, it is envisaged that at a minimum, the National Governing Bodies of Sport and local authorities will be asked to prioritise projects for possible inclusion. The results of the Cost Benefit Analysis/Multi-Criteria Analysis for each project will be a key determinant in deciding which projects are included for funding. It is likely that projects will be allocated funding over a number of years and every effort will be made to ensure a spread of sports and a geographic spread of projects. </p>  <p>  In relation to any specific projects, prior to the details and terms and conditions of the new scheme being finalised and relevant organisations having the opportunity to apply for funding, it is not possible to say which projects will be supported at this stage. </p>  <p>  I hope to have these terms and conditions finalised in the coming months and an announcement to include how and when organisations can apply for the funding will be made at that stage.</p></reply>

The first board appointment will be to the NTA in the coming months.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This resulted in the severe curtailment in funding for road improvement grant programmes, including the Strategic Grant Scheme, in order to focus available funding on maintenance and renewal work.  </p>  <p>  The Building on Recovery Capital Plan 2016-2021 and the Capital Plan Review allocations mark a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes but it is going to take time for funding to build up to the required level.  For now funding will largely continue to support the maintenance of the regional and local road network. While a limited number of improvement projects are scheduled to go ahead over the next few years, funding is not available to commit to additional schemes at this point.  </p>  <p>  My Department is, however, liaising with Cork County Council with a view to positioning the project for development in the post 2021 period.</p></reply>

The internal review will be completed in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Chicago Convention, which is the main international treaty governing the operation of civil aviation, states that no civil aircraft may carry munitions of war over a state without that state&rsquo;s permission.  This requirement is ratified in Irish law by the 1973 Order. Under the terms of the Order the carriage of weapons and munitions of war is prohibited in any civil aircraft in Irish airspace and on board any Irish registered aircraft, unless an exemption is granted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Order, my Department operates a procedure under which airlines wishing to carry weapons or munitions through Irish airspace or airports must apply for each flight at least 48 hours in advance.  My Department seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to foreign policy issues and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to security issues.  The IAA is consulted in relation to aviation safety issues for applications involving munitions that are also categorised as dangerous goods. If any of these bodies objects, an exemption will generally not be granted.</p>  <p>  I should point out that the internal review is examining the Statutory Instrument primarily from an administrative and legal perspective.  There is no proposal to change the long-standing Government policy of permitting aircraft used by the defence forces of various nations to transit through Irish airspace and airports, subject to appropriate terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  In 2017 my Department received 340 applications for exemptions under the 1973 Order for flights seeking to land at Shannon Airport.  334 applications were granted and six were refused.  The statistical information sought by the Deputy is also published at the end of each month on my Department's website.</p></reply>

This significant increase in funding allowed for increasing investment in maintenance and renewal of the network and the rolling stock, and also to provide more funding for safety projects.</p><p>In Budget 2018 I secured an 8% increase in the overall Exchequer funding for PSO services across both the bus and rail networks. That means that a total of over &euro;285 million will be allocated in 2018 to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services across the public transport companies. Budget 2018 also provided for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021.  This represents a 30% increase over the original Capital Plan allocations for 2018-2021 and includes investment of over &euro;1 billion in heavy rail maintenance and infrastructure.</p><p>The public consultation process held by the NTA following the publication of the Rail Review in 2016 helped to begin an informed discussion about the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland. Over 300 submissions were received in response to that consultation process. The NTA has prepared a report of those submissions, which it recently updated to reflect the additional funding which has been made available for rail infrastructure and services in Budget 2018.</p><p>The NTA&rsquo;s updated report on the consultation was received by my Department yesterday. Once I have reviewed it, my intention is to bring the updated report to Government for consideration.  I would expect that the report would be published thereafter by the NTA.</p></reply>

This substantial multi-annual envelope includes funding of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to fundamentally transform Dublin&rsquo;s bus system, so that journeys for bus passengers will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable. At the heart of this proposal is the development of a core network of bus lanes served by radial routes and a network of park and ride facilities at key locations.  </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is completed the proposals will be launched for public consultations in April and May of this year.

Newer systems such as LUAS are fully accessible.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the accessibility retro-fit programme as part of the 4 year capital envelope for public transport announced. An amount of almost &euro;28 million is being made available for accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure in the period 2018 to 2021. The additional funding will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) into the taxi fleet.</p>  <p>  I intend to improve upon that in our National Development Plan over the next 10 years and beyond. Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are being considered under the NDP over the period to 2027. As with all new and recently developed public transport projects, these programmes will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. </p>  <p>  Under the NDP, there will also be a continued investment programme to fund retro-fitting of older existing public transport facilities to enhance accessibility. </p>  <p>  As I outlined to the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport last week, in addition to an increase in funding to improve accessibility, we also need to have people with practical experience of the difficulties experienced by people with disabilities at the decision making table. Following consultations with members of the disability community, I decided to appoint a board member with such experience to the public transport companies under my remit.

I also intend to appoint An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the Appeals Body for purposes of the Regulation.           </p>  <p>  It is my view that provisions of the Regulation &ndash; (including the appointment of an independent regulator, a detailed and technical assessment of airport noise, the application of international best practice noise management measures, a provision for public consultation and an independent appeals process) &ndash; represent a huge improvement on current arrangements and that full implementation is in the broad national interest and in the best interests of residents and Dublin Airport.</p></reply>

I have every confidence in the suitability and capacity of Fingal County Council to carry out this important role. </p>  <p>  The full details of how the Regulation will be implemented, including the role and responsibilities of Fingal County Council, will be set out in primary legislation, the drafting of which Government has mandated to commence immediately.  I can assure the Deputies that the draft legislation will include a provision for additional funding for Fingal to ensure that it will have the necessary resources to carry out airport noise regulation.  There is no question of Fingal having to carry out this new function from within existing resource levels. It is my intention to publish a draft Bill later in the year which will also include the appointment of An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the Appeals Body for purposes of the Regulation.</p></reply>

Increased allocations have also been provided to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to invest in its heavy rail maintenance programme, as well as improved signalling and a national train control centre which will benefit the network as a whole.

Additional current funding of approximately &euro;1.9m has also been provided to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2018 for Brexit-related activities and the development of the Midlands brand.  The breakdown of this funding is a matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  The nature of the project to develop a compelling proposition to attract substantial numbers of tourists into the Midlands means that very significant capital funding would be required over many years to provide the tourism products and attractions necessary.  As a first step of this multi-annual project, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed an operational plan for the Midlands and the brand name and identity is scheduled to go live by the end of Q2 2018.  It is important to note that the operational plan for the branding is the first step in a project that will require very significant capital and current funding and several years to deliver.    </p>  <p>  I am referring the Deputy's questions to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for further information and direct reply to the Deputy.  Please contact my private office if you have not received a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

However, the decline in the numbers visiting from Great Britain remains a concern. The fall in the value of sterling against the euro following the Brexit vote in the UK has been the primary factor in this.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland has a programme of marketing activity in place for 2018 to ensure Ireland is marketed appropriately with potential visitors from Britain. That marketing effort will continue throughout the year.  In addition, Minister Griffin recently joined Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to launch an initiative, specially designed to boost tourist numbers from Britain to the Wild Atlantic Way. A &euro;1.35 million marketing campaign in Britain will be complemented by a F&aacute;ilte Ireland &euro;500,000 programme to support businesses along the Wild Atlantic Way to position themselves to benefit from the campaign, as well as to boost its own marketing campaigns in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Additionally, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s 'Get Brexit Ready' programme offers a suite of industry supports, designed to  help businesses meet specific Brexit-related challenges.  The programme allows individual businesses to self-assess their exposures and risks and provides a range of interventions to match their needs.</p>  <p>  Finally, in Budget 2018 &euro;2m in capital funding was secured for Tourism Ireland to invest in strengthening its digital infrastructure, deepening its understanding of the all-important overseas consumer and developing new creative content. This will give Ireland real stand-out and inspire and motivate people across the world to visit Ireland. </p></reply>

Whilst significant investment has been undertaken in recent years in cycling infrastructure, I firmly believe that further continued investment is required to ensure cycling is seen as a safe and attractive option for cyclists of all ages. </p>  <p>  I was delighted to have secured, as part of Budget 2018, a significant increase in the level of Exchequer capital funding available for investment in cycling infrastructure over the period 2018-2021. Capital investment of over &euro;110m will develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and Regional Cities over the next four years. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently preparing a National Greenways Strategy. Budget 2018 saw an increase of &euro;30 million in the multi-annual allocation for Greenways bringing the total allocation for the development of Greenways for the period 2018-2021 to over &euro;55 million.</p>  <p>  In addition to these cycling-specific investments, other infrastructure investments will also significantly benefit cyclists. The considerable investment of about three-quarters of a billion euro for re-configuring the bus network as part of BusConnects will entail construction of new cycling facilities alongside bus routes on key routes including the provision of safe cycling facilities. In addition, some of the &euro;135m funding that will be provided to local authorities in the GDA and the Regional Cities for Sustainable Urban Transport between 2018 and 2021 will support better traffic management, bus priority measures and pedestrian infrastructure - which will benefit the safe and effective movement of all.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to be fund behavioural change measures to encourage more people to take up cycling and to ensure cyclist safety. Funding is provided to the NTA for programmes such as Workplace and Campus travel programmes and the Green Schools Programmes, Cycling Ireland for the "Cycle Right" school training programme, and to the RSA for road safety promotion including campaigns specifically targeting cyclist safety. </p>  <p>  This coordinated investment strategy will, I believe, have a lasting transformative effect on the levels of cycling, and our transport network over the coming years.</p></reply>

The National Planning Framework will form an important context for consideration of issues raised by the Rail Review Report which was undertaken jointly by the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and published in late 2016.  As the Deputy is aware, the NTA held a public consultation on the published Review which helped to begin an informed discussion about the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland. Over 300 submissions were received in response to that consultation process. The NTA has prepared a report of those submissions, which it is currently updating to reflect the additional funding which has been made available for rail infrastructure and services in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Western Rail Corridor, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to provide for an independent costing and review of the Western Rail Corridor Phase Two between Athenry and Claremorris.   It also commits that no measures will be taken to prevent the future reactivation of the Western Rail Corridor for rail use.  The costing and review has not been undertaken pending the advancement of the wider processes underway, including the Rail Review and the National Planning Framework, that are highly relevant to the general rail environment.  </p>  <p>  Once I have received and reviewed the NTA&rsquo;s updated report on the Rail Review consultation, it is my intention to bring it to Government for consideration.  As I have previously stated, I have no plans regarding the closure of any parts of the rail network.  The Taoiseach also gave assurances in the D&aacute;il recently that there are no plans in this regard.  </p></reply>

Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is currently undertaking a strategic review of Rosslare Europort and expects to have this completed by the end of March.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), in conjunction with my Department, has commenced a study into the use of the UK Land-bridge by Irish importers and exporters. The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK Land-bridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on Land-bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable. This piece of research is also expected to be completed by the end of March and should inform the potential for the future utilisation of all Ports, including Rosslare Europort.</p></reply>

Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo.</p>  <p>  As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  My Department provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) with over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design. </p>  <p>  This year I have given an allocation of &euro;25,000 to Cavan County Council to enable the Council to undertake a preliminary appraisal, in line with the current requirements in the Public Spending Code and the Capital Investment Framework, of the Cavan to Dundalk section of the route.  The aim of this appraisal would be to assess the extent to which the scheme or elements of it can be justified in terms of appraisal and advanced for further consideration in relation to schemes for development post 2021. </p>  <p>  As regards the national road projects mentioned, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects  is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to TII for direct reply.

This represents a 30% increase over the original Capital Plan allocations for 2018-2021 and includes increased funding for the heavy rail network. </p>  <p>  Over &euro;770 million will be invested in the BusConnects programme to fundamentally transform our bus system, so that journeys for bus passengers will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable. At the heart of this proposal is the development of continuous bus lanes as far as is practicable along the busiest bus corridors along with a network of park and ride facilities at key locations.  Work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is completed the proposals will be launched for public consultations in April and May of this year. </p>  <p>  The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign, Core Bus Corridors and park and ride facilities. </p>  <p>  I am advised that due to the extension of the Short-Hop fare zone to include Sallins &amp;amp; Naas Railway Station, coupled with the introduction of train services through the Phoenix Park Tunnel Link to serve Connolly, Tara, Pearse and Grand Canal Dock, the level of car parking demand at this station has increased significantly.  To address this issue, it is intended to expand the level of car parking at Sallins &amp;amp; Naas Railway Station during 2018 through an expansion of the car park on the north side of the station.  Funding in the amount of &euro;680,000 is being allocated to Iarn&oacute;id Eireann this year in respect of this project.   </p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter I have referred your question to the NTA for an update on the issues raised.

Whilst significant investment has been undertaken in recent years in cycling infrastructure, I firmly believe that further continued investment is required to ensure cycling is seen as a safe and attractive option for cyclists of all ages. Investment in cycling infrastructure has a key role to play and in this regard, I was delighted to have secured, as part of Budget 2018, a significant increase in the level of Exchequer capital funding available for investment in cycling infrastructure over the period 2018-2021.</p>  <p>  Capital investment of over &euro;110m will develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and Regional Cities over the next four years (2018-2021). This programme will provide safe, alternative, active, travel routes to help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently preparing a National Greenways Strategy, building on the success of facilities such as the Great Western Greenway and the Waterford Greenway. Budget 2018 saw an increase of &euro;30 million in the multi-annual allocation for Greenways bringing the total allocation for the development of Greenways for the period 2018-2021 to over &euro;55 million.</p>  <p>  In addition to these cycling-specific investments, some other infrastructure investments over the next four years will provide enhancements that will benefit cyclists.  The considerable investment of about three-quarters of a billion euro for re-configuring the bus network and infrastructure will also entail construction of significant new cycling facilities alongside bus routes on the key radial routes into the city centre and provide safe cycling arrangements, largely segregated from other traffic along those corridors.  In addition, some of the &euro;135m funding that will be provided to local authorities in the GDA and the Regional Cities for Sustainable Urban Transport between 2018 and 2021 will support better traffic management, bus priority measures and pedestrian infrastructure - which will benefit the safe and effective movement of all.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to be very active in promoting behavioural change to encourage more people to take up cycling and to cycle safely. We provide funding to the NTA on an annual basis for the delivery of behavioural change programmes such as Workplace and Campus travel programmes and the Green Schools Programmes. Furthermore, my Department engaged Cycling Ireland to develop a new national cycle training standard - "Cycle Right" &ndash; which was rolled out in January 2017 to approximately 15,000 primary school students. My Department supports the great work that is being done by RSA in the promotion of safe roads for all road users, including the more vulnerable users such as cyclists and pedestrians. In addition my Department provides funding to local authorities throughout the country to assist in organising events and activities during Bike Week which further serve to increase the number of cyclists on our roads.</p>  <p>  As part of an overall coordinated approach to the provision of an integrated sustainable transport network of cycling, walking and public transport, these various investments will allow us to further increase the numbers cycling, thereby easing congestion, improving public health and enhancing the liveability of our towns and cities; the investment will, I believe, have a lasting transformative effect on our transport network over the coming years.</p></reply>

Instead it is proposed that an enhanced bus service would be provided along the corridor in conjunction with the development of a bus hub by the local authority in Navan. </p>  <p>  The NTA has indicated that this position will be kept under review and will be reassessed as part of the next review of the GDA Transport Strategy which, under the relevant legislation, the NTA is required to undertake every six years. The next review planned for 2021 will take account of the level of development in the catchment area over the coming years. Furthermore, the NTA has also indicated that the corridor identified for a rail link to Navan should be protected from development intrusion in the meantime. If the review of the GDA Transport Strategy concludes that a rail link is justified at that point, funding can be pursued in the context of the development and review of Capital Investment Plans. </p></reply>

Using Sport Ireland&rsquo;s survey, the &quot;Irish Sports Monitor&quot; (ISM), the CSO identified that participation in sport had fallen by 2% between 2013 and 2015.  </p><p>Sport Ireland published the 2017 half year ISM report in December 2017 shows a 1% fall in participation levels compared to the same period in 2015. A full year report for 2017 is expected to be published in the second quarter of 2018 when a more definitive picture of the current situation will emerge. </p><p>The ISM report suggests that the drop in participation levels in recent years has been driven primarily by declining levels of participation among young males in particular. While this is still the group with the highest levels of participation overall, there is evidence to suggest that the upturn in our economic circumstances in the past few years has resulted in increased time pressures on certain groups, particularly young males. </p><p>Sport Ireland is committed to providing enhanced sporting opportunities targeted at those less likely to participate through the Local Sports Partnership network, National Governing Bodies and other partners. Programmes such as the Community Sports Hub initiative, Sports Inclusion Disability Programme, Go For Life and Women in Sport are aimed at providing targeted opportunities for disadvantaged groups, people with disabilities, older people and women where participation levels are generally lower than among comparator groups. </p><p>In the context of a new National Sports Policy that is currently being finalised there will be a strong focus on increasing participation levels in sport and physical activity at all ages.  Achieving such increased participation levels is a significant challenge that will require the development of new projects and programmes in the future as well as continued implementation of existing successful initiatives. Additionally, my Department is co-chairing the National Physical Activity Plan implementation group. Significant progress has been made in relation to actions within that Plan, details of which are available in a progress report published on the Healthy Ireland website in December 2017 </p></reply>

Fully functioning, devolved, power-sharing Institutions are the only way forward for Northern Ireland, and are urgently required.</p>  <p>  Yesterday&rsquo;s developments in Stormont, in particular the DUP statement, are obviously of serious concern to all of us who want to see the establishment of a functioning, power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland, and the other Institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  </p>  <p>  I was in regular contact with the Secretary of State yesterday, both before and following this announcement, and will remain in close contact as we reflect on the next steps the two Governments need to take in relation to the political process. </p>  <p>  The two Governments have worked steadfastly together over the past year, assisting and facilitating the parties in their efforts to reach agreement on the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.  In recent days, we believed that there was a genuine basis for an accommodation between the two largest parties.  Such an accommodation would then have facilitated broader engagement with all the political parties on the establishment of a new Executive.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, devolved power-sharing government can only operate on the basis of an agreement between the two largest parties. Unfortunately, this has not been achieved to date, despite intensive engagement.</p>  <p>  The Government is working with the British Government to see if there is any prospect of re-engagement with the parties in the period ahead. </p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish Governments have an obligation to uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that Agreement, and we will also be considering how best to do so in the current situation.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Department has no role in the granting of Primary Medical Certificates to any applicant.  The PMC is issued by the relevant Senior Medical Officer in the HSE, or failing that an appeal may be made to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeals.  The Medical Board of Appeals must be independent in its determinations and so the Department has no influence over the outcome of any appeal.</p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT forgone, and the fuel grant, the scheme cost approximately &euro;65m in each of 2016 and 2017.  This figure does not include the revenue forgone in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  From time to time I receive representations on behalf of individuals and organisations who believe they would benefit from the scheme but do not qualify under the criteria.  While I have sympathy for such cases, given the scale and scope of the scheme, there are no plans to review the medical criteria eligibility at this time.</p></reply>

Commercial vehicles such as heavy goods vehicles had no economically viable alternative and the reduced excise rate on diesel was applied in recognition of this and the role of transport in the wider economy where added fuel costs could ultimately translate into added retail prices. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless I am aware that a balance must be struck between the different policy objectives, which of course include environmental objectives.

In that regard, Revenue is looking at new telephony technology which will provide a robust, reliable and scalable telephone service that does not rely on 1890 architecture.  Revenue is also exploring the use of other technologies that will enable customers - using their existing &lsquo;inclusive packages&rsquo; (bundle) - to &lsquo;phone&rsquo; Revenue from links within its website and mobile app (RevApp) without incurring the 1890 telephone costs.  Revenue hope to launch these, where feasible, sometime in 2018.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that, in 2017, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) held a public consultation on the current 5 classes of &ldquo;Non-Geographic Number&rdquo; (NGN) &ndash; <b>1800</b>(Freephone), <b>1850</b>(Shared cost &ndash; fixed charge per call), <b>1890</b>(Shared cost &ndash; charge per minute), <b>0818</b>(Universal access), and <b>076</b>(Nomadic).  Views were invited from interested parties and Revenue made a submission expressing its dissatisfaction at the rates charged for 1890 calls.  In its submission, Revenue agreed with ComReg&rsquo;s proposal that the retail charge that should apply to a caller for calling any of the NGN numbers at a particular point in time should not exceed the retail charge that would apply to that same caller for calling a Geographic Number at that same point in time.  Revenue is awaiting the outcome of the ComReg consultation process and any recommendations therefrom.</p><p>On a wider note, I am further informed by Revenue that it has enhanced its range of online services to reduce the need for customer telephone contact.  This includes a new website which is designed around customer needs which will help customers easily find the information they are looking for.  In addition, Revenue has rewritten a considerable portion of the content on the website in plain language to make it easier for customers to understand.</p></reply>

The Commission was established on 21 March 2016 following the commencement of the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015.  The following table outlines the number of cases heard from September, 2017 to January, 2018, by tax type and the number of cases heard in 2017 but awaiting determination:<table><tr><th>Appeals Heard  - 2017</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Month</td><td>No. of Appeals Heard</td><td>Tax type</td><td>No. of Cases awaiting   Determination</td></tr><tr><td>Jan</td><td>5</td><td>IT, CT, Customs   &amp;amp; Excise and VAT</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Feb</td><td>7</td><td>IT, CT, CGT and   Artist&rsquo;s Exemption</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mar</td><td>3</td><td>IT, CT, VRT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>9</td><td>IT, CT, VAT, CGT and   Customs &amp;amp; Excise</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Jun</td><td>6</td><td>IT, VAT, CGT, CAT   and Customs &amp;amp; Excise</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Jul</td><td>1</td><td>IT</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Aug</td><td>2</td><td>IT</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sep</td><td>6</td><td>IT, LPT</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Oct</td><td>3</td><td>IT, VRT and Stamp   Duty</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nov</td><td>7</td><td>IT, CAT, VRT</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dec</td><td>2</td><td>CT, VRT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Appeals Heard -   2018</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Month</td><td>No. of Appeals Heard</td><td>Tax type</td><td>No. of Cases awaiting   Determination</td></tr><tr><td>Jan</td><td>1</td><td>IT</td><td>0</td></tr></table>In addition to the above appeals heard in 2017, the TAC also held 89 Case Management Conferences (CMCs) relating to 575 appeals.  A CMC is an informal hearing, at which parties to the appeal are directed to attend, with a view to assisting all parties reaching a settlement or agreement more expeditiously, without the need to conduct a formal hearing.  As a result of these CMCs, 38 appeals were closed, a further 33 were withdrawn or settled and approximately 350 are currently being adjudicated on, without the need for a formal hearing.  The TAC is also planning to move to new premises in 2018.  This should facilitate the conduct of multiple hearings of all natures, occurring parallel, and should significantly increase the number of determinations and settled appeals, in 2018.  In relation to all such matters, I am advised that the TAC anticipates there will be more detail about the appeals on hand and the process of dealing with them, in its Annual Report, which will be produced in March.</p><p>Since the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission in 2016, I am informed that approximately 3,322 appeals transferred to the TAC, at various stages during 2016, from both the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  The TAC has further advised me that, as of 30 January, it currently has approximately 3,648 appeals under its remit but this does not mean that each appeal will require a hearing.  Quite often, settlements are reached between Appellants and the Revenue Commissioners when statements of cases have been shared and discussed.  As mentioned above, Case Management Conferences have proved very successful in settling appeals and there should be more detail about these, in the forthcoming Annual Report of the Commission.</p><p>The Deputy may also note that the TAC have informed me that in 2017, 26 determinations on appeals were made, but the TAC closed a further 569 cases without the need for a hearing, by way of Case Management Conferences and other means.</p></reply>

This registration process involved the completion and submission of an appropriate registration form; Form A for those firms authorised under Section 10 of the IIA, or Form B for those firms previously deemed to be an authorised firm under the IIA.</p>  <p>  Two subsequent letters were issued by the Bank to firms who did not return Forms A or B; on 11 February 2008 and again on 4 March 2010.  The March 2010 letter provided the final opportunity for IIA authorised entities, providing insurance mediation, to avail of this registration process.  Therefore, Forms A and B ceased to be valid registration forms when firms did not reply to the Bank&rsquo;s correspondence of March 2010. </p>  <p>  Since then, all firms wishing to be registered under the IMR have been required to follow the application process which is outlined on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I have also been advised by the Bank that there were approximately 2,500 IIA firms authorised to undertake insurance mediation before the commencement of the IMR.  There are currently 2,615 firms registered as Insurance &amp;amp; Reinsurance Intermediaries under the IMR.  The Bank has informed me that it does not have figures available on how many of these firms were registered by completing Form A or Form B and how many were registered under the current registration process.</p>  <p>  The register of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries maintained under the IMR includes the names of firms and the dates that they were registered with the Central Bank and it is available at this link http://registers.centralbank.ie/DownloadsPage.aspx. </p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Insurance Act 1964, as amended, monies may be paid out of the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), with the approval of the High Court, in relation to an insolvent insurer, to meet claims up to a limit of 65% or &euro;825,000 of the claim, whichever is the lesser.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my decision in principle that the State will ensure that Setanta third party claimants are compensated in full, which was announced on 30 January.  The Department of Finance is now working through the detailed arrangements to implement this decision, which is likely to require legislative change.  In this regard, the next step is to give consideration as to whether there is any state aid or other legal issue associated with the proposed approach.  The Department is currently working with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on this issue and once the position is clarified I can give an indication of the likely timeline for payment, including the payment of the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim subject to the limits outlined above.</p>  <p>  The liquidator for Setanta Insurance has informed me that as of 31 December 2017, there are 1,577 active claims, of these 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limits.</p>  <p>  No date has been fixed for the next payment from the ICF, but the Liquidator has informed me that preparatory work is underway in respect of some 275 claims to the value of c &euro;5.8m, with a view to the Accountant to the High Court making an application before the end of March. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  It is hoped that by the State taking steps to ensure that third party claimants are compensated in full, this will encourage the settlement of all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

NAMA acquired loans and the properties securing those loans continue to be managed by their legal owners or, in the case of enforcement, by duly appointed insolvency practitioners, who are responsible for the management of the properties and for decisions regarding future strategy for the properties. Under Section 10 of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA is required to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State from its acquired loans and the properties that secure its loans.  As Minister for Finance, I have no role in respect of NAMA's commercial operations or decisions.</p>  <p>  In this instance, I am advised that the lands referred to by the Deputy are currently under the control of a receiver.  Prior to the receiver&rsquo;s appointment, I am advised that Tyrrellstown GAA Club entered into a temporary, informal agreement with the property owner.  This informal agreement enabled the club to use the lands on a temporary basis, free of charge.  It was expected that community playing fields developed by Fingal County Council would cater for the needs of sports clubs in the Tyrrellstown area, and I understand that this agreement with Tyrrellstown GAA Club was always accepted by the club as being no more than a temporary arrangement until such time as the owner of the land &ndash; in this case, the receiver &ndash; determined the ultimate strategy for the land concerned. </p>  <p>   I am also advised that following the appointment of a receiver over the lands, the receiver sought to regularise the existing informal arrangement by way of a formal licence agreement.  A draft licence agreement was forwarded to the club in October 2017, but as yet, the club has not responded to repeated contacts from the receiver to finalise this agreement. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the lands the club currently occupy are zoned for mixed-use development, not for amenity purposes.  As a result, I understand it will not be possible for the club to remain in this location on a long-term basis.

The Group A threshold (currently &euro;310,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.  The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases. </p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit.  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances which are in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.</p>  <p>  There are no exemptions from CAT for the gifting of a site.  The gift tax that would be payable in the circumstances set out by the Deputy would depend on the value of the site in question, how the benefit is distributed among the beneficiaries and whether each beneficiary had received previous gifts or inheritances within his or her relevant Group threshold.  The daughter&rsquo;s partner would be in the Group C threshold even if he was married to her, as he is not a relative of the disponer under Groups A or B. </p>  <p>  There is an exemption from capital gains tax where an individual transfers a site to his or her child to enable the child to build a house on the site to be occupied by that child as his or her only or main residence. In order to qualify for the exemption, the value of the site must not exceed &euro;500,000 and the area of the site must not exceed 0.4047 hectare (1 acre). </p></reply>

The strategic mission of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs that address failures in the Irish credit market, while driving competition and innovation and ensuring the efficient use of available EU resources.  The SBCI achieves this aim through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk sharing activities supporting the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to SMEs.</p>  <p>  The SBCI uses an on-lending model.  This means it does not lend directly to SMEs, rather the SBCI channels funds through partners, known as on-lenders.  These on-lenders are both banks and non-banks finance providers.  Since March 2015, to the end of December 2017, the SBCI has supported loans totalling &euro;925 million to 22,928 Irish SMEs employing 119,533 people and operating in all sectors of the Irish economy, including agriculture, food, retail, healthcare, transport and manufacturing. </p>  <p>  The SBCI expects to announce further on-lenders in 2018. In this regard, the SBCI is actively engaging with potential future on-lenders, in particular non-bank finance providers.  This will allow the SBCI to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage. Entering in to agreements with on-lending partners is subject to a robust due diligence process by the SBCI to ensure any risks to SMEs, European funding partners and Irish taxpayers are sufficiently mitigated.  </p>  <p>  The SBCI is working to develop more innovative products, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme I announced in Budget 2017 and Budget 2018 respectively.  Additionally, the SBCI is also continuing to work on a number of other initiatives, including the continued use of guarantees and risk sharing schemes to support lending by finance providers.  These aim to address recognised market failures.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that the SBCI is working to develop a more diverse range of on-lenders and innovative products in 2018 to meet the evolving requirements of the SME finance market and contribute to a growing and sustainable economy.</p></reply>

The work of the Task Force informed the development of the EU's &quot;Juncker Plan&quot; which included the legislative proposal for the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), launched in November of that year.  </p><p>Ireland, along with all other Member States, submitted a list of potential projects for inclusion in the Task Force's final report.  That list which includes both public and private projects was compiled by the Department of Finance in very close coordination with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, given their responsibility for controlling public capital expenditure.  The list was based on submissions from Departments with responsibility for particular sectors requiring investment, both public and private.  The list, as noted by Government before submission, did not have any overall assessment or prioritisation of the projects and was not a national set of project applications.  It was more accurately a contribution to an EU-wide scoping exercise to gauge the level of potential projects, during the 2015-2017 period, should investment resources become available.  </p><p>The Task Force's final report was published in December 2014 and is available at <i></i>.  </p><p>Since the EFSI Regulation's enactment in July 2015, it has been possible for any project promoter, either public or private, to engage with the EIB regarding the possibility of receiving loans or guarantees under EFSI for particular projects.  </p><p>In general, Government Departments have existing relationships with the EIB so it has been a matter for each Department concerned to advance the projects in coordination with the Government's Capital Plan as coordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department of Finance has no role in assessing projects either public or private which may be the subject of applications for EFSI loans/guarantees.  </p><p>In this way, EFSI is providing an important additional funding possibility alongside other possibilities such as the EIB's normal lending, the State's borrowings through the NTMA and other mechanisms such as PPPs and off-balance sheet vehicles.  It should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.  </p><p>Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including through PPP companies.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP project has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  In addition, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has successfully engaged with European Financial Instruments such as the COSME and the InnovFin Guarantee Programme, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window.  These support the financing needs of SMEs and ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.  </p><p>I can inform the Deputy that there is a publicly available list of Irish projects which have been approved for EFSI support by the EIB which is available on the EIB website at: <i></i>.  The list can be viewed according to each Member State and I would ask the Deputy to be aware that the Irish list contains both private and public sector projects, and it also includes cross-border projects between Irish entities and entities in other Member States.</p></reply>

In addition, the Revenue Pensions Manual gives general guidance on, among other things, how this legislation is to be applied.  </p>  <p>  Revenue rules in relation to "Increases of Pensions in Payment" are set out in Chapter 6.8 of the Revenue Pensions Manual.  These rules allow a pension in the course of payment to be increased up to the level of the maximum approvable at retirement (after deducting the annuity value of any pension exchanged for a lump sum benefit or allocated to a spouse, civil partner or dependant).  For example, depending on service, the maximum pension an individual can receive at normal retirement age is 2/3rds of final remuneration.  However, if the rules of the pension scheme allow, an employee may elect to commute part of the pension for a lump sum. Any such election will cause the amount of the pension in payment to be reduced.  </p>  <p>  Guaranteed increases of a pension in payment under Chapter 6.8 of the Revenue Pensions Manual may be made by using either of the following formulae-</p>  <p>  - a fixed increase of not more than 3% per annum compound, or </p>  <p>  - an increase linked to the Consumer Price Index, or another similar agreed index.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of these rules is to maintain the real value of pension payments and consequently these rules allow for the real value of pensions in payment to be maintained over the course of a pensioner&rsquo;s lifetime. The rules in question have been in existence for over 30 years.  </p>  <p>  I understand that in the past few days there have been reports to the effect that some pension providers are not "paying out" on what are known as 5pc escalators (that is, a fixed yearly increase of 5% in the amount of pension payments) in cases where the increase had been paid for at the time the pension was purchased.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that it is currently engaging with the pensions industry in order to establish the facts surrounding this issue, the extent of the issue, and whether the practice is in line with pension tax legislation and with published Revenue practice in this area. Revenue&rsquo;s enquiry will include the issues raised by the Deputy.  However, as the enquiry has only started within the last few days, the details the Deputy has requested with regard to the number of individuals affected and the amounts involved is not yet available.</p></reply>

In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPLs since the financial crisis.  Despite this progress, the level of NPLs in the Irish banking sector remains well above the European average.  </p>  <p>  Hence the SSM has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge.  In recent years banks have introduced multiple engagement channels to facilitate customers, including those who are reluctant to engage directly with them.  Having exhausted these initiatives, if meaningful engagement is not forthcoming from customers or where affordability does not exist or cannot be established. the bank may be left with no option but to look at alternative solutions.  These could, as a last resort, include the sale of the loan.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be further aware that I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of any of the banks' in which the State has a shareholding.  Under the Relationship Framework Agreements (RFA) the disposal of loans is a commercial decision for the management and Board of each individual institution.  </p>  <p>  I have received the following response from the bank:</p>  <p>  "For commercial reasons the bank is unable to outline any details in relation to specific loan sales at this stage.  </p>  <p>  AIB has reduced its impaired loans to c. &euro;7.3bn from a peak of c. &euro;29bn over the past three years. During this period some impaired portfolios were sold and case by case restructurings continued.  </p>  <p>  The reduction was achieved primarily by working through loans on a case by case basis.  AIB remains focused on reducing impaired loans to a level more in line with normalised European peer levels and will continue to implement sustainable solutions for customers who engage with the bank where feasible.  The bank has c.1,500 people continuing to work in this area and they are supporting and finding solutions for customers.  </p>  <p>  AIB continues to review all options in relation to reducing impaired loans including further sales".  </p></reply>

This transaction was confirmed publicly by the bank earlier this week and has been dubbed Project Glas.  This decision is being taken to help reduce the bank&rsquo;s high level of non-performing loans and is a move prompted by SSM regulatory requirements.  </p>  <p>  As I cannot interfere in the day to day operations of the bank nor the interaction with its regulator, these are decisions for the management and board of the bank and do not require my consent.  Should the portfolio sale process reach an advanced stage, and if it is of a material scale, I would expect to be formally consulted under the bank&rsquo;s Relationship Framework.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the vast majority of the loans for sale are in deep arrears including many that have not engaged with the bank in recent years.  However as the proposed transaction is commercially sensitive, and I must respect stock exchange Market Abuse regulations, it would not be appropriate for me to provide any further commentary on the matter at this point.  </p>  <p>  While loan disposals are regrettable, as Minister for Finance I am conscious of the need for the bank to continue on its path to recovery.  Permanent tsb is a very important part of the Irish banking sector and hence the economy, with over 1 million customers, &euro;21bn of mortgage loans  (gross) and &euro;17bn of customer deposits.

These include the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR), the volume of maturing debt that needs to be refinanced, targeted cash balances and funding from other sources such as short-term paper and State Savings products.  </p><p>As is customary, the NTMA will, in December of each year, announce its planned bond funding range for the following year.  </p><p>Owing to the pre-emptive action taken in recent years, the expected volume of new debt issuance required to refinance maturing debt in the coming years is considerably lower than it was three years ago.  </p><p>The refinancing requirement over the period 2018 &ndash; 2020 has effectively been halved.  </p><p>Through the early repayment of IMF and Swedish and Danish bilateral loans together with the early buyback and switching of near term maturing bonds for longer maturity bonds the 2018 &ndash; 2020 refinancing requirement has been reduced by some &euro;16 billion, from &euro;60 billion to &euro;44 billion.  Furthermore, reflecting the NTMA strategy of pre-funding, Exchequer cash balances stood at over &euro;17 billion at the end of January.  </p><p>The interest on the debt to be issued in the coming years cannot be predicted with certainty.  However, by lowering our refinancing needs to such an extent, we have effectively taken out insurance and reduced our sensitivity to higher interest rates.  </p></reply>

This was confirmed by the European Central Bank (ECB) at its most recent Governing Council meeting in January, when it stated that net asset purchases under the Programme are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond if necessary.  The Governing Council also repeated its expectation that key ECB interest rates will remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.  </p>  <p>  While it is not possible to predict the future path of ECB monetary policy or interest rates, the strategy of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) in recent years has been to take advantage of the favourable market conditions for sovereign issuers wherever possible.  Through taking pre-emptive action over the past three years, it has significantly improved our debt redemption profile in the coming years and lowered our debt interest bill.  </p>  <p>  The refinancing requirement over the period 2018 &ndash; 2020 has effectively been halved.  </p>  <p>  Through the early repayment of IMF and Swedish and Danish bilateral loans together with the early buyback and switching of near term maturing bonds for longer maturity bonds the 2018 &ndash; 2020 refinancing requirement has been reduced by some &euro;16 billion, from &euro;60 billion to &euro;44 billion.  Furthermore, reflecting the NTMA strategy of pre-funding, Exchequer cash balances stood at over &euro;17 billion at the end of January.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the accelerated buy-back and replacement of Floating Rate Notes from the Central Bank of Ireland also locks in current interest rates.  </p>  <p>  These actions reduce refinancing risk for the Exchequer and offer insurance against the possibility of interest rate increases in the coming years.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I should also mention the positive impact these actions have had on the cost of servicing our National debt.  The interest bill, which was as high as &euro;7.5 billion as recently as 2014, fell to just under &euro;6.1 billion last year.  </p></reply>

The Group is building on the existing work and commitment of all the State Agencies involved in flood risk and continues to enhance the ongoing co-ordination and co-operation between members.</p>  <p>  The most recent meeting of the Group was on 23 October 2017, at which the Group decided to progress the development of a proposal for the removal of a series of pinchpoints or constrictions in the navigation channel between Meelick Weir and Athlone, in the Callows area. Constrictions on other stretches of the Shannon, such as that near Plassey are not included in this particular proposal. However, the Group has discussed and is currently considering issues in relation to the Lower Shannon.</p>  <p>  The Callows proposal is currently being developed by OPW and Waterways Ireland and requires a hydraulic analysis, environmental assessment under the appropriate legislation and will be subject to planning. The required planning process would be a matter for Waterways Ireland.  As part of the development of this proposal, the potential impact on flows will be assessed to ensure that any works do not have a negative impact further downstream. The proposal is due to be discussed further at the next meeting of the Group in late March.</p></reply>

None of the recommendations was mandatory.  I have attached a list of these recommendations and their associated timelines for the Deputy's information. </p><p>It was envisaged that, at the end of a three year period, a full review would be undertaken and, as part of the strategic dialogue process, HEIs would be at risk of funding being withheld if they were not addressing gender inequality sufficiently. </p><p>All the Higher Education Authority funded institutions are now required to submit annual staff data disaggregated by gender, to the HEA.  The first report of this data was published as part of the HEA expert group report in 2016, and a second report was published in July 2017.  This data was not available prior to 2016, and there are no plans to undertake a retrospective analysis. </p><p>In light of the limited progress observed in the July 2017 data, a gender equality task force was established in November 2017 to prepare a three year prioritised action plan.  The gender equality task force will also oversee a national systems review of the recruitment and promotion policies and practices currently in place in higher education institutions, with a view to identifying good practice and highlighting areas that need improvement. </p><p>As part of both the HEA expert group report and the work of the gender equality task force, a literature review has been carried out to identify areas of best practice nationally and internationally.

This Policy Statement focusses on the many strengths in STEM education in Ireland while providing a roadmap to address the areas for development.</p>  <p>  Achieving our goals will require a multifacted focus, looking to increase engagement with STEM and progress important curriculum developments, including the redevelopment of the Primary Mathematics Curriculum and introduction of Leaving Certificate Computer Science.  It will also require a significant step-up in support to teachers and school leaders and encouragement of innovation in teaching methods. Implementation of STEM policy will be considered as part of the Teaching Council&rsquo;s review of impact of the reconfigured Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes and its Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers, which undepin all ITE.  We are also looking at measures to increase the supply of STEM teachers.  At post primary level, we are considering the introduction of subject quotas in ITE programmes.  We are also considering the introduction of &ldquo;top up&rdquo; or conversion courses to upskill teachers. I have announced that I want to double the number of places on undergraduate course to train second level teachers, particularly in areas like STEM.</p>  <p>  While the focus of the Policy Statement is on STEM from early years through to post-primary level, there are also important developments underway in the higher education sector which support STEM Policy and highlight the importance of alignment in relation to STEM education across the entire education system.</p>  <p>  Therefore the Deputy can be assured that every effort will be made to assist schools of education to achieve the initial teacher education objectives of the STEM policy statement.</p></reply>

It is also a qualifying payment for the special rate of grant.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for higher income thresholds for larger families.  In addition to this, further increases in the income thresholds are provided for where additional family members are attending further and/or higher education at the same time.

Children in homeless accommodation will be prioritised within the School Completion Programme for services such as breakfast and homework clubs.</p>  <p>  - Additional resources will be put in place to strengthen inter-agency arrangements with Tusla including family Support, Social Work and Education Welfare. Tusla will appoint specific staff to assist in accessing requisite family support and child welfare services and managing any difficulties that arise for children in relation to school participation;</p>  <p>  - A joined-up approach will be promoted between education, health and Tusla to meet the needs of homeless families, by using the existing Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees</p>  <p>  - Access to free public transport will be provided for school journeys and outings away from the emergency accommodation.  </p>  <p>  The staff of schools are very sensitive to the needs of children who are experiencing disruption in their lives and make every effort to support the additional needs they experience. Where they are aware of homelessness and where it is impacting on school attendance and participation they engage closely with the Educational Welfare Service of Tusla and with the support services of my own Department and in particular those of the National Educational Psychological Service which I have strengthened in the past year. </p>  <p>  Identification of Need and Early Intervention and Prevention Strategies are considered key components to supporting children who experience homelessness. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) works with schools through the DES Continuum of Support framework.  NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to Principals and teachers in relation to individual students needs and in the development of whole school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.  </p>  <p>  Students facing homelessness may have the same emotional needs and learning needs as other students, but the immediacy of those needs is heightened.  NEPS supports the role of the school in identifying individual needs and at a systems level in the development of a culture and environment which supports connectedness and provides structure and stability, key elements which underpin learning and opportunity.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team provides a comprehensive programme of supports for teachers in the delivery of the SPHE curriculum where the issue of homelessness is dealt with under the "Myself and the Wider World&rdquo; strand.</p>  <p>  DEIS is the main policy initiative of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage.  DEIS Plan 2017 sets out my Department&rsquo;s vision for future intervention in this critical area of education policy.  Schools may use DEIS supports to meet the additional identified needs that may arise for pupils experiencing homelessness.</p></reply>

This has seen a significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places and this puts a high demand on the Department's capital budgets. Since 2011, some 340 major school projects and over 120,000 new and replacement places have been provided.</p><p>To meet this demographic challenge, my Department&rsquo;s Capital Investment Programme (2016-2021), details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process. The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified. Details of such funding approved in all schools, including those in County Kildare, is available on my Department's website which is updated regularly. </p><p>The current status of the 29 school building projects in County Kildare that are included on my Department's 6 Year Capital Programme is outlined in the table.</p><p><b>Capital Programme &ndash; Major projects being progressed</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Roll No</th><th>School Name</th><th>School type</th><th>Status</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>16706G</td><td>St Joseph&rsquo;s NS, Kilcock</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>70680U</td><td>St Conleth&rsquo;s VS, Newbridge</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Under construction</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>70700A</td><td>Maynooth Post Primary School</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Under construction</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>76193Q</td><td>New Maynooth Community College</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Under Construction</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>19277A</td><td>St Anne&rsquo;s Special School, The Curragh</td><td>Special School</td><td>Stage 2A</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>19675N</td><td>St Brigid&rsquo;s NS, Kilcullen</td><td>Primary</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>76194S</td><td>Naas Community College</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>76253I</td><td>Celbridge Community School</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>20257C</td><td>Scoil Naomh Padraig, Celbridge</td><td>Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>15957D</td><td>Rathangan BNS</td><td>Primary</td><td>Substantial completion</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>61702D</td><td>St Paul&rsquo;s Post-Primary School</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>15040T</td><td>Mercy Convent, Naas</td><td>Primary</td><td>Under construction</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>18288B</td><td>Scoil Mhichil Naofa, Athy</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>20428D</td><td>Gaelscoil Mhic Aodha, Kildare Town</td><td>Primary</td><td>Under construction</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>19796C</td><td>St Patrick&rsquo;s NS, Clane</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>15769C<br /><br />16707I</td><td>Scoil Eimhinn Naofa &amp;amp; St Peter&rsquo;s NS, Monasterevan</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>17341U</td><td>Maynooth BNS</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>17872F</td><td>St Conleth&rsquo;s &amp;amp; St Mary&rsquo;s, Newbridge</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>17873H</td><td>St Conleth&rsquo;s Infant School</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>17254C</td><td>St Corban&rsquo;s BNS</td><td>Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>18988G</td><td>St Raphael&rsquo;s Special School</td><td>Special School</td><td>Site required</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>19455W</td><td>St Mark&rsquo;s Special School, Newbridge</td><td>Special School</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>20292E</td><td>Maynooth ETNS</td><td>Primary</td><td>Stage 2(b)</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>61690W</td><td>Cross &amp;amp; Passion, Kilcullen</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>70650L</td><td>Athy Community College</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>70720G</td><td>St Farnan&rsquo;s Post-Primary School</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>13902O</td><td>Hewetson NS</td><td>Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>61681V</td><td>Patrician Post-Primary, Newbridge</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>61730I</td><td>St Mary&rsquo;s Girls Post-Primary School, Naas</td><td>Post-Primary</td><td>Early Architectural Planning</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Craft apprenticeships are generally four years in duration and consist of seven training phases, three phases off-the-job in an educational institution and four phases on-the-job with an approved SOLAS employer.  The off-the-job training phases can vary slightly depending on the apprenticeship, however, are generally up to 20 weeks during phase 2 and 10-11 weeks during phases 4 and 6.  </p>  <p>  Apprentices undertaking one of the recently developed consortia led apprenticeships are paid a salary by a SOLAS approved employer for the duration of their apprenticeship.  However, unlike the craft apprenticeships, these new apprenticeships are more flexible both in terms of the delivery of the off the job training and also in their duration, ranging from two to four years.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

All relevant considerations including the ongoing security situation in Libya and the potential economic impact of the restrictions were taken into account when these restriction were applied.</p>  <p>  There is provision for a small number of exceptions relating to the beef industry where applications may be accepted from persons who are known to and sponsored by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and/or An Bord Bia and who have a good travel history to Ireland, the UK or the Schengen countries.

To further this commitment, the Government has established an interdepartmental working group to develop proposals to give effect to the Programme commitments.  The key objectives of this group are to:</p>  <p>  - Develop options as to the duration of the leave, the age of the eligible child, and the level of payment to be offered;</p>  <p>  - Determine the usefulness of adopting a phased approach;</p>  <p>  - Estimate the likely costs arising; and </p>  <p>  - Align any proposals as much as possible with a European Commission Proposal for a Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers.</p>  <p>  The group is currently working on a policy approach and I expect it to report with its proposals at the end of April.  </p>  <p>  The move to introduce a paid parental leave entitlement is also in keeping with the policy approach put forward by the European Commission's proposal for a work-life balance directive, which is currently under discussion at working group level under the Bulgarian Presidency of the EU.  </p>  <p>  The specific objectives of the Directive are:</p>  <p>  - To improve access to work-life balance arrangements and; </p>  <p>  - To increase take-up of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements by men. </p>  <p>  The Directive&rsquo;s key proposal is that parental leave should be made available to parents on a paid basis.  This approach recognises that the provision of paid parental leave will be more effective and more appropriate in terms of encouraging fathers to share the caring role for their children. All the evidence shows that in parenting, what is best for children is the involvement of their fathers, in addition to their mothers, in their practical care and day to day lives.</p>  <p>  Given that discussions are on-going at EU level and the interdepartmental working group is not due to present its proposals until later this year, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be premature at this point to signify a precise timeframe for introducing any significant changes.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Deputies Roisin Shortall and Catherine Murphy have proposed a Private Members Bill, entitled Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2017, which provides for the extension of the existing entitlement to parental leave from 18 weeks leave to 26 weeks leave.  The Government decided not to oppose this Bill at Second Stage, which took place on 8 February 2018.</p>  <p>  I advised the House that I was available to discuss the proposal contained in the Bill with the sponsoring deputies.  The Bill has been referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality and I have strongly suggested that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality carry out a comprehensive legislative scrutiny on the Bill and on related issues in order to inform the debate and to allow interested stakeholders, groups and individuals to make submissions and to input to the legislative process.  I look forward to engaging in future discussions on the Bill in the context of the work that is ongoing in relation to expanding paid support to parents.  I have no current plans to increase the age of the qualifying child for parental leave from eight to 12 years of age, but this is an issue that can be explored within the context of the broader discussions on parental leave, and also in terms of the Family Leave Bill, which will consolidate and update family leave legislation.  </p></reply>

It provides insolvent borrowers who are at risk of losing their home with a range of free expert services and supports, including professional legal and financial advice and assistance, to help them identify and put in place solutions to their arrears, and wherever possible, to remain in their homes.  </p><p>Up to 19th of January 2018, Abhaile issued 7,983 vouchers for free professional financial advice and assistance from a personal insolvency practitioner, and 2,177 vouchers for free legal advice and assistance from a solicitor.  A substantial number of other borrowers were assisted under other free Abhaile services, including those receiving financial advice and assistance from Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Advisers working with MABS (the Money Advice and Budgeting Service), or helped by duty solicitors, or by MABS court mentors, in connection with repossession proceedings.</p><p>The legal advice and assistance services provided under Abhaile to distressed borrowers consist of three elements:</p><p>- A solicitor consultation service, which provides a single legal advice consultation to provide the borrower with independent legal advice on the borrower&rsquo;s best options for sustainable resolution of the mortgage arrears on their home;</p><p>- A duty solicitor service, which provides advice and assistance at county registrars&rsquo; courts to unrepresented borrowers who are defendants in repossession proceedings against their homes;</p><p>- A legal aid service for personal insolvency court reviews, which provides legal aid in connection with proceedings under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Acts (i.e, where a borrower wishes to seek a court review in circumstances where the creditors have rejected a proposal for a PIA). </p><p>It is understood that the Deputy&rsquo;s query relates to the consultation solicitor and duty solicitor services. </p><p><b>The solicitor consultation service</b></p><p>As at 19 January 2018, 2,177 borrowers had been issued legal advice vouchers under Abhaile. This voucher entitles the person to a free legal advice consultation with a solicitor.  The service provided by the solicitor entails:</p><p>- arranging a consultation with the borrower and taking instructions;</p><p>- checking the borrower&rsquo;s legal position, explaining it clearly to the borrower and answering his or her questions;</p><p>- advising the borrower on any related legal complications (for example, where a co-borrower is not cooperating in efforts to resolve the mortgage arrears);</p><p>- advising the borrower on any legal aspects of possible solutions, including solutions arising from financial advice and assistance provided under Abhaile; </p><p>- if the borrower is facing repossession proceedings, assessing whether the borrower appears to have a valid legal defence to those proceedings;</p><p>- explaining how to apply for civil legal aid to defend the proceedings, if the borrower appears to have a defence to repossession satisfying the merits criteria under sections 24 and 28 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995; </p><p>- if the borrower does not have a legal defence, informing the borrower about the Duty Solicitor Service available under Abhaile,  </p><p>- providing to the borrower, in writing, the legal advice given at the consultation(s), and providing a copy of that written advice to the borrower&rsquo;s Abhaile financial adviser.</p><p>A fixed fee of &euro;250 plus VAT is payable to the solicitor under Abhaile for providing the above service. There is no fee payable by the borrower.</p><p>In certain circumstances, the Legal Aid Board may, on application from the solicitor, grant the solicitor authority to continue to provide legal advice to the borrower, in the form of negotiating and concluding a solution with the mortgage lender.  In that case the solicitor will also hold a final consultation with the borrower and again confirm that advice in writing.  In such circumstances an additional fee of &euro;200+VAT is payable to the solicitor and again there is no fee payable by the borrower.</p><p>It should be noted that the solicitor consultation service is an &ldquo;advice only&rdquo; service.  It does not provide legal aid in connection with court proceedings, and it is not necessary that court proceedings have been issued before a person can avail of the service. For this reason, statistics on this service do not refer to court circuits. </p><p><b>The duty solicitor service</b></p><p>The duty solicitor service provides limited assistance in the County Registrars&rsquo; courts to unrepresented defendants facing repossession proceedings against their homes.  The service consists of providing advice and assistance to the borrower at the Courthouse, and includes:</p><p>- explaining clearly to the borrower their legal position regarding the repossession proceedings;</p><p>- answering his or her questions;</p><p>- speaking on the borrower&rsquo;s behalf in Court;</p><p>- seeking an adjournment and/or settlement of the proceedings in favour of the borrower. </p><p>The Duty Solicitor service does not require a voucher.  The borrower does not have to have already seen an Abhaile adviser: it may assist if they have, as the duty solicitor can be provided in advance with a copy of the consultation solicitor's written legal advice.  In practice, most borrowers helped by a Duty Solicitor have not previously sought legal advice - however, the Duty Solicitor or the MABS Court Mentor present at court can refer them for further help under Abhaile. </p><p>The figures that follow show the number of sittings in each Circuit Court circuit for which a duty solicitor has been, or is scheduled to be, provided, in the period between September 2016 and the end of March 2018 (end of the current Courts term).<table><tr><th>Circuit</th><th>No of court dates </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Eastern</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>Midland</td><td>156</td></tr><tr><td>Northern</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>South  Eastern </td><td>185</td></tr><tr><td>South  Western </td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Western</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>835 </td></tr></table></p><p>Under Abhaile, a duty solicitor is rostered to attend court on a date when the County Registrar is scheduled to deal with repossession cases, and is then available to assist unrepresented borrowers attending that sitting.  The duty solicitor is paid a fixed fee of &euro;250+VAT for attending a half day sitting and &euro;350+VAT for attending a full day sitting, irrespective of the number of borrowers assisted. (The overwhelming majority of duty solicitor services are paid at the half day rate).  There is no fee payable by the borrower.</p><p>Comprehensive figures are not available for all borrowers helped by Duty Solicitors under Abhaile.  However, at least 3,340 unrepresented borrowers have been assisted by duty solicitors at repossession court lists around the country to date. </p></reply>

We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 80 have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Kildare Division.</p><p>The investment in personnel I have outlined is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.</p><p>In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information the following tables set out the number of Garda&iacute; attached to the Kildare Division on 31 December 2017 and the number of Garda vehicles allocated to the Kildare Divisional fleet as of 14 February 2018.</p><p><b>Kildare Divisional Fleet as on 14 February 2018</b><table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th colspan="2"><div>Cars</div></th><th colspan="2"><div>Vans</div></th><th rowspan="2"><div>Motorcycles</div></th><th rowspan="2"><div>4 x 4</div></th><th rowspan="2"><div>Others</div></th><th rowspan="2"><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>Marked</div></td><td><div>Unmarked</div></td><td><div>Marked</div></td><td><div>Unmarked</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>KILDARE DISTRICT</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>LEIXLIP DISTRICT</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>NAAS DISTRICT</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>DIVISIONAL TOTAL</div></td><td><div>23</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>59</div></td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="8"><div>STRENGTH OF THE KILDARE DIVISION 31 DECEMBER 2017</div></th></tr><tr><td>DISTRICT</td><td>STATION</td><td><div>GD</div></td><td><div>SG</div></td><td><div>IN</div></td><td><div>SU</div></td><td><div>CS</div></td><td><div>TOTAL</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>ATHY</td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>30</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEDERMOT</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILDARE</td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONASTEREVIN</td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWBRIDGE</td><td><div>46</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHANGAN</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>111</div></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td><div>132</div></td></tr><tr><td>LEIXLIP</td><td>CARBURY</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CELBRIDGE</td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCOCK</td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LEIXLIP</td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td><div>59</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYNOOTH</td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>85</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td><div>100</div></td></tr><tr><td>NAAS</td><td>CLANE</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCULLEN</td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NAAS</td><td><div>100</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>118</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROBERTSTOWN</td><td><div>2</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>109</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>128</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE TOTAL</td><td></td><td><div>305</div></td><td><div>45</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>360</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with no new recruits attesting from 2011 to 2014.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow the deployment of increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format requested, as resources are assigned on a Divisional basis which does not necessarily accord to county boundaries.  For the Deputy's information I have set out the number of new Garda recruits by Division in each of the years 2010, 2015, 2016 and 2017, in tabular form.  There were no Garda trainees attested in 2011-2014.</p><p>Probationer Garda&iacute; Allocations by Division 2010-2017<table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>2010</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

A member has the option of continuing to serve until they reach 60 years of age subject to the Garda Commissioner being satisfied that the member is fully competent and available to undertake, and fully capable of undertaking, the duties of his or her position as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>I have set out for the Deputy's information the number of departures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the years 2010 to 2017 in tabular form as supplied by the Commissioner.  These figures include those who departed due to voluntary, compulsory, or cost neutral early retirement, resignation, death, dismissal and medical discharge.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that projected departures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are kept under continuing review and the level of recruitment adjusted as necessary in order to achieve the desired strength.<table><tr><th colspan="10">DEPARTURES from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na 2010-2017</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Com</td><td>D/Com</td><td>AC</td><td>C/Supt</td><td>Supt</td><td>Insp</td><td>Sgt</td><td>Garda</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>20</td><td>72</td><td>169</td><td>282</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>16</td><td>64</td><td>170</td><td>263</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>83</td><td>169</td><td>282</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>83</td><td>180</td><td>291</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>13</td><td>91</td><td>211</td><td>335</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>19</td><td>24</td><td>119</td><td>294</td><td>462</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>23</td><td>19</td><td>109</td><td>318</td><td>480</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>8</td><td>100</td><td>279</td><td>407</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality is currently working on updating the General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill.</p>  <p>  Video and computer games, whether in online or other form, are subject to the provisions of general consumer protection legislation.  The Consumer Protection Act 2007 (which gives effect to Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices) contains provisions of general application on unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices that may be relevant in some cases to video and computer games.  The European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 (which give effect to Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in contracts) apply similarly to consumer contracts for video and consumer games.  The information requirements of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (which give effect to Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights) apply to consumer contracts for video and computer games as, subject to certain specified exceptions, does the right of consumers under the Regulations to cancel an online contract for video or computer games within 14 days of delivery of the goods in the case of games supplied in tangible form or of the conclusion of the contract in the case of games supplied in digital form.  The Regulations do not apply however to contracts for gambling, defined as &ldquo;wagering a stake with pecuniary value in games of chance, including lotteries, casino games and betting transactions.&rdquo;  If the Deputy has reason to believe that video and computer games are in breach of any of the above-mentioned legislation, I suggest that she provide details to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission which has responsibility for their enforcement.</p>  <p>  In June 2016, the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed a General Approach on a proposed Directive on contracts for the supply of digital content, including digital games.  The proposed Directive is currently the subject of trilogue discussions involving the European Council, Commission and Parliament.  It deals with matters such as the supply of digital content, its conformity with the contract in respect of a wide range of requirements including quality, functionality, compatibility, interoperability, fitness for normal purposes, fitness for any particular purpose made known by the consumer, and updates.  The General Approach also sets out the remedies available to consumers where digital content does not comply with these requirements.  It excludes from the scope of the Directive gambling services, defined as &ldquo;services which involve wagering a skill with pecuniary value in games of chance, including those with an element of skill, such as lotteries, casino games, poker games and betting transactions, by electronic means or any other technology for facilitating communication and the individual request of a recipient of a service.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  In general, these consumer protection measures aim to protect the economic interests of consumers and do not deal with matters such as age rating and the protection of minors.</p></reply>

However some Government initiatives have been introduced in order to ensure that SMEs obtain appropriate finance in order to sustain and grow their business.  </p><p>In the event that this business has made a formal application to one of the main banks and has been refused, the first possibility is to appeal that decision to the Credit Review Office.  This Office was established to provide a simple and effective review process for SMEs refused credit from the main banks, or where the SME considers that the terms or conditions attached to a credit facility or its price are so onerous as to amount to a constructive refusal.</p><p>While the Office has no statutory or regulatory powers to overturn bank lending decisions, it has been the experience to date that if the lending could have been made within acceptable risk boundaries, the bank will be required to comply with this recommendation, or to explain why it will not do so.  To date, all banks have respected and complied with the Credit Review Office recommendations.  It is important to note that you must make a formal loan application and have been refused before you can refer the matter to the Credit Review Office, which can be contacted at Tel: 1850 211 789 or online at <i><i>www.creditreview.ie</i></i>.</p><p>Again, in the event that a loan has or is likely to be refused, a second possibility is the Credit Guarantee Scheme under Minister Humphrey&rsquo;s remit.  These are cases where the Minister shares with the bank a large part of the risk involved in the loan to an SME.  This is exclusively targeted at SMEs that are unable to access credit because of these two particular market failures in operation, (i) the inadequacy of SME collateral and, (ii) the inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology that the SME is involved in. </p><p>The first step towards availing of a credit guarantee would be for you to ask the bank that has refused you lending (the 3 main banks AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank all participate in the Schemes), to request this avenue of funding, a process that would continue with the bank in question assessing the company&rsquo;s viability under alternative arrangements before making a decision.  Further information on the Credit Guarantee Scheme is available at: <i><i></i></i></p><p>Furthermore a wide list of over 100 possible Government supports is available online from the online tool available at </p><p><i><i> </i></i>and I would encourage the business to review this portal to establish the various potential supports available in the circumstances.</p></reply>

I have just published the output from this independent research in a report entitled "Ireland and the Impact of Brexit: Strategic Implications for Ireland Arising from Changing EU-UK Trading Relations".  This research project adds to an already extensive evidence base that underpins the ongoing development of our response to Brexit. </p>  <p>  Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this study quantifies the impact on the economy of possible new barriers to trade in goods and services which might emerge as a result of Brexit.  This provides an evidence base on key trade and investment questions to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.  It will also help to inform domestic policy responses and measures necessary to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities arising as a result of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The study models for a range of short and long term impacts of Brexit on key economic metrics, including GDP, exports, imports and wage rates.  The main focus of the study is on the long term to show the possible impact of four Brexit scenarios in a putative &ldquo;year 2030&rdquo;.  All results are compared against a 2030 baseline which would have pertained had Brexit not occurred. These scenarios are:</p>  <p>  - An EEA-type scenario</p>  <p>  - A Customs Union scenario </p>  <p>  - A Free Trade Agreement</p>  <p>  - A (worst-case) WTO scenario  </p>  <p>  All of the scenarios examined produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario.  Nevertheless, regardless of the scenario, the Irish economy is still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030 &ndash; Brexit has a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. </p>  <p>  The study points to the fact that negotiating the best possible outcome will be the most effective mitigation measure in terms of limiting the damage of Brexit to Ireland.  It also identifies the importance of progressing EU FTAs with other key trading partners.   </p>  <p>  Copenhagen Economics find that while the overall impact of Brexit will be negative for Ireland, there are certain opportunities arising from these changes.  Copenhagen Economic grouped these opportunities into three categories: Trade, talent and investment. </p>  <p>  As a result of Brexit, UK exporters will face new barriers in the EU market. This implies that UK products or services will be more expensive in the EU market, meaning that customers in other EU countries currently served by UK firms will be looking for alternative suppliers.  This can present opportunities for Irish exporters, especially since there are many overlaps in the products export from the UK and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  In terms of talent, the expected decline in economic activity in the UK following Brexit and in particular the uncertainty and sentiment of EU citizens in the UK presents another opportunity for Ireland.  As the only English speaking country in the EU, aside from Malta, and with diverse job opportunities, Ireland can become a new home for talents deciding to leave the UK post-Brexit. This would particularly relevant in sectors and positions where there are already shortages in Ireland.  This could include IT-specialists, researchers, financial service expert for example. </p>  <p>  Copenhagen Economics find that the biggest opportunities in relation to Brexit arise from increased foreign direct investment (FDI).  Our country&rsquo;s attractiveness to overseas companies is well-documented and will likely increase on account of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, as some firms consider alternative locations for future investment. Ireland has, in fact, already seen both increased investment and interest from multinational businesses &ndash; particularly in the financial services sector &ndash; in the wake of the EU-UK referendum result and further Brexit-related FDI is expected in the time ahead. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland continues to identify potential for mobile FDI in key sectors and actively pursue these opportunities including through targeted trade missions and rollout of advertising campaigns to promote Ireland&rsquo;s offering particularly in talent and tax.</p>  <p>  Overall, this independent research complements the Department&rsquo;s recently published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; report which summarises the policy measures that DBEI has already taken, those that are planned and the Departmental structural reforms put in place to ensure that we can work as efficiently and effectively as possible to support our companies.</p></reply>

However, actual expenditure was higher at &euro;533,995 due to the allocation of additional funding by my Department during 2017.</p><p>In 2018 the HSA has allocated approximately &euro;624,000 for farm safety initiatives. The actual figure expended might vary during the year in response to particular issues that arise in this or other sectors.  These initiatives will involve the organisation of, participation in, or support of a wide range of agriculture related events as well as media coverage. The Authority will also engage in a number of targeted promotional campaigns through relevant media. </p><p>In 2018 the HSA is also carrying out three focused inspection campaigns each of one-month duration. The first focuses on Livestock Handling and is currently under way. The second campaign on Farm Vehicle Safety will take place in May and the third on Maintenance and Working at a Height will take place in October. As well these specific campaigns other national campaigns related to vehicle and construction safety will have relevance to the farming sector.</p><p>In addition to specific farm safety initiatives or inspections visits to farms by inspectors include routine unannounced inspections to monitor compliance with a range health and safety regulations and to investigate farm accidents. In any one year there can be between 60-90 investigations on farms with the rest being unannounced inspections. </p><p>The planned target of farm inspections was significantly increased in 2010 from 1,500 per year to 3,000 and its impact assessed over the following 5 year period. However, the increased level of inspection showed no significant reduction in farm deaths. </p><p>Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources toward engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives. Research has shown that farmers working in peer to peer groups, such as Knowledge Transfer Groups take on new information, new procedures, and new technology more easily and make more lasting changes in the way they farm when involved with such groups. The objective is to bring about sustainable changes to work practices and controlling risk.</p><p>The reduction of farm inspection numbers from a target of 3,000 to 2,000 for 2018 is a planned strategy by the HSA to allow its team of farm inspectors to offer strong support to the Knowledge Transfer Groups. During 2017 HSA inspectors were involved with over 100 such Groups, in addition to farm walks, thereby reaching a further 2,000 farmers through such engagements. The use of Knowledge Transfer Groups will continue in 2018.</p><p>In addition, the HSA recently completed a recruitment campaign for 11 inspector posts, 6 of which are field inspection posts and have now been filled. These 6 inspectors will be involved in future farm inspection campaigns thereby helping to ensure that farm inspection targets will be achieved.</p><p>Table of Expenditure on Farm Safety Initiatives 2011 to 2017<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure *</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;264,000 **</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;264,481</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;589,870</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;449,669</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;327,953</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;396,251</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;416,917</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;533,995</td></tr><tr><td>2018 (estimated)</td><td>&euro;624,000</td></tr></table></p><p><i>*Note: Annual figures for expenditure include some cross sectorial initiatives where the expenditure is also relevant to other sectors.

One of the primary policy objectives of the Bill is to reduce alcohol consumption to 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per person per annum by 2020. This equates to a 20 % reduction of the 2016 consumption figure of 11.46 litres. </p><p>The remaining policy objective are to:</p><p>- delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people; </p><p>- reduce the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol; and</p><p>- regulate the supply and price of alcohol in order to minimise the possibility and incidence of alcohol related harm.</p><p>These objectives were developed in recognition that alcohol causes harms to health, significant costs to the Exchequer and that alcohol consumption in Ireland remains high. </p><p>The principles guiding the objectives are that the harms of alcohol make it unlike other grocery products, that consumers should be able to make informed choices about their drinking and that it is time that children and young people&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol was addressed. </p><p>Research carried out by the University of Sheffield on behalf of the Department of Health indicates that both Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) and promotion ban policies are effective at improving alcohol related health outcomes. The estimated impact of a 10 cent MUP as set out in the Bill, indicates that among high risk drinkers alcohol attributable deaths per 100,000 drinkers will reduce by 69 per year and among low risk drinkers, alcohol attributable deaths per 100,000 drinkers will reduce by 1 per year.  </p><p>In terms of hospital admissions, there would be an estimated 5,878 fewer alcohol attributable admissions each year for high risk drinker groups. The annual rate of alcohol attributable admissions per 100,000 drinkers is estimated to reduce by 1,964 for high risk drinkers and by 28 for low risk drinkers. The majority of these gains are in improved chronic disease outcomes, particularly alcoholic liver disease.</p></reply>

When the 2-year transitional period ends in September 2018 entitlement to use the title of physiotherapist will be confined to members of the register.  </p>  <p>In many countries around the world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is also used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who have been providing musculoskeletal therapies in the private sector for many years.  Physiotherapists are trained to provide musculoskeletal, cardio/respiratory and neurological therapies, working in both the public and private sector.  In December last year I made regulations to prescribe the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist.  The protection of the title will eliminate the ongoing risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety.  The effect of prescribing the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist will be to protect both titles under the Health and Social Care Professional Council 2005 Act by confining their use solely to registrants of the profession of physiotherapist and to permit the registration in the register of physiotherapists, on a once-off basis and for a limited period, of qualified users of the title of physical therapist.</p>  <p>  Athletic Rehabilitation Therapists are one of a growing number of aspirant professions seeking regulation by the Health and Social Care Professional Council (CORU).  Section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professional Council 2005 Act provides that the Minister for Health may, following a consultation process and with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, make regulations designating a health or social care profession not already designated if the Minister considers it in the public interest to do so. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the registration boards of all of the designated professions will be established by the end of 2018.  With my recent decision to designate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist, CORU will be responsible for the regulation of 16 health and social care professions. </p>  <p>  CORU will then be asked to undertake a risk assessment, in terms of public protection, of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation under the Act and to make recommendations concerning options for their possible future regulation. The question of designating other professions providing musculoskeletal therapies, including the profession of athletic rehabilitation therapist will be considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 250 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 60% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  Assets include cash assets and  all forms of property whether situated in the State or not.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence (PPR) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  In that regard the PPR is treated differently than other assets, including, for example, a second property.</p><p>The financial assessment of relevant assets held, including an individual's PPR, is undertaken as a means of assessing the individual's future contribution to the cost of care under the Scheme.  It is important to note that participants in the Scheme are not required to transfer ownership of assets, including the PPR, to other parties including the State.</p></reply>

The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a recommendation was made to examine the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  I am committed to this review.  However, it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  The Department has recently received this advice and are exploring the legislative changes necessary and any potential impacts as a result of amending the scheme.  It is hoped to bring a Memo to Government on this issue shortly and, subject to Government approval and the drafting process, I then hope to bring forward these legislative proposals thereafter.</p></reply>

The regulation and role of dental hygienists is being examined in the context of this new legislation.  </p>  <p>  A Regulatory Impact Analysis is currently underway, and the drafting of the Scheme of Bill, which is the next step in the process to develop the new legislation, has commenced, but it is at an early stage.  It is therefore too early to give an indication as to when the Bill will be published and debated.   Department officials are currently committed to drafting a priority Regulated Health Professions (Amendment) Bill, the primary purpose of which is to amend all health professional regulatory Acts as a consequence of the transposition of the Modernised Professional Qualifications Directive (2013/55/EU), and to address a number of other issues.  </p>  <p>  While the development of new dental legislation is a priority for me, work on the preparation of the Dental Bill will be progressed in line with competing legislative priorities.</p></reply>

The National Plan set out the projected infrastructure and equipment required to meet the needs for radiation oncology over a 20 year period. </p>  <p>  Radiation oncology is available in five public hospitals: St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital Rathgar (which three together form the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network, Dublin), Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway. Radiation oncology services for public patients are also provided in two private facilities in Waterford and Limerick under the aegis of Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway respectively. Meanwhile, patients from the North West can receive radiation oncology treatment at the North West Cancer Centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry.</p>  <p>  The model of care for radiation oncology allows for the sufficient volume and concentration of activity and expertise to facilitate high quality radiation oncology treatments in line with best evidence and international best practice. Modern radiation oncology is increasingly complex. Delivery of such complex care requires several key components to ensure safe, high quality radiation therapy. These include appropriate physical infrastructure and equipment to meet the needs of both patients and staff, a highly trained multidisciplinary team including specialist doctors, nurses, radiation therapists, physicists and other health and social care professionals and a system of quality assurance that can ensure that radiation oncology services are safe, effective, equitable, efficient, timely and centred on the patients needs. </p>  <p>  Future planned developments for radiation oncology services include the construction of new and upgraded facilities in Galway and Cork and the expansion of the facility in Beaumont. In line with the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 and the National Plan for Radiation Oncology, it is not intended to establish a centre for radiation oncology in the Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes. In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes. The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 250 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 60% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

This reflected the untested nature of the North American species being planted at the time. From the 1950s onwards confidence in Sitka spruce and Lodgepole pine grew, leading to their dominance in afforestation up to the mid-90s, after which the role of Lodgepole pine declined, reflecting primarily the improved land quality available for afforestation after this period and the generally poor form of the species. </p><p>From 2006 to 2010 the species composition of afforestation remained largely stable. However the finding of Phytophthora ramorum in Japanese larch in 2010, led to its withdrawal from the afforestation programme. From the mid-90s onwards a wider range of tree species has been planted, with ash and oak dominating broadleaf planting. However, more recently, the fungal disease Chalara fraxinea was found in ash in 2012, resulting in the cessation of grant aid for this species.  Sitka spruce remains the predominant species used in Irish forestry. It has proven to be one of the most productive conifers in Ireland and as such has become the mainstay in roundwood processing. According to the National Forest Inventory 2012 Sitka spruce is the most common tree species in Ireland, occupying 52.4% of the total forest area.</p><p>The information sought is not currently prepared in the format requested. However, it is possible to provide similar data that will give an indication of the composition of Ireland&rsquo;s forests as regards Sitka spruce.  The total area of Sitka spruce in each county is presented in the following table. </p><p>Sitka spruce<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Area (ha)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>3,494</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>6,946</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>26,919</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>47,078</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>31,102</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>2,243</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>27,593</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>27,070</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>1,023</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>8,989</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>12,013</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>14,138</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>16,322</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1,470</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>405</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>19,413</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>439</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1,931</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>5,554</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>12,573</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>10,837</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>20,290</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>12,584</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1,739</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>4,714</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>17,683</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>334,564</td></tr></table></p><p>According to the National Forest Inventory (NFI) 2012, the following table represents the total area of Sitka spruce above the age of 30.</p><p>Sitka spruce<table><tr><th>Age Class</th><th>Area (ha)</th></tr><tr><td>31-40</td><td>42,480</td></tr><tr><td>41-50</td><td>16,060</td></tr><tr><td>51+</td><td>2,150</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Regulation included an amendment to EU Regulation 1307/2013 regarding the number of years a successful applicant under the Young Farmers Scheme (YFS) can receive payment.  The relevant amendment is in two parts.  The first part of the regulatory amendment provides that YFS applicants may receive payment for five years starting from the first submission of an application for payment, provided that the application takes place within five years of the commencement of farming.  This period of five years also applies to farmers who had received payment under the scheme in respect of applications prior to 2018.  The second part of the regulatory amendment provides that it is optional for Member States to extend the provision to young farmers who set up a holding in the period 2010-2013, and who had received payment under the YFS in respect of applications before the 2018 scheme year.</p>  <p>  Ireland has applied the maximum 2% of the national ceiling to create a YFS fund of &euro;24 million annually.  Ireland has also utilised the option to overestimate the BPS ceiling in order to take account of unused YFS funds and this funding was used to allocate entitlements to young farmers and new entrants under the 2017 National Reserve.  Therefore the allocation of &euro;24 million is fully utilised in Ireland.  If Ireland opted to implement just the first part of the amended regulatory provision it would result in a windfall gain for some Young Farmers Scheme applicants who had commenced farming between 2010 and 2013 and who have already received payment based on the regulatory provisions applying at the time.  It is estimated that the additional cost of implementing just the first part of the regulatory amendment in Ireland would be in excess of &euro;5.5 million in 2018 and &euro;7.5 million in 2019 which would result in a requirement for a linear cut to all farmers&rsquo; basic payments in order to fund this additional spend under the Young Farmers Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is for this reason that Ireland will implement the relevant regulatory amendment of Regulation 2017/2393 in full.  This will provide for a situation where with effect from the 2018 scheme year, successful applicants under the Young Farmers Scheme who commenced farming from 2014 onwards and submit their first YFS application within five years of commencement of farming may receive payment under the YFS for five years.  </p></reply>

In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom &ldquo;will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 (Good Friday) Agreement.&rdquo;  Such arrangements would require regulatory alignment in those areas of sanitary and phytosanitary rules subject to official control checks at the point of import. </p>  <p>  Work is now ongoing to ensure that these principles and commitments are reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement, which will be legally binding.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to working closely with the Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is the lead Department in this area, to ensure that the supply of domestic fuels available in the forest and agriculture sectors are mobilised to support energy generation from a range of bioenergy technologies.  Anaerobic Digestion is one of the technologies included for support in the proposed Support Scheme for Renewable Heat announced by my colleague Minister Naughten late last year. </p>  <p>  My Department, under a previous Development Plan, included a pilot scheme funding the installation of anaerobic digesters on ten Irish Farms.  Two projects were completed and a further project has been given extensions to undertake the work by mid 2018, with the extension for a further project currently being considered.   While the pilot scheme was not extended, the current Rural Development Programme is directly targeted at supporting environmental actions to assist farmers in meeting climate change responsibilities.  The RDP 2014 -2020 will deliver funding of some &euro;4 billion to the agricultural sector and rural areas generally over the lifetime of the Programme.  The Programme&rsquo;s content and design was formulated in light of previous experience and performance and reflects the outcome of extensive stakeholder consultation.  Examples of environmental actions supported in the RDP include supports for Renewable Heat technologies in the form of supports for biomass boilers under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme (PPIS) and the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme (YFCIS).  Air-source heat pumps are also supported under PPIS and YFCIS schemes and they may be used as part of a water heater under the Dairy Equipment Scheme.  Grant aid is also available under PPIS and YFCIS schemes for solar panels used for electricity production (photovoltaic) and water heating that are permanently erected to buildings used for pig, poultry and egg production.</p>  <p>  In terms of future policy, I opened a public consultation process on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post 2020 on Friday 26 January 2018 for an eight week period and am also holding a series of six public meetings to consider the future of the CAP.  These submissions and views will play an important role in feeding into the Irish position in the negotiations to come.</p></reply>

In this regard, waste management plans for the Connacht-Ulster, Eastern Midlands and Southern Regions were made in May 2015.  The plans comprehensively set out clear strategies, policies and actions to address the prevention, generation, collection and management of waste in the State for the period 2015 to 2021.  The development and implementation of the plans will give effect to national and EU waste management policies and legislation.</p><p>European, national and regional waste policy are all predicated on the management of waste in line with the waste hierarchy, whereby the prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery of waste are preferred (in that order) to the disposal of waste.  For instance, collectors of waste must conduct their activities in accordance with the relevant legislation and the conditions of their waste collection permits which, <i>inter alia,</i>require that waste is managed in line with the waste hierarchy. </p><p>The Government's policy of increasing the landfill levy to its current level of &euro;75 per tonne has provided a real financial incentive for waste operators to divert as much material as possible from disposal at landfill.  The success of the above and many other policy and legislative measures, including the National Waste Prevention Programme and the phasing-out of flat rate fees for household waste collection, which encourage waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery, has meant that more waste can be put to environmentally sustainable and productive use as opposed to being buried in the ground. </p><p>Statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling and recovery rates and reducing our reliance on landfill.  In this regard, National Waste Statistics are available to download at <i></i><i>/</i>including the State's progress in meeting targets under EU waste legislation including the Waste Framework Directive; the Landfill Directive; and the Producer Responsibility Directives (Packaging, End-of-Life Vehicles, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, Batteries and Accumulators).  Of particular note is the reduction in the disposal (landfill) rate of managed Municipal Solid Waste, which fell from 41% in 2012 to 21% in 2014.</p></reply>

The hazardous waste industry in Ireland is owned and operated by the private sector and no public authorities are involved in the commercial collection of hazardous waste, the provision of storage facilities or the treatment of hazardous waste.  The only exception is the provision of civic amenity sites by local authorities for the deposit of small quantities of household hazardous waste.</p><p>The three Regional Waste Management Plans note the need identified by the EPA in the NHWMP for up to 277,000 tonnes of disposal capacity for hazardous waste materials over the period 2014-2020.  The Regional Waste Management Plans highlight that the EPA recognises the value of developing existing landfill sites, including those which are currently closed or un-commenced, for the development of certain hazardous wastes.Accordingly the Regional Waste Management Plans, <i>inter alia</i>, support the development of disposal capacity for the treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes at existing landfill facilities, subject to the appropriate statutory approvals being granted in line with the appropriate environmental criteria.  The plans do not contain measures requiring the Regions to provide for this waste.</p><p>Ireland currently has no dedicated hazardous waste landfill disposal facility and there is no facility for the treatment of thermal residue in the State.  While landfill is the least favoured option on the waste hierarchy, it is recognised that relying on the current export model to address this need poses risks for long term availability of outlets.  Any proposals for hazardous waste management infrastructure would be expected to have regard to the National Hazardous Waste Management Plan and describe how the overarching objectives of the plan would be met.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-15a.701.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018021500070#WRW01300"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the National Transport Authority's (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades. Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy. The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  In 2015, Dublin City Council and the NTA jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre. Those two bodies, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and TII, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city. Over the last six months, changes have been made throughout the city centre to accommodate the introduction of new Luas services. The most significant changes were the introduction of the additional bus lanes along the North and South Quays last August.  In addition, a host of other junction and traffic signal changes has been implemented.  In the case of College Green - and in advance of a determination of a proposal for a civic plaza at College Green developed by City Council - the NTA, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council, have proceeded to reduce bus vehicle volumes passing through the area, which would allow the junctions and signals to function more effectively. These parties continue to keep the situation under review.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport I have secured increased funding for both public transport services and infrastructure in Budget 2018 which will allow us to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system across our cities including Dublin. This includes an 8% increase in funding for PSO services across the bus and rail networks in 2018 to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable public transport services. </p>  <p>  Following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan, Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for Ireland's public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021. This substantial multi-annual envelope will allow investment in a number of key programmes to increase capacity on our public transport network, ease congestion and provide an alternative to private car use. This includes funding of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to fundamentally transform Dublin&rsquo;s bus system, so that journeys for bus passengers will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable. Over &euro;685 million capital investment will also be provided for additional rail infrastructure between now and 2021 to provide additional Luas capacity, improve mainline rail infrastructure and progress DART expansion and new Metro North. </p></reply>

In November and December last, Minister Ross and I announced &euro;60m in allocations to a record 1,800 projects under the round.  Full details of all of these allocations are available on my Department's website.   </p>  <p>  In relation to invalid applications, several improvements were introduced for the 2017 programme to improve the application process. Measures included a significantly shortened application form, more on-line validation of applications and the hosting of a series or regional seminars for potential applicants. These measures were generally successful with the proportion of invalid applications falling from over one third in previous rounds to one fifth in 2017. </p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the allocations, all applicants that were deemed invalid or partially invalid were invited to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision if it was felt than an error had been made in the assessment process.  The deadline for the submission of appeals from applicants for local projects was 20 December 2017 and in relation to regional projects the deadline was 19 January 2018.  149 appeals were submitted prior to the deadline and decisions on these submissions are now being finalised.  Decisions in relation to how to redress any successful appeals, including funding for same, will be taken once this work is complete and I expect that all applicants will be informed of the outcome of their appeal in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department is undertaking a more general review of the 2017 round of the programme including all invalid applications where incorrect or incomplete documentation was submitted.

It will  prioritise key investment actions to progress new key capital transport programmes and projects over the period to 2027 and that will be subject to the relevant appraisal processes and value for money tests as required under the Public Spending Code.  In line with the recommendations of my Department's 2015 Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport, a continuing key priority for investment in transport under the NDP will be to protect the quality and value of the existing extensive rail networks, including the areas referenced by the Deputy, to ensure quality levels of service, accessibility and connectivity.  Prioritisation of this type of investment is also a key finding of a recent Public Investment Management Assessment which was conducted by the International Monetary Fund at the invitation of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority's (NTA) &ldquo;Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) 2016-2035&rdquo; provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA over the next two decades.  The DART Expansion Programme which is a cornerstone project of the strategy, seeks to progress a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected to provide fast, high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda on the Northern Line, Celbridge/Hazelhatch on the Kildare Line, Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth/Sligo Line, while continuing to provide DART services on the South-Eastern Line as far south as Greystones.  While it currently does not envisage electrification of existing rail services beyond these destinations, it is subject to review in 2021.</p></reply>

The effect of the living alone allowance is to increase the rate of payment to such people, recognizing that there are economies of scale associated with living with another person. In relation to the qualifying criteria for a medical card, this is under the remit of the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  These secondary payments are in some cases subject to a means or household composition test.  A person does not have to live alone to receive fuel allowance or HHB, however they must only live with certain excepted people or someone who is in receipt of a qualifying payment in their own right. In the case of HHB a person aged 70 or over is not subject to a means or household composition test.</p>  <p>  Significant costs would arise if the criteria for these schemes were relaxed to allow persons in under occupied houses to accept tenants without affecting their secondary entitlements.  There would also, clearly, be significant administrative challenges in determining whether such co-residents of pensioners would in fact become homeless if they could not reside at the pensioner&rsquo;s address.   </p>  <p>  While a pensioner allowing another person to live with them might reduce such additional allowances previously held by the householder, the economies of scale from living together should mean that a weekly contribution by the person moving in would more than compensate for any such reduction in payments from my Department. </p>  <p>  The criteria for the Department&rsquo;s supplementary schemes are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  The guidelines for supplementary schemes are kept under review.  However, any decision to change the requirement for these schemes would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

One of the PRSI conditions is that a person must have a minimum of 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year. Claims made in 2018 are governed by the 2016 tax year and only PRSI Classes A, E, H, and P, are reckonable for Illness Benefit purposes.</p><p>The person concerned made a claim to Illness Benefit and this claim was registered in my Department on 9 January 2018. According to my Department&rsquo;s records the person concerned does not have the required amount of contributions for the 2016 year.</p><p>However, the person concerned indicated on the application form that they had contributions in the United Kingdom. This record was requested by my Department on 30 January 2018. Unfortunately, these requests take approximately 3-4 months.

The scheme is funded from the social insurance fund.</p>  <p>  Up to 2011, the scheme provided a rebate of 60 per cent to employers who provided statutory redundancy payments to their employees.  In Budgets 2012 and 2013, the Government first reduced and then abolished the rebate payment.  This decision was made because of the high cost of the rebate and its impact on the financial sustainability of the social insurance fund at the time of the economic crisis.  Furthermore, the rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, thus benefitting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies. It was not a targeted use of the resources of the social insurance fund. </p>  <p>  The redundancy payments scheme as it now operates benefits employees whose employers are unable to pay for statutory redundancy.  Employers who declare they cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments, albeit they continue to trade, are required to submit documentation from their accountants or solicitors and to accept liability for the redundancy payment to the social insurance fund.  This ensures that the current scheme takes into account both an employer&rsquo;s ability to pay redundancy payments and that the social insurance fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if their financial position improves.</p>  <p>  A rebate of redundancy payments to smaller businesses would discriminate between employers and may be construed as a form of state aid, as rebates are not the norm in EU member states. Restoring the rebate would lead to higher costs for the social insurance fund and could restrict the scope for expanding social protection coverage, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.   </p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the contribution made by small businesses in the creation of employment, I do not consider it appropriate to reinstate the rebate scheme on any basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The main purpose of these changes, which were implemented in July 2017 was to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme. </p>  <p>  One of the general eligibility requirements to participate on CE is that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment from my Department for a minimum period of 12 months. People who do not qualify for a social welfare payment do not meet the current eligibility requirements for participation on CE.  However, such people may be eligible for other programmes or support to help them return to work, for example VTOS courses provided by ETB&rsquo;s, Skillnet courses funded through the Department of Education and Skills or Momentum courses provided by SOLAS.

This includes the achievement of energy efficiency, the implementation of planned maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs and pre-letting repairs. Regarding the number of houses that are owned by local authorities, the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC), in their annual reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities, publishes a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including the total number of dwellings in each local authority area. The most recent NOAC report containing this information shows almost 130,000 homes provided directly by Local Authorities and is available at the following link: <i>. </i></p><p>My Department is currently supporting local authorities in undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting which commenced in 2013. The aim of the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme is the improvement of energy efficiency and comfort levels in local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy efficiency targets for 2020. </p><p>The programme is being implemented in a number of phases: Phase 1 is focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties, while Phase 2, which has been piloted in both Fingal and Westmeath County Councils, will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction. </p><p>My Department is providing grant funding of &euro;3,500 per unit under Phase 1 and from &euro;14,650 for mid-terrace to &euro;17,650 for end-terrace units under Phase 2. The grant limits available under Phase 2 represent the more comprehensive suite of works, and includes a provision to upgrade poorly performing windows and doors in specific circumstances. </p><p>Funding of some &euro;115.7 million has been provided from 2013 to the end-2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000 local authority homes. In 2018, the main focus of the available funding for the Programme will be on the completion of the remaining Phase 1 works and formally rolling out Phase 2.

There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner. Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats (especially woodland), culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences. The Deputy will be aware my Department&rsquo;s regional NPWS staff have conducted several such culls in recent years.</p>  <p>  On foot of a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in the National Park and a further census of areas of the Park conducted in Spring 2017, my Department commenced a cull of deer there last month. It is hoped to conclude the cull by the end of March. This work will be undertaken by qualified and competent National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel of my Department. The proposed cull is at a similar level to that which was undertaken in previous years.</p></reply>
