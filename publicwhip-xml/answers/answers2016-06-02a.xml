Work is assigned by the Secretary General in my Department to areas where the skills and expertise reside in order to have the work completed as effectively and efficiently as possible.  Responsibility for abortion policy is under the remit of the Chief Medical Officer who has overall responsibility for the area. </p>  <p>  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 was enacted on 30th July 2013 and commenced on 1st January 2014.  The development of the Act reflected the very considerable input of a number of staff in the Chief Medical Officer's division.  This means that very considerable knowledge and expertise on abortion and related matters resides within this area of the Department.  The senior officers involved also have other responsibilities and this extends to the regulation of tobacco and alcohol.</p>  <p>   The Act regulates access to lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with the X case and the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C v Ireland case.  Its purpose is to confer procedural rights on a woman who believes she may have a life-threatening condition, so that she can have certainty as to whether she requires a termination.</p>  <p>  As evidenced by the significant programme of work undertaken, my Department continues to actively engage with policy issues in this area, under the direction of the Government and the Oireachtas.  The Government has made a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to establish a Citizen's Assembly to make recommendations to the D&aacute;il on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-02a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060200041#WRA00700"><p>The HSE aims for the placement of children in age appropriate mental health settings as much as possible.  A  95% target of appropriate placement in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Units is indicated in the National Service Plan 2016.  This allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units.  Examples of factors that influence such admissions include the availability of a bed in, or the distance to, the nearest Child and Adolescent Mental Health Unit, the wishes of the young person involved, or the need for an urgent clinical assessment.  While it remains challenging for the HSE to meet this ambitious target, significant progress has been made; there were 95 admissions to adult units in 2015 compared to 247 such admissions in 2008.  It is a priority for the HSE to keep such admissions to a minimum, and this is kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  The  admission of a child or adolescent to an Acute Adult Inpatient Unit is only made following a clinical assessment of the needs of the individual at community level, and in consultation with the HSE Mental Health Directorate.  The Mental Health Commission is also informed of any admission of a child into an adult unit.</p>  <p>  There are currently 66 operational  Child and Adolescent Mental Health beds across the country.  This includes extra 8 beds recently opened in the new Linn Dara Unit in Dublin, and further beds for those under 18 are scheduled to open in the system.  In the context of expanding child bed capacity, the HSE is endeavouring  at present to address staff recruitment or retention difficulties in certain facilities, such as the Eist Linn unit in Cork.  As these staffing issues are resolved, the potential  exists for an overall national capacity of 76  operational Child and Adolescent Mental Health beds in the system.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the HSE is making progress in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy, while taking account of the wishes of each young person, their parents or guardians, and the complexities of each case.  This includes factors such as geographic location, the expected length of stay, which is usually very short-term, and the age of the young persons involved, which is usually in the 16-18 year age bracket.  The HSE also makes special arrangements, where such placements occur, to ensure specific supports and protections for those involved under age 18. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to closely monitor this issue, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure that the various new initiatives contribute to improving CAMHS services across all regions.  While it is not possible to attach specific timeframes to eliminating this practice completely every effort will be made to achieve further progress on this issue.</p></reply>

One of the objectives of the HSE Mental Health Division has been to improve the response of mental health services for individuals in such circumstances.  This includes accommodation and treatment for an individual in the most appropriate setting, relevant to their presenting need.</p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government commits to further enhancing 24/7 service support and liaison teams in primary and emergency care, building on the commitment in the HSE National Service Plan 2016 for this area, including the development and staffing of crisis houses and the crisis response generally, and enhanced 24/7 access to specialist services where a psychiatric assessment considers this necessary. </p>  <p>  Counselling is provided across the health service by both the HSE and the voluntary sector, including in primary care, but also within social care and mental health services.  Counselling can be provided by a range of trained health professionals operating in primary care or more specialist services to meet clinical needs. </p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care service is a national service expanded in recent years to increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and to supplement existing services provided at primary care level.  Since 2012, &euro;7.5 million has been provided to develop this service.  The service provides short term counselling for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 years and over who hold a valid medical card.</p>  <p>  Counselling and psychotherapy are provided within specialist community mental health teams when service users are clinically assessed as requiring this intervention.  Counselling is also provided by a range of voluntary organisations across the health service.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention also  funds voluntary organisations such as Pieta House and Console to provide support across a range of needs. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2016 identifies priorities for allocation of new development funding this year including the continued development of early intervention and counselling services.  This includes funding for the development of counselling services in primary care for young people, in collaboration with the mental health services, and funding for the provision of new Jigsaw mental health services for young people in Cork, Dublin City centre and Limerick.  The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these specific initiatives for  enhanced services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on the release of the development funding for 2016 will be made shortly.</p></reply>

In that context, a phased investment in a multi annual programme involving manpower, vehicles and technology is required.  Additional funding of &euro;7.2m has been provided for the National Ambulance Service in 2016 which includes &euro;2m for new developments.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Programme for Government commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that many of the key recommendations of both reviews are already being addressed as part of a significant programme of reform and modernisation of the National Ambulance Service which has been underway in recent years.  This programme has now achieved many of its key targets including the establishment of the National Emergency Operations Centre, and the creation of an integrated deployment platform which allows the ambulance service to operate as a national fleet, rather than in regional divisions; continued delivery of improved technology to improve response times; and expansion of the Community First Responder scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the National Ambulance Service in relation to service requirements and performance and will continue to do so to ensure that the action plan is implemented.</p></reply>

Catherine Byrne TD has been appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for Communities and the National Drugs Strategy which expires at end 2016 and in respect of which a new and important strategy for the future is being developed.  Helen McEntee TD has been appointed as Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, with responsibility for all legislation, policy and funding relating to the provision of mental health services for adults as well as children and adolescents, including the new strategy on suicide prevention.  Minister McEntee will also be responsible for all services for older people, including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  Marcella Corcoran Kennedy TD has been appointed as Minister of State for Health Promotion with responsibility for driving the health and well-being agenda which was already given a priority status under the last Government and requires to be pro-actively rolled out across the entire population for the benefit of the nation's health. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government places particular emphasis on enhancement of the capacity of primary care and improving the integration between primary care and other services, in particular the acute hospital system.  In my view the achievement of a decisive shift of focus to primary care, with the maximum proportion of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs being met in the community, is best ensured by political responsibility for this agenda resting with me as Minister for Health.</p></reply>

It has advised that details relating to training positions are contained in its most recent report <i>'Annual Assessment of NCHD Posts'. </i>This report outlines all of the training positions by specialties and can be found within the Staff and Career section of its website.Detailed information regarding trainees by hospital site is maintained by the individual training bodies. </p><p>The HSE has confirmed that for the training year 2015 to 2016 only 29 posts at First Year Basic Specialist Training  level remained unfilled by trainees and the majority of these posts were in General Internal Medicine.  However, these posts have been filled by doctors who are not on training programmes and are not vacant.</p><p>Only permanent appointed consultants who are registered on the Specialist Register of the Irish Medical Council are eligible to be trainers.  Of 58 whole time equivalent consultants employed in Letterkenny General Hospital, 40 are permanently appointed and are, therefore, eligible to oversee training of NCHDs.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the low take up of training positions outside of Dublin is a priority and is being addressed.  Geographical distribution of trainees is a standing item on the bi-annual meeting between each training body and the HSE and forms part of the annual service level agreement between each training body and the HSE.  All training programmes now include mandatory rotations outside of the Dublin area, and almost all have mandatory rotations to model three hospitals. </p><p>There is a global shortage of doctors and intense competition amongst those in training to access the best training opportunities available.  However, I am satisfied that the HSE recognises the need to support the distribution of training posts across the system as far as practicable and has introduced measures to ensure that the training model supports hospitals outside of Dublin to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

It advocated:</p><p>-  A holistic view of mental illness and an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.</p><p>-  A move away from traditional institutional-based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service.</p><p>-  A person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.</p><p>-  The aiming of interventions at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on the resources within service users and within their immediate social networks, to allow them to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.</p><p>-  The organisation, nationally, of mental health services in catchment areas for populations of between 250,000 and 400,000, with specialist expertise provided by community mental health teams</p><p>&ndash; expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to service the needs of service users across the lifespan. </p><p><i>'A Vision for Change'</i>has guided national mental health policy for the past 10 years and its term comes to an end this year.  The Department is currently finalising a request for tender for a review and analysis of international evidence and best practice in the development of mental health services, including a review of current delivery of services in Ireland.  This review will provide evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of  <i>'A Vision for Change'. </i>The review will also have regard to both human rights and health and well-being objectives.  At that stage, the exact timeframe for completion of the revised policy direction will be determined by the planned analysis outlined above.</p></reply>

We recognise the importance of fully implementing this long-standing policy in a manner which recognises both geographic accessibility and which will allow primary care teams in particular to provide or access a much greater range of care.  However, as A Vision for Changeis 10 years old this year the Government is also committed to conducting an evidence-based expert review of progress in its implementation and in the improvement of mental health services.  The review will take account of international best practice and will inform the next steps in the development of our mental health policy, having regard to both human rights and health and wellbeing objectives. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government gives a clear commitment to increasing the mental health budget annually so that we can build capacity in existing services and develop new services.  For example, we aim to extend counselling services in primary care to people on low income and .extend support for organisations that offer free counselling and psychological services.  In addition, we will work to ensure that every Emergency Department has Clinical Nurse Specialists in psychiatry on their team, with greater linkages to primary care.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises the need to further promote awareness and prevention strategies in our education system.  We acknowledge that a more thorough understanding of students&rsquo; own emotional wellbeing is also required.  That is why a National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health will be established to consider how best to introduce and teach resilience and coping mechanisms to children and young people, and also how to access support services voluntarily at a young age.  Accessible and informal mental health services can play a vital role in connecting with young people.  We plan to extend services such as Jigsaw, which offers free access and a more informal environment to young people who wish to engage with our mental health services.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of the national suicide strategy Connecting for Life - a national plan for the whole of Government and the whole of society to work together.  The importance of this strategy cannot be underestimated, and I plan to ask the relevant Oireachtas Committee to monitor and oversee its implementation. </p>  <p>  Some &euro;115m in additional funding was added to the mental health budget in the HSE National Service Plans over the period 2012 to 2016.  I am confident that, as the economy continues to grow, the priority this Government attaches to mental health will see further development of services through additional funding and effective use of existing resources.</p></reply>

In 2015, the National Service Plan Budget for mental health was &euro;791 million and the outturn was &euro;785 million.  The &euro;826 million budget for mental health in the 2016 National Service Plan therefore represents an increase of &euro;41 million or 5.2% over the 2015 outturn.  The 2016 budget includes &euro;35 million in heldback funding for new developments.</p>  <p>  The &euro;35m allocation for mental health will fund new service developments.  The HSE National Service Plan 2016 identifies priorities for allocation of the &euro;35 million, including the continued development of early intervention and counselling services across both primary and secondary care; the provision of new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin City Centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; services for Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically for ADHD in Adults and Children, and for Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these specific enhanced priority services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on the release of the 2016 development funding will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Staff recruitment is a key element of these developments.  I am informed that, as staff recruitment takes time, the 2016 HSE National Service Plan envisages that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12m from the mental health development funding will be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds, and for vaccine procurement.  The detailed use of all development funding is currently being examined and will be the subject of decisions shortly.</p></reply>

On 4 May 2016, there were 172 patients on the waiting list at Crumlin. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting lists at Crumlin, over &euro;1m was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts and support staff, and 10 additional WTE staff are now in place including a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, consultant anaesthetist, clinical nurse specialist and other nursing staff.  Separately an additional &euro;1m approximately has been allocated in 2016 on a full year basis for orthopaedics and trauma to address waiting lists for orthopaedics in the Children's Hospital Group.  This funding will also assist in improving access for scoliosis patients. </p>  <p>  Capital funding has also been provided by the HSE for a new theatre on site at Crumlin to expand capacity further.  Construction is now complete and the building is currently being commissioned with handover expected in the coming weeks.  The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  External capacity has also been identified in order to address waiting times while internal capacity is being built up, and patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals in Ireland and the UK, where capacity is available and where it is clinically appropriate.  The HSE continues to work actively with Crumlin and the Children's Hospital Group to improve access to spinal surgery for children and young people. </p>  <p>  I am advised there are currently 7 patients on the public waiting list for scoliosis procedures at Galway.  Galway University Hospital is working actively to identify additional theatre sessions when available to address current waiting list needs.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concern that difficulties in accessing such a vital service as scoliosis surgery are resolved.  There is a very active programme of measures underway to address the underlying issues speedily and comprehensively.</p></reply>

A key objective is the provision of a safer, less stigmatising alternative to hospital care that provides refuge and support in a more communal, family-like environment.  The HSE Operational Plan for Mental Health 2016 highlights the need to expand services for those who are homeless, and who also have mental health issues, through an improved multi-agency approach.</p>  <p>  The current development of Crisis Houses, and Crisis Intervention Teams, form part of a spectrum of service supports for individuals with a mental illness presenting in crisis.  One of the objectives of the HSE Mental Health Division has been to improve the response of mental health services for individuals in such circumstances.  This includes accommodation and treatment for an individual in the most appropriate setting, relevant to their presenting need.</p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government commits to further enhancing 24/7 service support and liaison teams in primary and emergency care, building on the commitment in the HSE National Service Plan 2016 for this area, including the development and staffing of crisis houses, and enhanced 24/7 access to specialist services where a psychiatric assessment considers this necessary.</p></reply>

Despite this, the health sector is facing challenges in managing expenditure within budget in some areas.  The HSE's financial information for March, the latest available, shows net expenditure of &euro;3,284 million against a &euro;3,164 million profile, resulting in an overspend of &euro;120 million for the three months.  The acute hospital sector deficit of &euro;81 million represents 68% of the overall deficit.  Other significant deficits arise in respect of the State Claims Agency of &euro;17 million and Social Care of &euro;21 million.</p>  <p>  The HSE has established seven cost management groups to develop short and medium term actions to address specific areas of financial challenge across the acute hospital sector.  These groups are expected to report their findings in the coming weeks.  Patient safety and maintenance of service levels are key objectives to be satisfied when establishing savings measures.</p>  <p>  The nature of the State Claims Agency scheme means that determining trends and projections from three months' data is not conclusive.  Pressures in the social care area arise from costs associated with compliance with disability standards and meeting demands for home care packages and home help.</p>  <p>  With only three months of data, the ability to determine expenditure trends and derive a projected outturn is limited.  The Department of Health will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that every effort is made to maximise cost containment and cost avoidance measures to mitigate any overruns to the greatest degree possible.</p></reply>

ED attendances have been significantly higher this year, particularly in Quarter 1.  To date, the HSE has reported an average increase in attendances of nearly 6% compared with the same period last year.  Despite attendance increases, TrolleyGar numbers in Quarter 1 2016 are similar to those for 2015.  Furthermore, figures for May 2016 show total numbers of patients on trolleys are approximately 18% lower in May 2015, with numbers waiting over 9 hours approximately 24% lower.</p>  <p>  The HSE maintains records on service users who register at an ED and choose to leave without actively discharging themselves.  Figures for March 2016 indicate that 3.9% of ED patients &lsquo;did not wait&rsquo; to complete their episode of care, which is within the internationally accepted safe target of less than 5%.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that patient experience times have improved in April 2016, with 67.6% of patients being admitted or discharged within 6 hours and 81.7% within 9 hours.  Reducing the wait times for patients attending EDs is a priority for this Government.  Investments in capital expansion are ongoing (new EDs have been completed in the Mater and Wexford Hospitals and are planned in Beaumont and Galway).  366 extra beds have been opened or re-opened.  A review of bed capacity in our health service, coupled with a review of Medical Assessment Unit hours are further key commitments intended to alleviate ED overcrowding.</p></reply>

The NTPF supports the management of in-patient, day-case and outpatient waiting lists, by working with the HSE to assist hospitals in developing local demand and capacity planning and providing technical guidance materials to ensure the highest standard of data quality and practice.</p>  <p>  The expertise amassed by the NTPF in respect of waiting lists has proven invaluable in assisting the HSE to administer previous waiting list initiatives and in carrying out smaller-scale targeted initiatives in areas such as endoscopy.  In respect of the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to provide &euro;15m to the NTPF in 2017 to address waiting lists, this commitment seeks to utilise the expertise of that agency to further assist the HSE in addressing specific waiting list pressures. </p>  <p>  The future role of the NTPF will be considered in the context of the wider Health Reform Programme.  No decision has been taken as to whether this will include direct procurement of patient treatment by the NTPF and therefore a requirement for a cost benefit analysis of the reactivation of the NTPF has not arisen.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage with the NTPF and the HSE regarding the development of the Programme for a Partnership Government initiative.  As has been the case with previous initiatives, Hospital Groups will be requested to identify insourced capacity in the first instance, with activity outsourced only where insufficient capacity and/or consultant availability exists to ensure patient treatment in a timely fashion.</p></reply>

Funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785m, to a projected budget of &euro;826m in the 2016 NSP, an increase of &euro;41m or 5.2%, which includes &euro;35m ring-fenced for mental health in 2016.</p>  <p>  The &euro;35m allocation for mental health will fund new service developments.  The HSE National Service Plan 2016 identifies priorities for allocation of the &euro;35 million, including the continued development of early intervention and counselling services across both primary and secondary care; the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin City Centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; services for Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically for ADHD in Adults and Children, and for Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these specific enhanced priority services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on the release of the 2016 development funding will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Staff recruitment is a key element of these developments.  As staff recruitment takes time, however, the 2016 HSE National Service Plan envisages that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12m from the mental health development funding will be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds, and for vaccine procurement.  As the initiatives planned for mental health identified in the Service Plan are approved, arrangements will be made for the release of funding, having regard to the overall Service Plan requirement.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  With regard to assisted living services, the Health Service Executive's priority in the 2016 National Service Plan is to protect the level of services provided in 2015 and to provide 1.3 million hours of Personal Assistant services to 2,000 people with a physical/sensory disability and 2.6 million hours of Home Support to 7,300 people with a range of disabilities.  The provision of Personal Assistant services has an annual cost of &euro;30 million, with an annual cost of &euro;52 million for Home Support services.</p>  <p>  Personal Assistant hours are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the service is at all times responsive to clients needs and that the hours available are allocated appropriately and in a timely manner.  In 2015, the HSE exceeded the expected activity level for Personal Assistant hours by approximately 100,000 hours.  This reflects the responsive nature of the service provided and takes account of the fluctuation of assessed need over time.  The need for increased Personal Assistant services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to explore various ways of responding effectively to this need from available resources.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;8 million for initiatives in therapy services for young people.  The two initiatives are the continued implementation of the Progressing Disabilities Services Programme, including development of early intervention services to facilitate the integration of children with disabilities in mainstream preschool settings (&euro;4 million), and a primary care speech and language waiting-list initiative (&euro;4million).  The release of held-back funding is subject to the HSE submitting a plan to the Department for approval, prior to the funding then being released.</p>  <p>  A proposal was provided by the HSE in relation to continued implementation of the Progressing Disabilities Services Programme.  The proposal was examined and approval was subsequently given to release the &euro;4m in funding, which equates to approximately 75 additional therapy posts.  Approval was also based on the understanding that 50 of these 75 posts are to be used to focus on developing early intervention services, including the implementation of the important new model on supporting access to Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, which is being lead by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  In terms of Primary Care services nationally, the HSE has developed proposals to improve access to primary care speech and language therapy services and to address the waiting lists for assessment and therapy treatment.  The details are currently being finalised by the HSE and my Department.  The proposed initiative will include the appointment of new posts to address the current waiting lists for speech and language therapy services for 0 - 18 year olds.  The additional capacity will address pending initial assessments and therapies.  The HSE National Service Review Group is also examining primary care speech and language services so that decisions can be taken in relation to the longer term resource allocations which may require a redistribution of resource.

Every year there are 3.2m outpatient attendances at our hospitals. 100,000 patients have elective inpatient procedures and 800,000 have planned day case procedures.</p>  <p>  In 2015 my predecessor introduced a maximum waiting time of 15 months to be attained by the end of December 2015, focussing on patients waiting longest.  Under the 2015 Waiting List Initiative, almost 36,000 additional outpatient appointments were provided, to achieve 93% compliance with the 15 month maximum waiting time.</p>  <p>  Whilst acknowledging that the numbers waiting over 12 months increased between December 2015 and April 2016, it is important to note that  greater demand for emergency care arises in the peak winter period.  This, in turn, impacts the number of outpatient appointments available.  Despite this challenge, 94% of patients currently wait less than 15 months, with over 60% of patients waiting less than 6 months for their required care.  We also continue to see reductions in outpatient waiting times year on year.</p>  <p>  The HSE has established a Scheduled Care Governance Group to coordinate initiatives to reduce waiting list numbers, focussing on chronological scheduling and administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently engaging with the NTPF and the HSE in planning a dedicated 2016 waiting list initiative.

The provision of harm reduction measures, such as needle and syringe programmes and methadone maintenance treatment, reduce drug-related harm and facilitate recovery by providing a pathway into services.</p>  <p>  However, there is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere.  This practice is unhygienic and poses a significant health risk for the drug users themselves and results in discarded needles which present a public health risk to others.</p>  <p>  The establishment of supervised injecting facilities has been proposed to ameliorate this problem.  The Government has committed to supporting a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drugs use including legislating for supervised injection facilities.</p>  <p>  A supervised injecting facility works to prevent injury and death, and connect people with help, by the provision of a supervised space where drug users may self-administer drugs by injection in safer conditions, and where immediate care can be given in the event of overdose.  Unlike other forms of Drug Consumption Rooms, it does not make provision for consumption by other routes of administration, such as smoking.</p>  <p>  On the 15 of December 2015, the Government decided to include additional Heads in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to provide enabling provisions for supervised injecting facilities.  These provisions would enable the Minister for Health to issue licences permitting the establishment of supervised injecting facilities to provide enhanced clinical support to, and mitigate the problem of public injecting by, chronic drug users.</p>  <p>  Drafting of the Bill by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is at an advanced stage and, subject to approval by Government, it is anticipated that it will be published in coming months. The Bill and the subsequent Ministerial regulations made thereunder, will allow for the licensing, provision and operation of supervised injecting facilities under specific circumstances, whilst protecting the public health and ensuring that the prohibition on possession and supply of illicit drugs outside of such facilities is adequately maintained.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that initially one supervised injecting facility would be established on a pilot basis in Dublin city centre.  An independent evaluation would be an intrinsic element to this initiative; determining the utility, safety and cost-effectiveness of the supervised injecting facility in an Irish context.  The outcome of such an evaluation will inform any decision to licence further facilities.  In line with the experience of other countries which have established such facilities, it would be expected that the numbers would be few and the locations carefully selected to address most effectively the requirements and concerns of the service users and the wider community.</p></reply>

This reply encompasses both this question and your previous question of 21 April 2016.</p>  <p>  As of 31 May, 2016, a total of 803 nurses and midwives have been registered by the NMBI since 1 January 2016.  In addition, 681 applicants have been issued with decision letters setting out what they must do to progress to the final stage of registration.</p>  <p>  The NMBI fully recognises the challenges being experienced by health service employers in the public and the private sector and the NMBI is meeting and liaising with employers to address the registration issues.  The NMBI is also liaising with a large number of recruitment agencies on a daily and weekly basis to support the recruitment and registration process.  Senior NMBI staff are also endeavouring to explore the best ways of improving the efficiency of the existing process, whilst still maintaining the standards of education and professional competence required to enable registration.  A new streamlined application form and information booklet was also launched earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Various measures including enhanced website functionality, additional staff appointments and ongoing process improvement work by NMBI staff is assisting in making headway in the management of the increasing volumes of applications received by the NMBI to facilitate new nurses and midwives entering the Irish health system as quickly as possible without compromising standards.</p>  <p>  While NMBI has registered 803 nurses and midwives in 2016 to date and issued 681 applicants with  decision letters, there are a further 1,947 applications unable to progress to assessment stage due to incomplete documentation being submitted by applicants who have all been contacted in this regard.  It should be noted that as well as a completed application form, overseas applicants must send in identity documents and arrange for other supporting documents to be sent directly to NMBI.  These include a transcript of their education programme, a certificate confirming registration and good standing as a nurse, as well as a reference from their current or most recent employer.  Only when these documents have been received can the application for registration be assessed.  It is incumbent on recruitment agencies and employers to emphasise to applicants that it is their responsibility to ensure all relevant documents are sent to NMBI.  Since March 1, applicants have six months from the date of application to submit all of their documentation, otherwise their application will be closed.  Previously, applicants had twelve months to submit their documentation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the decision following this assessment may not always be registration.  The outcome can be to seek further information/clarification from the applicant, to register, to refuse registration, or to advise the applicant they must successfully complete a period of adaptation and assessment as a pre-requisite to registration.  In late 2015, the NMBI approved, on a pilot basis, an aptitude test developed by the RCSI as an alternative option to undergoing a period of adaptation and assessment and this is proving a successful and popular alternative.  NMBI has now approved the initiative for a further two years, which will facilitate 40 applicants to take the test monthly.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the NMBI is working with Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) to explore ways of encouraging the large amount of nurses on the inactive part of the Register in Ireland to recommence practising.  The provision of Return to Nursing Practice programmes by the HSE is also supporting this initiative.</p></reply>

The purpose of ABF is to change the model of funding from the previously existing block grant budget system to a new approach where hospitals are paid based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients within a fixed budget system.  This model is designed to increase transparency, promote efficiency, and ensure a fairer system of resource allocation.  Currently ABF is being applied to Inpatient and Day Case activity in 38 hospitals which account for the majority of hospital expenditure.  Given the scale of the change being undertaken the full roll out of ABF will take place over a number of years.</p><p>The HSE published the &ldquo;<i>Activity Based Funding Programme Implementation Plan 2015-2017</i>&rdquo; in May 2015.  In order to ensure financial stability during the process of moving to ABF, this Implementation Plan includes a provision for transition payments to be made.  These are adjustments/payments that will be made to hospitals which are currently operating above the national average price for activity.  They can occur for many reasons, which fall into two categories - issues within the control of the hospital (e.g. low Day of Surgery Admission rates or higher than average patient Length of Stay), or those that are not (e.g. structural issues such as geographic location).</p><p>A major Benchmarking exercise encompassing all ABF hospitals was carried out during 2015, two of the main purposes of which were to calculate the level of transition adjustments to apply in 2016 and to begin the process of identifying the reasons for the price disparities.  Hospitals will be required to develop plans to reduce their costs and address the need for transition adjustments related to issues within their control, which will be phased out over a period of time.  Other structural type issues will continue to be funded.</p><p>As this is the conversion year and therefore the first year that ABF is in operation, the time frame under which transition payments will be eliminated has not yet been determined.  However, the transition payments will continue for a number of years to allow hospitals to address any issues with their cost base.  Hospitals will be supported to better understand and therefore address such issues through the implementation of new Patient Level Costing and ABF reporting systems.</p></reply>

Under a Framework Agreement, signed in 2014, the HSE, the Department of Health, and Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the General Medical Services (GMS) and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.  A priority of these discussions will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients.  </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;13.5 million from the 2016 HSE Primary Care budget was held within the Department of Health for GP contract developments, which includes rural practices, access to diagnostics and minor surgery, and extending GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 years and 11 years.  It is expected that the full &euro;13.5 million in hold-back funding will be fully utilised during 2016 in accordance with the HSE 2016 National Service Plan. </p>  <p>  The HSE has recently developed a pilot service whereby a GP can refer adult medical card and GP visit card holders for ultrasound scans.  Patients deemed to be urgent are seen within 5 working days and routine patients are seen within 10 working days.  The service is currently available in 10 primary care centres and the plan is to improve GP access to ultrasound in other areas of the country throughout 2016 - 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE in collaboration with the Irish College of General Practitioners is completing a pilot research project involving 23 GPs in 20 practices who are delivering a range of minor surgery procedures in general practice.  Subject to analysis of the results, the pilot will be extended to a further 40 GP practices.  This will allow in the region of 10,000 procedures on hospital waiting lists to be fast-tracked in General Practice.</p>  <p>  The HSE's 2016 Operational Plan sets out a number of the 2016 planned initiatives on chronic disease management in primary care, including:</p>  <p>  - improve integrated pathways across all Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) in collaboration with the Integrated Programme for Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease for patients with COPD, Asthma, Ischaemic Heart Disease and Diabetes;</p>  <p>  - provide structured education programmes for patients with Diabetes;</p>  <p>  - implement the Integrated Model of Care for Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease in identified areas and implementing the Chronic Disease Demonstrator Projects; and</p>  <p>  - develop and recruit new clinical roles and structures to support integrated care implementation in CHOs. </p></reply>

North-South cooperation on health matters takes place through the North South Ministerial Council as well as joint departmental projects.  There has been significant activity in cross-border health and social care activity over the last decade.  Collaboration takes place on a wide range of health and social care issues including, for example, health promotion (tobacco and obesity), cancer research, food safety, suicide prevention and GP out of hours services.  Future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.  Further cooperation on organ transplantation is also currently being explored. </p>  <p>   A new Radiotherapy Unit at Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, is being developed by the Western Health and Social Care Trust (Northern Ireland).  The Radiotherapy Unit, which is due to open in autumn 2016, will provide access to radiotherapy services to people in the northwest of the island, including patients from this jurisdiction.  A Service Level Agreement between the Trust and the Health Service Executive has been agreed for the provision of services to patients from this jurisdiction.  The HSE will pay the trust for the provision of these services.  The Irish Government has committed capital funding of one third of the cost (up to &euro;19m) of the project. </p>  <p>  There is continued engagement between my Department and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on progressing co-operation in the area of Congenital Heart Disease.  Significant progress has been made in respect of establishing an all-island model of care for Congenital Heart Disease (CHD).  The CHD Network Board, which was jointly established in 2015, has submitted a full business case for the implementation of this model of care, and that business case is currently under consideration in both Departments.</p>  <p>  A significant milestone  in the development of a cross border cardiology service  was announced in April and has been operational since last month which sees Donegal patients having access to 24/7 primary Percutaneous Coronary Invention (pPCI Services) at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry.  I am delighted that this service will be available to the wider population of the Northwest.  </p>  <p>  &euro;30 million was allocated under the European Regional Development Fund INTERREG IVA programme to Cooperation and Working Together (CAWT Partnership) for cross-border health and social care initiatives.  CAWT delivered the project on behalf of the two health departments North and South across 12 strands of activity with a strong focus on improving access to services, promoting health and well-being, reducing health inequalities and promoting social inclusion.  The latest European Regional Development Fund programme INTERREG V 2014-2020 has four priority areas, one of which is health.  For the health priority, the funding available for the duration of the Programme is &euro;62m, i.e. &euro;53m EU funding and &euro;9.35m match funding from the two member states.  Projects which will receive funding under this programme will aim, like previous INTERREG programmes, to benefit the health and wellbeing of border communities. </p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to work together with my Northern colleagues on issues of common concern and benefit.</p></reply>

The spread of these resistant strains is further increased, however, through poor hygiene practices and increased global travel and trade.  There are also increasing concerns about the potential for spread of antimicrobial resistance in food and environmental pollution with antimicrobials e.g. through water contamination and agricultural run-off. </p><p>In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee was established in November 2014 to address this issue.  The Committee is co-chaired by the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO). </p><p>The Committee also functions as Ireland&rsquo;s Intersectoral co-ordinating mechanism for addressing AMR at European level. </p><p>The Committee was launched, with Ministerial approval, on European Antibiotic Awareness Day in November 2014 and has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors.  Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of the relevant HSE and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders.  The Committee meets bi-annually and its most recent meeting took place on 13 April 2016. </p><p>Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end.  Through membership of the World Health Organisation, Ireland is part of the international effort aimed at tackling the global public health threat of AMR, which requires action across human and animal health sectors, agriculture and the wider environment.</p><p>In May 2015 at the WHO 68th World Health Assembly the final WHO Global Action Plan was endorsed; it sets out five strategic objectives:</p><p>1. to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;</p><p>2. to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research;</p><p>3. to reduce the incidence of infection;</p><p>4. to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents; and</p><p>5. develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.</p><p>Through adoption of the Global Action Plan, governments committed to have in place, by May 2017, a national action plan on antimicrobial resistance that is aligned with the global action plan.  This national plan will cover the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as for human health.  The WHO is working with countries to support the development and implementation of their national plans, and will report progress to the Health Assembly in 2017. </p><p>The National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee, at its meeting on 13 April last, agreed as a key action for 2016 the development of Ireland&rsquo;s AMR national action plan. </p><p>I would also note that the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR has in any case been a significant, long-standing patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health for many years. </p><p>A wide range of initiatives have been put in place in the Irish health system over several years in response to the rising incidence of AMRs.  These include:</p><p>- improved surveillance of infections and prescribing;</p><p>- infection prevention and control processes;</p><p>- antimicrobial stewardship initiatives; and</p><p>- public and professional awareness raising, with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.</p></reply>

Under this new approach public sector organisations can obtain delegated sanction to recruit within the parameters of their pay budget once they obtain approval for their Pay and Numbers Strategy from their parent Department and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>  This change allows for greater autonomy to be delegated to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels within allocated pay frameworks.  It also provides for further recruitment flexibility, for example where it is determined that offering permanent contracts can achieve more economical service delivery than agency usage. </p>  <p>  Recent measures taken in relation to service areas in the HSE remaining within budget have been portrayed, incorrectly, as a recruitment freeze.  The HSE is currently working with the Department of Health on the finalisation of its 2016 Pay and Numbers Strategy.  This has involved the development of detailed workforce plans at hospital and community service level.   </p>  <p>  These measures do not impact on a hospital&rsquo;s ability to recruit where funding exists to facilitate that recruitment; for example in the case of funded replacement posts or where additional funding has been allocated for new positions under the HSE service plan.  Recruitment can also take place in areas of critical care and emergency services.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has continuously increased staffing levels since the beginning of 2015.  By the end of April this year, overall health service employee numbers had increased by over 6,000 whole time equivalents since the start of last year, with an extra 1,600 WTEs in the first four months of 2016 alone.  The vast majority of these employees are in front line positions.  Numbers in the Medical and Dental category increased by almost 600 WTEs or 6.5% since the start of 2015 while nursing figures rose by over 1,700 or 5% during the same timeframe.</p>  <p>  It is this government&rsquo;s intention to continue to grow the health budget as the economy improves and to obtain further resources to deliver the level of service that we all want to provide to our patients.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles:  equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The National Policy &amp;amp; Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland Report made a number of recommendations for services for people with rehabilitation needs which covered clinical, therapeutic, social, vocational and community supports.  Following the development of the Neuro-rehabilitation Policy &amp;amp; Strategy, the Health Service Executive established the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme, to ensure the optimal care pathway for different clinical needs.  The scope of the  Rehabilitation Medicine Programme covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through primary, secondary and tertiary care.  These Programmes provide a national, strategic and coordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  They include the standardization of access to and delivery of, high quality, safe and efficient hospital services nationally, as well as better linkages with primary care services.  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has almost completed the Model of Care for the provision of specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland, which will be the basis for the delivery of services.</p>  <p>  At the same time, the HSE Disability Services Division has a role in the provision of Neuro-rehabilitation services, primarily the provision of community based therapy services and personal social services.  As part of the Transforming Lives programme, the programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money &amp;amp; Policy Review of Disability Services, the HSE is focusing on disability funded rehabilitation services to encourage reconfiguration of existing provision through the establishment of demonstration sites.  Close links are being maintained with the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that all initiatives receive optimal support.</p>  <p>  Alongside these developments, the Government announced a major development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital with a commitment of around &euro;40 million.  The new development will deliver a 120 bed ward capacity, including support therapies, paediatric and acquired brain injury wards, a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall. </p>  <p>  With regard to Neuro-rehabilitation services, the Programme for Partnership Government places a particular focus on publishing a plan for advancing Neuro-rehabilitation services in the community.  Currently a steering group led by the Health Service Executive Social Care Division with representation from the National Clinical Programmes for Rehabilitation Medicine and Neurology, Department of Health, Primary Care, Therapy Professions and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, has drafted an implementation framework for the National Policy &amp;amp; Strategy for Neuro-rehabilitation services, which has been circulated to members of the steering group and stakeholder agencies for consultation.  Following feedback, the implementation framework will be revised and will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of Neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level. </p></reply>

Members of the Traveller community are identified as a priority group.

The Strategy aims to provide a set of specific actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma.  A number of cross-cutting themes have emerged in the consultation process for the Strategy such as accommodation, employment, health and education.  It is intended that the Strategy will include agreed actions in relation to improving the health of travellers.

Shortly afterwards, the second phase implemented universal GP care without fees for all people aged 70 years and over.  This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees, without having to undergo a means test.  The under-6s GP service contract also included age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and also introduced a cycle of care for children with asthma.  In October 2015, a specific Diabetes Cycle of Care provided by GPs for adult patients with Type 2 diabetes who hold a medical card or GP visit card was launched. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was agreed between the IMO, the HSE and the Department of Health.  The enhanced package included improved qualifying criteria for rural support and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216 to &euro;20,000 per annum.  In order to support additional services being provided by GPs, the IMO, the HSE and the Department of Health also agreed to revisions to the list of special items of GP service.  The revised special items include increased rates of payment for suturing and bladder catheterisation, reflecting the costs and time associated with these services, and the introduction of a 24-hour blood pressure monitoring service by GPs.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, the Government made financial provision for the extension of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 to 11 years.  It is expected that this third phase will bring the total number of those eligible for universal GP care, without having to be assessed by a means test, to approximately 1.2 million people.  This will also be subject to on-going negotiation with the IMO in relation to the scope of the service to be provided and the fee arrangements to apply.  The Programme for Partnership Government also commits to extending in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, the introduction of universal GP care to all children under 18 years of age.  The roll-out of free GP care to under-18s and other cohorts of the population will be considered in the context of the funding available and the capacity of GPs to undertake this additional work. </p>  <p>  Discussions on other aspects of a new GP contract are ongoing.  These will address the changing role of the GP in delivering chronic care within the community, the further development of universal GP care, and how general practice can play its part in addressing the challenges facing the health service.</p></reply>

Services are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Decisions on resource allocations are made and reviewed by front line staff who are familiar with the client&rsquo;s individual needs and circumstances.  All relevant factors are carefully balanced so that as many people as possible can viably stay at home and enjoy the best possible quality of life.  Those who cannot be provided with a service immediately are risk-assessed and placed on a waiting list for resources as they become available.</p><p>Notwithstanding the significant improvements in the overall economic position that we have seen in recent times, pressures continue to apply across the health service.  There is no doubt that home care needs more resources than are currently available, and for this reason the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to increasing funding for Home Care Packages and Home Help.  The planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all of the various service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritise areas of greatest need.  The Minister for Health has already stated that he will seek additional resources for home support services in the next Budget.</p></reply>

To date, the HSE has reported an average increase in attendances of nearly 6% compared with the same period last year.  Despite attendance increases, TrolleyGAR numbers in Quarter 1 2016 are similar to those for 2015.

Figures for March 2016 indicate that 3.9% of ED patients &lsquo;did not wait&rsquo; to complete their episode of care, which is within the internationally accepted safe target of less than 5%.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that patient experience times have improved in April 2016 with 67.6% of patients being admitted or discharged within 6 hours and 81.7% within 9 hours. </p>  <p>  Reducing the wait times for patients attending EDs is a priority for this Government.  Investments in capital expansion are ongoing (new EDs have been completed in the Mater and Wexford Hospitals and are planned in Beaumont and Galway).  366 extra beds have been opened or re-opened.  A review of bed capacity in our health service, coupled with a review of Medical Assessment Unit hours are further key commitments intended to alleviate ED overcrowding.</p></reply>

Workforce Planning models in other countries will be assessed and analysed as part of this development process.  This will provide an overarching framework for strategic, discipline-specific workforce planning and development, including the work of the Taskforce on Staffing and Skill Mix for Nursing and work currently underway in the HSE's National Doctors Training and Planning Unit on medical workforce planning.  The framework is intended to support the stability and sustainability of the health workforce in Ireland into the future.</p>  <p>  The ability to provide high quality health and social care services depends on having a sufficient level of and appropriately trained health and social care workforce in place.</p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants working in the public health service since the establishment of the HSE reflecting the policy outlined in the 'Hanly Report' of moving to a consultant delivered service.  That study recognised that the number of consultants in Ireland were low when compared to international standards.  Numbers have increased by over 850 from the end of 2004 to the end of April 2016 and the HSE is committed to growing the consultant workforce into the future.</p>  <p>  The work of the Taskforce on Staffing and Skill Mix for Nursing will inform policy on the appropriate level of nurse staffing, taking account of factors unique to the Irish health system, in the first instance within the acute hospital sector. </p>  <p>  The HSE's National Doctors Training and Planning Unit is working on a series of medical workforce reports addressing the manpower needs of all medical specialties.  It produced its first report in September 2015 on medical workforce for General Practice in Ireland in which projected the future demand for GPs taking account of a range of factors such as population ageing, Government policies on Primary Care, part-time working and expected retirements and other exits from the workforce.  It is currently working on medical workforce reports for Anaesthesia and Critical Care services.</p></reply>

To date, the HSE has reported an average increase in attendances of nearly 6% compared with the same period last year.  Despite attendance increases, TrolleyGar numbers in Quarter 1 2016 are similar to those for 2015.  Furthermore, figures for May 2016 show total numbers of patients on trolleys are approximately 18% lower than in May 2015, with numbers waiting over 9 hours approximately 24% lower.</p>  <p>  The HSE maintains records on service users who register at an ED and choose to leave without actively discharging themselves.  Figures for March 2016 indicate that 3.9% of ED patients &lsquo;did not wait&rsquo; to complete their episode of care, which is within the internationally accepted safe target of less than 5%. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that patient experience times have improved in April 2016 with 67.6% of patients being admitted or discharged within 6 hours and 81.7% within 9 hours.</p>  <p>  Reducing the wait times for patients attending EDs is a priority for this Government.  Investments in capital expansion are ongoing (new EDs have been completed in the Mater and Wexford Hospitals and are planned in Beaumont and Galway).  366 extra beds have been opened or re-opened.  A review of bed capacity in our health service, coupled with a review of Medical Assessment Unit hours are further key commitments intended to alleviate ED overcrowding.</p></reply>

Funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785m, to a projected budget of &euro;826m in the 2016 NSP, an increase of &euro;41m or 5.2%, which includes &euro;35m ring-fenced for mental health in 2016.</p>  <p>  The &euro;35m allocation for mental health will fund new service developments.  The HSE National Service Plan 2016 identifies priorities for allocation of the &euro;35 million, including the continued development of early intervention and counselling services across both primary and secondary care; the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin City Centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; services for Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically for ADHD in Adults and Children, and for Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these specific enhanced priority services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on the release of the 2016 development funding will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Staff recruitment is a key element of these developments.  As staff recruitment takes time, however, the 2016 HSE National Service Plan envisages that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12m from the mental health development funding will be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds, and for vaccine procurement.  As the initiatives planned for mental health identified in the Service Plan are approved, arrangements will be made for the release of funding, having regard to the overall Service Plan requirement.</p></reply>

This programme has now achieved many of its key targets including the establishment of the National Emergency Operations Centre, and the creation of an integrated deployment platform which allows the ambulance service to operate as a national fleet, rather than in regional divisions; continued delivery of improved technology to improve response times; and expansion of the Community First Responder scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the National Ambulance Service in relation to service requirements and performance and will continue to do so to ensure that the action plan is implemented.</p></reply>

It advises hospitals on how best to manage patient flow when there is a surge in demand for emergency care.  Central to this approach is that hospitals should avoid the need for escalation where possible, by improving systems and planning.</p>  <p>  When necessary, escalated responses are delivered in three stages.  It is only at Stage 3 of escalation, where all hospital admissions occur through the ED, that cancellation of all elective surgeries is considered.  At Stage 3, because of the pressure for emergency care, the hospital must consider redeploying available medical and nursing staff to facilitate patient flow through the hospital.  </p>  <p>  Decisions on admissions are taken by hospitals having regard to safe operating limits of the hospital as a whole.  At Stage 3, it may not be clinically appropriate for post-operative elective patients to be assigned to beds, even if empty, due to infection control or staffing reasons.</p>  <p>  The HSE Special Delivery Unit has conducted reviews at a number of hospitals to date, in order to ensure appropriate implementation of the Escalation Framework. </p>  <p>  A number of initiatives are being implemented to reduce ED overcrowding.  Under the Winter Additional Capacity Initiative a total of 366 new or re-opened beds have been made available.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to progress new ED facilities for Galway and Beaumont Hospitals.</p>  <p>  Further, a review of bed capacity, coupled with the review of the hours of service of Medical Assessment Units are further key commitments  of the Programme intended to alleviate ED overcrowding.</p></reply>

In that context, a phased investment in a multi annual programme involving manpower, vehicles and technology is required.  While the overall funding requirement remains to be quantified, the direct pay cost is estimated to be in the region of &euro;25 million, and the capital cost of the additional fleet is estimated at &euro;10 million.  Additional funding of &euro;7.2 million has been provided for the National Ambulance Service in 2016 which includes &euro;2 million for new developments.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Programme for Government commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that many of the key recommendations of both reviews are already being addressed as part of a significant programme of reform and modernisation of the National Ambulance Service which has been underway in recent years.  This programme has now achieved many of its key targets including the establishment of the National Emergency Operations Centre, and the creation of an integrated deployment platform which allows the ambulance service to operate as a national fleet, rather than in regional divisions; continued delivery of improved technology to improve response times; and expansion of the Community First Responder scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the National Ambulance Service in relation to service requirements and performance and will continue to do so to ensure that the action plan is implemented. </p></reply>

Submissions received as part of that process informed the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which was published in July 2013.  As part of the follow-up to that initiative, in November 2013 the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders who reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard, in particular, to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision.  The Group also examined mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and address practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently progressing a three Phase consultation process with a view to putting a new Disability Inclusion Strategy in place.  Phase 2, which focused on agreeing high-level objectives for the Strategy, was completed at the end of 2015.  Phase 3 will involve agreeing specific actions with timescales to deliver on each of the high-level objectives.  This will commence shortly.  I expect to have a set of draft actions for the Strategy for publication shortly.  The consultations on this draft will include consideration by the National Disability Strategy Steering Group and, as with Phase 2, a series of regional consultation meetings.  The Strategy will then be revised as necessary and submitted to Government for final approval.</p>  <p>  Issues in relation to the Deaf Community have featured strongly in the consultation process to date and I intend that the new Disability Inclusion Strategy will respond credibly to the issues raised, including making a real difference in relation to facilitating the use of Irish Sign Language and ensuring that public bodies provide ISL users with ISL interpretation when availing of their statutory services.  This is where my focus lies as I believe that taking effective steps to ensure that users of Irish Sign Language can use it with interpretation provided when availing of public services is the best approach to meeting the needs of the Deaf community.</p></reply>

Tallaght District forms part of the wider Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Division which has 19 members in its Drugs Unit.  The number of Garda personnel that were assigned to the DMR South Drugs Unit on the 31 December 2010 to 2015 was as set out in the following table.</p><p>It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  The Tallaght District is policed by regular uniformed units, community policing units as well as a District Detective Unit.  It is also supplemented by resources from Divisional units including the Divisional Traffic Unit and the Divisional Burglary Unit. Specifically in relation to drugs, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.  The Garda National Drugs Unit works closely with dedicated Divisional and District Drug Units and other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit, as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that after discussions with my Government colleagues, on Tuesday 31 May, I announced a range of additional measures to tackle organised crime including the strengthening of CAB powers, new legislation to target proceeds of crime and the setting up of a new Special Crime Taskforce that will focus relentlessly on persons involved in gangland activities.  In addition to these measures I will also discuss transnational dimension of organised crime with international counterparts.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the then Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014 and start recruiting once again.  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Some students may wish to attend single semester courses as part of their degree programme with a recognised overseas university.</p><p>It should be noted that nationals from many countries including, for example, Brazil and the USA do not require a visa to come and study in Ireland.  For nationals requiring a visa, in line with other jurisdictions, my Department operates a visa system which examines the bona fides of each study visa application.</p><p>Relevant guideline notes are published on the Student section of the INIS website - .</p><p>The overall immigration regime for students is ultimately a matter of Government policy which reflects the policy choices made and involves the exercise of executive power.

Against this background, the person concerned is now deemed to be a timed-out student.</p>  <p>  Ireland has offered a generous immigration to foreign students, not only in allowing them to work to support themselves in their studies, but also in providing ample opportunity for them to obtain academic qualifications that will equip them for their future, whether that is in Ireland or on their return to their home country.  It is up to each student to make the best use of that opportunity.  If their academic achievement is high, then Ireland offers opportunities to students to stay on as graduates, researchers, or high skilled employees.  In other words, student permission gives the person concerned a chance to qualify for an enhanced immigration status on the basis of their academic achievement.  However, student permission is of a temporary and limited nature that is not reckonable for naturalisation purposes and that generally does not allow for family reunification.  Merely spending time in Ireland as a student does not confer entitlement or expectation to remain.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the document "Guidelines for non-EEA students registered in Ireland before 1 January 2011."

The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farm land is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of 5 years or more.  Farm land is defined for the purposes of the relief and includes land in the State which is wholly or mainly occupied for the purpose of husbandry.  The farm land must be used by the lessee for the purpose of a trade of farming on the land.</p><p>It is considered that land which is leased for the production of renewable energy (such as the installation of solar panels on the land) does not qualify as farm land for the purpose of section 664 relief.  In addition, the installation of renewable energy equipment and the activities associated with the generation of renewable energy would not be regarded as a trade of farming for the purpose of the exemption.  Therefore, in general, leases of land for the production of renewal energy will not be eligible for the relief.  The Revenue Commissioners have published a recent eBrief which specifically clarifies the application of section 664 TCA in respect of leases to solar energy development companies.

The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.

The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of these Codes, under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.  This applies to all regulated entities operating in the State. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. </p><p>I should add that the Central Bank has updated each of the Codes in order to ensure that Credit Servicing Firms are subject to these Codes directly in their own right.  This has been done for the sake of certainty and transparency, in order to make it explicit that the activity of credit servicing is a regulated activity within the meaning of the Codes and firms carrying out that activity are  regulated entities  in their own right with respect to that activity.  As I have previously said, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) were introduced as a prudential policy measure for credit institutions.  Full details of their legal basis were provided in the Central Bank's press release which is available here: . </p><p>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets applied from March 2013 to December 2014.  They had applied to ACC Bank plc, Allied Irish Bank plc (including AIB Mortgage Bank, EBS Limited and EBS Mortgage Finance), The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland (including Bank of Ireland Mortgage Bank and ICS Building Society), KBC Bank Ireland plc, Permanent Tsb plc and Ulster Bank Ireland Limited with respect to their Republic of Ireland principal dwelling home/primary residence (PDH ) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgagees.  In April 2015, the Central Bank determined that relying on common quarterly solution targets across all banks was no longer appropriate and wrote to each bank setting out new requirements. </p><p>I would reiterate that authorised Credit Servicing Firms (including those who have notified the Central Bank that they wish to avail of the transitional arrangements provided for under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015) are required to comply with the requirements of financial services legislation including the Central Banks statutory codes and in particular the CCMA (including as it pertains to matters such as engagement with the borrower).  They are also required to comply with the provisions of other legislation in force in the State as it applies to their activities, including the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Resolution Fund under the 2011 Act is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution. In particular the Resolution fund may be used for: </p><p>- the payment of financial incentives for transfers;</p><p>- providing capital for a bridge bank (details of a bridge bank are set out in Part 4 of the 2011 Act);</p><p>- meeting the expenses of the Central Bank incurred when discharging functions under the Act, and</p><p>- making certain payments under the Act, for example, the payment of expenses to an assessor appointed under the Act. </p><p>To date, the resources of the Resolution Fund have been utilised to fund the resolution of 4 credit unions.  In the case of 3 of those credit unions, the resolution action taken was a directed transfer under the 2011 Act, and the Resolution Fund funded a financial incentive for the transferee.  The remaining case was a liquidation, and no incentive was paid from the Resolution Fund in respect of that resolution.  In each of the 4 cases, the Central Bank discharged its third party resolution-related costs against the Resolution Fund.</p><p>The amounts paid or payable to date from the Resolution Fund for incentives in each of the 3 transfer resolution cases are as follows:</p><p>- Newbridge Credit Union Limited: &euro;27 million</p><p>- Howth Sutton Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million</p><p>- Killorglin Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million</p><p>- Central Bank resolution-related expenses that have been discharged against the Resolution Fund to date amount to &euro;2.7 million.</p><p>To date &euro;35.41 million has been drawn down from the Resolution Fund by way of expenditure relating to incentives for credit union resolution, Central Bank resolution-related expenses and interest expenses. </p><p>The breakdown of expenses per year of operation of the Resolution Fund is as follows: <table><tr><th>October 2011 to December 2012*</th><th>&euro;1.3 million October 2011 to December 2012*</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;26.9 million 2013</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;6.9 Million 2014</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;0.3 million</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (YTD)</td><td>&euro;0.01 million</td></tr></table></p><p>Total income over the period is &euro;34.6m which is made up of levies of &euro;28.7m and other income of &euro;5.9m. </p><p>Under Section 12(2) of the Resolution Act, as Minister for Finance I am entitled to be reimbursed from the Resolution Fund for all contributions to that Fund and for any financial incentive provided. </p><p>*The CIRF was established by the 2011 Act, and was only in operation from October in 2011; therefore the first set of published accounts for the CIRF relate to period from 28 October 2011 to 31 December 2012.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-02a.441.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060200050#WRK03700"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government makes it clear that it is not ethically acceptable for Irish banks to charge excessive interest rates on standard variable rate customers.  The Government has committed to take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates; including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, administered by the Central Bank and the development of a new, easy-to-use standardised and dedicated switching form.  We will also request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  These are Year 1 Actions in the programme. </p>  <p>  Central Bank research on the influences on standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland published last year identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland. </p>  <p>  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.</p>  <p>  I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months since my meetings with the banks.  As recently as last month, two banks made additional reductions to their mortgage offerings.  There has also been media speculation on the entry of another new mortgage provider into the market and the additional competition should help to put further pressure on the existing banks to reduce their rates. </p>  <p>  The Financial Institutions (Bank) Levy was introduced for the three-year period 2014 to 2016 in Finance (No.2) Act 2013, with the purpose of enabling the banking sector to contribute to economic recovery.  The annual yield of the levy is approximately &euro;150 million.  In my Budget 2016 speech last October, I announced the extension of the levy to 2021, with a review to be carried out into the methodology used to calculate the levy.  All taxation measures are considered as part of the annual budgetary process and I will not comment on changes ahead of that consideration.</p></reply>

While neither the Department of Finance nor the Special Liquidators announced the sum that the State is due to receive from this interim dividend, there were various reports stating the sum to be in the region of &euro;275m.  This is based on 25% of a &euro;1.1bn claim which the State has made.</p>  <p>  Given the creditor adjudication process is still ongoing, it is not clear as to what month this interim dividend will be paid.</p>  <p>  The Special Liquidators of IBRC also announced last Friday that their expectation is that the eventual unsecured creditor dividend will be in the range of 75% - 100% of all eligible claims.  While it is too early to confirm whether there will be further interim dividends or when the final dividend will be paid, the Special Liquidators have advised me that this eventual dividend range is subject to change depending on future events which are outside their control.  The ultimate level of dividend paid to each creditor cannot be known until such time as all loan assets are sold, the total level of adjudicated creditors is finalised and the other contingent creditor claims which may crystallise, including those from litigation, are known.</p>  <p>  Any amounts paid into the Exchequer would be recorded as a financial transaction in the General Government accounts under Eurostat rules.  This means that such proceeds would not count as General Government Revenue and, therefore, have no beneficial impact on Ireland's General Government Deficit.  Furthermore, it will not have any effect on the calculation of available fiscal space.  </p>  <p>  However, while not improving the deficit, cash proceeds would result in a reduced Exchequer borrowing requirement which ultimately results in lower debt.  A lower debt level is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability but would also lead to reduced interest payments in future years.  </p></reply>

This includes any mandatory charges or fees in respect of the school's expenses or running costs including costs in respect of the school's own insurance etc. </p><p>  Voluntary contributions by parents are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.  The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</p><p>  A school may seek payment to cover the cost of photocopied material or other such learning materials where the amount sought by the school is consistent with the costs involved and the level of materials provided.  It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p><p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April 2015, contained a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school.  The Bill also provided for exceptions in the case of fees charged by schools known as fee charging schools, fees charged by boarding schools for the boarding element and fees charged by schools for post-leaving certificate courses in so far as those fees relate to the cost of providing such courses. </p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a new School Admissions and Excellence legislation, taking account of current draft proposals.  It would be my intention to maintain those provisions relating to the prohibition on charging fees or seeking payments or contributions in the new School Admissions Bill.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p><p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and parental preferences for each patron is key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.  </p><p>  With regard to the decision on the patronage of the new school which will open this September, to which the Deputy refers, my Department assessed the applications received from the prospective patrons, including examining the parental preferences received in the applications, to ensure they represented children living within the school planning area which will be served by this school, and prepared a report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) who then submitted their report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The valid parental preferences for Educate Together as patron was twice as high as those for a Gaelscoil.  I accepted the recommendation of the NSEG and the patronage of the new school remains as announced.  The NSEG did note the strong level of demand for Irish medium education in the area referred to by the Deputy and recommended that this should be kept under review in the context of future demographic exercises. </p><p>  My Department is focused on ensuring that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area.  My officials are keeping the changing demographics in the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 area under review to take into account updated child benefit data and to take into account the impact of ongoing and planned capacity increases in this and adjacent school planning areas.</p></reply>

Since 2012, the Teaching Council has responsibility for determining policy, procedures and criteria for the induction and probation of newly qualified teachers.  Following approval of the Droichead process as its policy on induction and probation in March 2016, the Council requested the Inspectorate in my Department to continue to conduct inspection visits for the purpose of probation during the growth and development phase.  As part of this growth phase, the Council indicated that from September 2016, newly qualified teachers in mainstream settings may complete probation in the traditional manner, through external evaluation conducted by inspectors.  However, completion of the induction/probation process in special education settings can only be achieved through the Droichead process.</p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p><p>The legislation requires that from 1 July, 2016 the collector will charge for each kilogramme of waste collected.  The Government has set a <i>minimum</i>mandatory fee per kilogramme for the different types of household waste: 11c for black bin (residual waste), 6c for brown bin (food/organic waste) and I have decided that a zero cent <i>minimum</i>fee per kilogramme should be set for green bins (recyclate).  The collector may also charge a service fee, which may typically cover staff, collection, administrative and back office, capital and overhead costs.</p><p>Under the current arrangements, customers pay in a variety of ways including flat fees, pay per lift, pay per tag and banded weighing systems.  As is now the case, from 1 July 2016, it will be a matter for the collector to set charges at the level they consider to be competitive, including whether they wish to charge separately for the collection of recyclate, in compliance with the requirements of the legislation.</p></reply>

In that period, the number of unfinished housing developments has decreased by approximately three-quarters, from nearly 3,000 in 2010 to 668 in 2015.  Of the 668 unfinished developments identified in the 2015 survey, my objective is to resolve as many more developments as possible with a particular focus on the 492 of these developments with residents.</p><p>The detailed findings of the annual surveys providing a breakdown of unfinished housing developments across local authority areas, annual progress reports and other useful publications and information in relation to Unfinished Housing Developments are available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website:</p><p>The 2015 National Housing Development Survey and the Annual Progress Report illustrate that improvements are continuing to be made in resolving unfinished developments and that the reactivation of sites is now evident throughout the country.  The 2015 Survey showed that good progress is being made in Kildare, where 32 unfinished housing developments were recorded in 2015, representing a 56% reduction over 2014.  Reactivation of construction on sites is also evident in the county, with over 30% of the 32 sites in Kildare reactivated in 2015.</p><p>My Department has issued detailed guidance to planning authorities in relation to the taking-in-charge of housing estates and the steps to be followed in this regard.  The matter of taking-in-charge of estates is a matter for Kildare County Council.</p><p>The Government has committed, as set out in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, to seek additional funding for the completion of the remaining unfinished housing developments to 2017.  This recognises that finishing out housing developments will alleviate housing supply pressures and deliver social housing units under the social housing obligations, contained in Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2015.</p></reply>

While fees for professional services are determined by market forces and are therefore outside the scope of my regulatory powers, as part of last year&rsquo;s review of the first twelve months of the operation of the regulations, my Department prepared a <i>Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan for a Single Unit Dwelling on a Single Development</i>.</p><p>The cost calculations published to accompany the Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan demonstrated that the Assigned Certifier role could be achieved at an approximate cost of &euro;3,800 inclusive of VAT.  Where additional design work is required the combined cost of Assigned Certifier duties and additional design work will be of the order of &euro;6,000 inclusive of VAT.  These costs relate to the implementation of the inspection plan on a single non-complex dwelling; they do not relate to multi-units dwellings, such as apartments, where the costs may be considerably lower due to economies of scale.  A copy of this plan and all other documents released as part of that public consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>During the public consultation, a number of respondents confirmed t hat the Assigned Certifier services could be secured in line with the Department&rsquo;s estimates.</p><p>In general terms, the cost of delivering housing is dependent on the type, size and geographic location of the development concerned and on the contractual arrangements leading to its construction.</p><p>Fees for professional services, including those relating to acoustic and energy performance requirements in accordance with Parts E and L of the Building Regulations, are determined by the market place and are separate to requirements under S.I. No. 9 of 2016 as are contractor and specification costs and Part V obligations.</p><p>In the latter case, new obligations under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts have been introduced to balance viability and social housing delivery.  In addition, revised planning guidelines on apartment standards, which are now on a statutory footing under the Planning and Development Acts, have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of high quality apartment building.</p><p>In accordance with the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, my Department is preparing a new <i>Action Plan for Housing</i>and will continue to liaise closely with other Departments and agencies as well as with industry stakeholders with a view to identifying any reasonable and appropriate measures that may be taken in the interests of reducing construction overheads to facilitate an increased level of housing output.</p></reply>

This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) previously available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  There are no plans to introduce changes to this legislation which was introduced on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF.</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, and with reference to a number of factors including the increasing age at which a State pension can be drawn, the previous Government established an Interdepartmental Working Group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider policy that will support fuller working lives.  This Group, on which my Department is represented, is examining the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages for workers in both the private and public sectors.  I understand the Group is due to report to Government in the near future.</p></reply>

One of these actions is a proposal for the Departments of Health and Social Protection to work together to pursue a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; to support more people with an illness or disability to get back to work through early intervention.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Fit for Work&rdquo; proposal is based on the findings of a pan European study, which examined the impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) on an individual&rsquo;s ability to work.  The Irish module of this study was progressed by a coalition of key stakeholders and was led by Arthritis Ireland.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICTU, IBEC and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority also contributed to the study.</p>  <p>  Early interventions and developing return to work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s approach to illness/disability income support, which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.  To this end, my Department has in 2015, issued a set of certification guidelines for GPs, which sets out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions, including MSDs. </p>  <p>  While specific proposals for a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; require further development and scoping out, I would like to assure the Deputy that any such proposals will be in line with the wealth of evidence which shows that generally employment is good for one&rsquo;s mental and physical health and well-being and, conversely, that unemployment is damaging.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy</p></reply>

The budget for 2016 provides &euro;9.6 million to run the service.</p>  <p>  EmployAbility participants are people with a disability, which can range from physical to mental ill health, who are &ldquo;job ready&rdquo; (typically able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week and motivated to work) and need the support of a job coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  All potential EmployAbility clients must be referred through a Department of Social Protection Intreo office, or a Local Employment Service.</p>  <p>  Participants should be in receipt of a disability-related social welfare payment, such as disability allowance, illness benefit, or invalidity pension.  Where a potential client is not on a disability-related payment but on another payment, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s payments, a medical certificate or letter from their GP to verify their illness/injury/disability is required for registration on the service.  There are no plans to change the eligibility criteria in this regard to access this service.</p>  <p>  JobPath is a new approach to employment activation that supports people who are long-term unemployed and who are most distant from the labour market to secure and sustain full-time paid employment.  Only clients in receipt of a jobseeker payment are referred to JobPath.  Where it transpires that a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipient on JobPath requires additional supports that are not available on JobPath and where such supports are available under the EmployAbility service, then arrangements may be made for the person to avail of the EmployAbility service if they meet the eligibility criteria for that service.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The overall allocation to the Mid-West Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Force for community-based drugs initiatives from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive in 2016 is &euro;1,407,989.  This is the same overall level of funding allocated in 2014 and 2015, and a reduction of 9% on the 2009 allocation. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has commissioned external consultants to develop a performance measurement framework to assist in measuring the effectiveness of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces.  The framework will provide a mechanism to target funding allocations on the basis of objective criteria, having regard to the drugs situation in the Task Force catchment areas and other demographic factors.  The Study will also inform the question of how best to align Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in order to address locally identified needs.

However, 2015 and 2016 have seen increases in the Health Budget, with investments in capital expansion and the implementation of measures designed to tackle overcrowding in EDs.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that patient experience times have improved in April 2016, with 67.6% of patients being admitted or discharged within 6 hours and 81.7% within 9 hours. </p>  <p>  In June 2015, &euro;18m of additional funding was made available under the 2015/16 Winter Additional Capacity Initiative.  As a result, 366 new or re-opened beds have been made available to date. </p>  <p>  Extended access to GP care and an expansion in services offered by GPs such as treatment for chronically ill patients, can help to reduce ED pressure.  There are currently 50 locations where primary care infrastructure is under construction, or, at an advanced planning stage. </p>  <p>  I attended the ED Taskforce Implementation Group meeting on Monday, which continues to be focussed on driving improved ED performance, achieving an integrated approach across Acute Hospitals, Primary Care and Social Care to the challenge of ED overcrowding.  At the meeting the Taskforce agreed to adopt a two-year approach to winter planning, and commence planning for Winters in 2016 and 2017.</p>  <p>  Capital expansion is also ongoing. New EDs are open at the Mater Hospital in Dublin and in Wexford General Hospital.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to progress new ED facilities for University Hospital Galway and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. </p>  <p>  A review of bed capacity in our health service, coupled with the review of the hours of service of Medical Assessment Units, are further key commitments in the Programme for Government that are intended to alleviate ED overcrowding.</p>  <p>  These increases in the health budget, measures to increase bed capacity, along with new ED facilities and maximising the potential of units and services to treat patients outside of the hospital setting will all contribute to improving ED waiting times for patients.</p></reply>

Reform is required across and between primary, social and acute care but it is also important to think on a whole system basis in terms of strategic enablers of reform.  These include organisational structures, workforce planning, better ICT systems, improved financial models and stronger  leadership and management capability.  These whole system functions are critical and can be core drivers of better, more integrated and more efficient services. </p><p>With these strategic reforms in mind, the<b></b>planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all of the various service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritise areas of greatest need.</p><p>One of the key proposals in the Programme for Government is the establishment of an Oireachtas Committee to develop cross-party consensus on the future of the health service.  I believe the health service would benefit enormously from a single unifying vision that we can all get behind and that can help to drive reform and development of the system over the next 10 years. </p><p>I am pleased that the House has agreed to move ahead quickly to establish this committee and to get it up and running in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

It is expected that the enabling works contractor will be appointed in the coming weeks, for commencement on site in July.  It is expected that the satellite centres can open in 2018, significantly enhancing access to urgent care and outpatient services for children from the Greater Dublin Area.

This provided the possibility of creating a subset of minor offences which are legally suitable to be dealt with by way of fixed penalty notices.</p>  <p>  In summary, the process suggested in the RIA involved giving a person who was alleged to have committed a minor offence an option to pay a fixed payment which would mean that a prosecution would not be taken in the Courts.  If the payment was not received within 28 days, the prosecution would be initiated in the courts and on conviction it was expected that a higher fine would be applied. </p>  <p>  A number of industry submissions received under the RIA on the implementation of fixed penalty notices raised concerns that these would be used in place of verbal or written warnings.  Other comments raised concerns regarding potential inequalities in the application of the system between different Sea Fisheries Protection Authority Port Officers and Naval Service personnel.  There were also comments regarding the constitutionality of applying sanctions in the absence of a Court decision and others seeking a fully administrative system.</p>  <p>  In light of the comments submitted in respect of the above proposal on a fixed penalty system, it was decided not to proceed with the introduction such a system.</p></reply>

Due to the severity of the breaches of the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme the penalties incurred were far greater than the total payable amount of the AEOS contract.  Therefore, the contract was terminated and the Department is recouping all monies paid under the Scheme. </p>  <p>  AEOS is a voluntary scheme where applicants agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions on joining the Scheme.  There are no circumstances where an applicant can receive payment for a contract where the Terms and Conditions are not adhered to.

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date</p>  <p>  Profits from the three Kinsale Area gas fields and the Corrib gas field are taxed at a rate of 25%. </p>  <p>  In addition royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads gas field nor from the Corrib gas field as Ireland moved from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.</p>  <p>  The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence or licensing option granted prior to January 2007 will be 25%.</p>  <p>  The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence or licensing option granted from January 2007 to May 2014 will be between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.</p>  <p>  The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence or licensing option granted from June 2014 onwards will be between 25% and 55% depending on the profitability of the field.  In addition there is a requirement for a minimum tax payment at a rate of 5% of gross revenues in every year that a field is selling production.</p>  <p>  The level of profits arising from a field depend on a combination of factors including the volume of recoverable gas or oil, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas or oil over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.</p>  <p>  The operation of the taxation system and the receipt of taxation are matters for the Revenue Commissioners.  As a consequence I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the current position as regards tax paid or due, or projected under hypothetical scenarios, to the Exchequer in respect of the four commercial gas fields.  In the case of existing exploration licences where exploration is ongoing, while we would hope for more commercial discoveries, it would not be possible to meaningfully estimate potential revenues from oil or gas fields that have yet to be discovered.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that it is both Government policy and the view of the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, as expressed in their May 2012 report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, that there should be no &ldquo;retroactive&rdquo; changes applying to discoveries made under existing exploration authorisations.</p></reply>

A Sustainable Energy Community aims to be energy efficient, to use renewable energy where feasible and to develop decentralised energy supplies.  The community can include all the different energy users in the community including homes, sports clubs, community centres, churches and businesses.</p>  <p>  26 community groups have become members of the Sustainable Energy Communities support network and 100 more have expressed an interest in becoming members. </p>  <p>  As a first step in the process, SEAI enters into a 3 year partnership agreements with communities, during which SEAI provides technical supports for groups to identify, plan, implement and review a tailored programme of activities for their community.</p>  <p>  For 2016, &euro;500,000 in capital funding has been made available to support the Sustainable Energy Communities network and my intention is to develop a multi-annual pipeline for the scheme that will build capacity in communities to take on more ambitious sustainable energy projects and projects of scale in the coming years.</p></reply>

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) funded the project and engaged Merrion Fleet to supply, manage and maintain the vehicles for the trial which included the cost of data collection and reporting.  The total value of the contract was &euro;247,000 including VAT.  The trial was part of a study to examine the potential benefits of an all electric energy system on an interconnected island.</p>  <p>  The tests results showed that energy imports to the islands could be reduced by 68% using an EV when compared to a comparably sized diesel car.  Should the islands produce their own electricity, this number could be reduced even further.  The island community adapted very well to the use of electric vehicles and have purchased a number of EVs with more modern technology than was used in the trial.  Assuming night rate electricity, the annual cost of the electricity was estimated to be 78% cheaper than the diesel equivalent.  The final report is being made available to the deputy and will be published on the SEAI website shortly.  There are currently no plans for further trials similar to the Aran Islands project.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. </p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.</p>  <p>  While I have no statutory authority or shareholder role to compel any network service provider to provide services in a given area my Department continues to actively monitor the progress of commercial operator plans and will in this context, examine the case which you have raised.  </p>  <p>  Over 750,000 premises are the focus of the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The five responses are being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlist of qualified bidders proceeding to the next stage of procurement.  </p>  <p>  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  Once contract(s) are in place, I expect to publish a detailed roll-out plan for the network.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband task forces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

This project is still at an early stage.</p></reply>
