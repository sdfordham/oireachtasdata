This Commission of Investigation arises on foot of the recommendations of Mr Se&aacute;n Guerin, SC, in his report of 6 May 2014 to An Taoiseach, based on his examination of how allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe concerning certain cases connected to the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division were handled. All of the matters recommended by Mr Guerin SC for inclusion in a Commission of Investigation are included in the terms of reference.</p>  <p>  The case referred to by the Deputy is amongst the complaints being considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach,  with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The review of each complaint will consist of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the panel.  Following the review of each complaint a recommendation will be made as to whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken.</p>  <p>  I would assure the Deputy that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur. However I would also make the point again that in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken. This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.</p>  <p>  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-15a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500050#WRA00800"><p>I first of all wish to assure the Deputy that there are currently no queues and all applicants for services at the public offices on Burgh Quay are dealt with on the same day.</p>  <p>  I have already provided the Deputy with a comprehensive response to a similar question on 11th  December last. The public offices in Burgh Quay service two separate functions &ndash; one dealing with non-EEA nationals seeking to register and renew their permission to be in the State, a function which is carried out by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and a separate function dealing with applicants for re-entry visas to allow for short trips outside the State, usually for holidays. This latter function is carried out by staff of Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and it is in connection with this function, rather than the registration function, that the issue with queuing arose before Christmas.</p>  <p>  As I informed the Deputy on that occasion, neither I, as Minister, nor my officials wish for any applicants for services provided by my Department to feel that they have to queue outside office hours for long periods, particularly in the cold weather conditions which prevailed at that time.  In this particular case, there is absolutely no need to do so because, unlike the registration functions, it is not a requirement of the re-entry visa applicants to turn up in person.  Applications may be made by registered post and many thousands of applications are processed annually in this way.</p>  <p>  That being said, there was, during December last, an unprecedented level of demand for re-entry visas &ndash; well above volumes of previous years.  Given this sudden increase in demand, decisive action was taken with significant additional resources re-deployed to the re-entry visa office with the result that by the end of the first week in December, all the postal applications on hand had been dealt with and all persons who came to the public office were dealt with on the same day. That continued to be the case right through December and is so to date.</p>  <p>  To avoid a recurrence of such unexpected demand and queues developing, I have asked my officials to bring forward their proposals for the introduction of an on-line appointment service for the re-entry visa process. Design of the system is underway and is now expected to be in place by the end of the first quarter of this year.</p>  <p>  This is part of the wider reform programme for the more effective and efficient delivery of immigration services which is underway.  This includes the transfer of registration functions from the GNIB to INIS.  This presents opportunities to streamline both registration and visa re-entry services and INIS will be extending its on-line services to the registration area as part of this process.</p>  <p>  In relation to the current registration process operated by the GNIB in Burgh Quay, this function is working normally with all callers being dealt with on the day so there is no requirement to queue for this service.</p>  <p>  Obviously, it would be ideal if all immigration related business could be done through the postal system (as can currently be done in the case of  re-entry visas) or through on-line services. However, in common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at the offices of the Minister. This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure. Accordingly, we must devise systems that meet the needs of our customers while at the same time maintaining appropriate checks and balances within the system. I believe the reform programme underway will achieve both of these aims.</p></reply>

This was introduced in early 2012 and has had considerable success.  As of the end of December 2014, 11,688 persons have been arrested, and charges have been brought against 6,711 persons under Operation Fiacla. <br/><br/>I am further advised that specific burglary related operations have been implemented in each Garda Region, in support of Operation Fiacla, to target suspect offenders, disrupt their activities and secure their attendance before the courts.<br/><br/><i>Operation Acer</i>commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) in March 2012.  Operation Acer is an intelligence driven operation; and includes analysis-led checkpoints and patrols to target specific areas and case-manage targeted offenders.  <i>Operation Acer</i>led to a reduction in burglaries in Dublin by 5% in 2013.<br/><br/>However it is accepted that has been an increase in recorded incidents of burglary in Dublin in recent months. This increase is worrying but I am advised that Gardai are responding to this increase, with a new operational response having been put in place as part of <i>Operation Acer. </i>This includes particular focus on identifying and targeting criminal groups who have played a large part in the recent increase.<br/><br/>A further and related operation, Operation Creeper, assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements.  As a result of the recent burglary increase in Dublin, this Operation has been tasked solely with targeting burglary suspects and several Acer targets have been arrested as a result.<br/><br/>Similar regional operations complement Operation Fiacla throughout the country and a key focus is the targeting of the highly mobile criminal gangs involved in burglary.  These groups are being identified and disrupted on a continuous basis by specialist Garda units.<br/><br/>All of these Garda initiatives operate alongside ongoing community policing measures, including ongoing liaison with businesses and households in providing crime prevention advice and assistance to victims of burglary.<br/><br/>My Department and I are continuing to engage closely with the Garda authorities about these measures and their impact, and I am determined that those who invade and disrupt the lives of the public in this way are dealt with robustly.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/>In addition to the Garda response, I have commenced a broader review of the Criminal Justice system&rsquo;s response to the problem of burglaries. This will include a particular focus on inter-agency measures in relation to offender management.<br/><br/>Insofar as the question of crime statistics are concerned, as the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the publication of such data rests with the Central Statistics Office as the national statistics agency.  Following the publication of the recent Garda Inspectorate Report on Crime Investigation, the CSO is carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Inspectorate and while this process is underway the CSO has not been in a position to publish more recent definitive figures.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-15a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500050#WRA01300"><p>On 27 November, I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2014, which amongst other proposals, creates two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.  My primary concern, in introducing these provisions, is to vindicate the human rights of those trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Over 80% of women trafficked are the victims of sexual exploitation.</p>  <p>  These proposals were developed following an extensive consultation process, initiated by my Department in 2012, including a Discussion Document which presented an objective analysis of the approaches adopted in other jurisdictions to address prostitution.  I would draw attention to a March 2014 Council of Europe Report entitled "Prostitution, trafficking and modern slavery in Europe".  That Report reviews the approaches adopted in a number of countries and concludes that member states should consider "criminalising the purchase of sexual services, based on the Swedish model, as the most effective tool for preventing and combating trafficking in human beings". There is no suggestion that this approach adopted by a number of countries is in conflict with international human rights requirements.  Indeed in February 2014, the European Parliament adopted a resolution advocating this approach.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has also recommended criminalising the purchase of sexual services by means of prostitution.</p>  <p>  Independent statistics on crime, including prostitution and related offences, are collated and published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  In addition to the material collated by the CSO, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of my Department has, since January 2009, operated a data collection strategy in relation to human trafficking.  The purpose of the strategy is to gain a more informed view of the nature and extent of trafficking in human beings in Ireland in terms of what was being encountered by both governmental and non-governmental organisations.  The data is published by the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit in its Annual Report.  Because of the hidden nature of these activities, there are limitations with relation to the statistics.  However this applies to all jurisdictions and I am not aware of any other approach that would provide more accurate and objective statistics.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the new offences is to send a clear message that the purchase of sexual services in the context of prostitution is unlawful and the evidence suggests that making an act unlawful does in itself influence behaviour.  There will of course be some prosecutions and of course as with any covert activity, this can present challenges.  The Deputy however will appreciate that this is an operational policing matter and one which will properly be dealt with by the Garda authorities, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.  The trafficking of persons and the organisation of prostitution is a feature of organised criminality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already strongly committed to the disruption of the organised crime networks behind this activity. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-15a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500050#WRA01500"><p>As the Deputy will no doubt recall, I requested the Garda  Inspectorate to consider the issues identified in the report by Se&aacute;n Guerin SC relating to Garda practices and procedures which come within the Inspectorate's remit. The Inspectorate included this work in its report on Crime Investigation which was published on 11 November 2014.  That report deals with the issues identified by Mr Guerin in an addendum, and groups them into themes which are covered in the main body of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report.  In respect of each theme, the addendum indicates the issues identified in the report by Mr Guerin, and relates them to the relevant findings and recommendations of the Inspectorate.<br/><br/>The Garda Inspectorate notes in its report that it was not within its remit to duplicate Mr. Guerin's work but rather it set out to review the process issues raised in his report which are relevant to Garda practices and procedures.  This was in the context of the Inspectorate's statutory remit to ensure that the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are used so as to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration.<br/><br/>The Inspectorate did not include any additional recommendations as a result of its consideration of the matters highlighted in the Guerin Report and concluded that the majority of the issues raised in the report in connection with crime investigation were consistent with the Inspectorate's findings as part of their overall examination of Garda practices and procedures.<br/><br/>As such the issues identified therefore fall to be addressed as part of the overall process to carry forward the recommendations contained in the Inspectorate Report.<br/><br/>In this regard, as the Deputy will be aware, when I published the Inspectorate report I welcomed it as forming an important component in the overall justice reform programme underway.  Implementation of this programme, including the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach.<br/><br/>There will also of course be a central role for the new Police Authority and Garda Commissioner in implementing the identified reforms.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has already taken important steps to follow through on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations with the establishment of an Implementation Steering Group to immediately focus on the implementation of the short<font color="#2F2F2F">,</font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report, and I am engaging with the new Commissioner on this process. In particular, the Garda Policing Plan is being revised to take into account changes being made as a result of the recommendations contained in the report.<br/><br/>In addition, in advance of the establishment of the Policing Authority, I intend to hold discussions with Josephine Feehily,  the Chairman-designate, on the establishment of an effective implementation framework to oversee delivery of reforms in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>I should add that the question of the appointment of a Secretary General is not an issue addressed in either the Guerin report or the Garda Inspectorate Report.</p></reply>

The Committee's recommendation was made in the context of its review of the operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. The Deputy will be aware of the comprehensive programme of Justice reform which is underway and the Government is grateful that it has had the benefit of the Committee's consideration of a wide range of matters relevant to the reform programme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the progress already made under the reform programme including the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner following the first ever open competition for the post, as well as the publication of proposals for important new legislation relating to the establishment of an independent Police Authority and also to strengthen of the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p>  <p>  Independent inspection is a valuable component in a properly functioning criminal justice system and it is for this reason that we already have well established inspection bodies in place in the form of the Garda Inspectorate and the Inspector of Prisons.   A proposal to establish an overarching inspection body is certainly worthy of further consideration but clearly it would need to take account of a wide range of factors, not the least of which would be the impact and interaction with these existing inspection models.  It would also be useful to study the experience derived from the operation of the Criminal Justice Inspection body in Northern Ireland, and to take into account of course its origin in the review of criminal justice arrangements which followed the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Such an examination would be a substantial exercise requiring extensive consultation and analysis and as such I would not be in a position to commit to any particular process in advance of making further progress on the immediate issues which have been identified as part of the justice sector reform programme.  Nevertheless I regard it as a helpful proposal which clearly deserves detailed consideration and I would be happy to discuss it further with the Committee at a suitable opportunity.</p></reply>

It is true that Garda strength has been affected by retirements, and that is why I was very pleased to be able to secure approval for the resumption of Garda recruitment.  As the Deputy will be aware, 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, the first intake of Garda recruits since 2009 . This was followed by an intake of a further 100 new recruits in December.  A further intake of 100 is due to enter training at the end of this month.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College since last September and is a measure of this Government's commitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The first intake of recruits will attest as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of this year and will be assigned to Garda Stations by the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  It is of course a key objective of the Garda Commissioner to allocate all of the resources at her disposal in a manner which maximises their impact on the protection of the public and on the prevention and detection of crime.  In that context, Garda management keep under continuing review developments in relation to security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  As part of this strategy, Garda management recognise the importance of responding to new and emerging crime trends and related issues. A recent example of a proactive Garda response is the coordinated approach being taken in the Dublin City centre area in which Garda&iacute; are acting in close cooperation with Dublin City Council, the Homeless Executive and the HSE to address a range of issues, including the anti-social behaviour in the City Centre area. I fully support the steps being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in cooperation with other stakeholders, and I am confident that policing measures such as these, in Dublin and across the country, will make a significant contribution to public safety.</p></reply>

This arises from the commitment in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 to legislate to reduce the length of time an asylum applicant spends in the direct provision system through the establishment of a single applications procedure.  In order to achieve the early implementation of a more streamlined procedure I am, therefore, proposing that the Government fast-track  specific legislation in the asylum area.  I am committed  to ensuring that this legislation be brought forward as a matter of urgency and I intend to publish the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill, once approved by Government, in the next few weeks. This fast-tracked legislation will deal with the key issues of qualification for international protection, examination and assessment of applications for international protection, the rights and entitlements of persons determined to be eligible for international protection and effective remedy against refusal of international protection. The Bill will be in compliance with the United Nations Refugee Convention and related EU Directives.</p>  <p>  My objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which remains very susceptible to judicial review and can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of direct provision for indeterminate periods of time.  The introduction of the single procedure, together with other reforms in the proposed Bill, will enhance our capacity to efficiently grant international protection to those who are entitled to it.  At the same time, it will identify, at a much earlier stage, persons who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.</p>  <p>  This approach does not lose sight of the other necessary elements of legislative reform in this area. Work on an Immigration and Residence Bill will also continue by reference to such further matters as the visa regime, entry into the State, residence, removal from the State while also dealing with specific challenges such as those of human trafficking and marriages of convenience. In this way any development of the respective Bills will give mutual support to the ongoing roll-out of reform of our immigration regime while also allowing the Government to be responsive to the present and very pressing need for a single procedure for the examination of applications for international protection in this jurisdiction.</p></reply>

I have met with the woman in question and I should say I admire her bravery in telling her story publicly.  It is a pity that those who have questions to answer in relation to her mistreatment could not find it in themselves to be as forthright and forthcoming.</p>  <p>  I have discussed this matter with the Northern Ireland Justice Minister, David Ford, on a number of occasions, most recently when we attended the Plenary Meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in Armagh in December last.  This provided us with an opportunity to discuss further the issues arising in respect of the allegations of sexual abuse committed by republican paramilitaries that have come to light in recent months.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is investigating information in this regard which it received towards the end of last year and these investigations are ongoing.  Inevitably, these will take some time to complete.  There are also specific, independent review and inquiry processes underway in Northern Ireland by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Police Ombudsman.  It is essential to allow the relevant authorities &ndash; the child protection and the police services and others &ndash; North and South to carry out their ongoing work in this regard unimpeded.  It is important also to continue to encourage people with any relevant information to come forward to the authorities.</p>  <p>  Given the strong public concern about potentially &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; child abusers in our communities, and given also the concerns of victims of abuse, I will continue to address with Minister Ford the need and potential for an additional inquiry or inquiries.  We will consider any issues which emerge from the current and ongoing reviews and inquiries, and we will keep in close contact to review progress with these.  I will meet with Minister Ford again in the near future and we will have an opportunity to review these issues.  We have tasked officials in the two Justice Departments to examine, in tandem with the various investigations that are under way, legal and practical issues that might arise relevant to the issue of the establishment of forms of inquiry, and they will report on this to me and Minister Ford.</p>  <p>  Of course, it is in the nature of it, that the establishment of an inquiry or parallel inquiry processes inevitably raises complex legal and other practical issues, and these complexities will have to be examined closely in order to ensure that where any such processes are put in place they would not simply become bogged down or derailed by legal complexity.</p>  <p>  I would add that there is a range of support services for victims of sexual abuse available in both jurisdictions.  Minister Ford and I will keep this under review and we will continue to work closely together in the context of the forthcoming implementation of the EU Victims&rsquo; Directive.</p></reply>

The Government is fully entitled to rely on these assurances. </p>  <p>  There is no question of the State having been complicit in the practice of extraordinary renditions.</p>  <p>  The recent report of the US Senate related to torture and renditions does not, I am pleased to note, mention Ireland in this regard.</p>  <p>  Statutory powers of search and entry are bestowed upon the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under various legislative provisions and when authorised by a judge.  However, these powers are exercised in circumstances where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reasonably suspects that an offence has occurred.  These powers can only be used, therefore, where a Garda has a reasonable suspicion supported by some evidence.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the general public is clearly insufficient in this regard.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has investigated a range of complaints of alleged unlawful activity at Shannon Airport and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of unlawful activity.</p>  <p>  Any person with credible information that Irish airports have been used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report their concerns to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Total expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid for the years 2009 to 2013 was as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;60.3 million</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;56.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;56.1 million</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;50.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;50.9 million</td></tr></table><br/><br/>In seeking to reduce the expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, the rates of fees paid to the legal practitioners were reduced by 8% in March 2009 and by a further 8% in April, 2010. There was also a reduction of 10% in July 2011 in the fees payable in the District Court. Fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts were also decreased by 10% in October 2011 following the reduction in the fees payable by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecution practitioners. A reduction of 50% was also applied to payments in respect of adjourned sentence hearings and travel and subsistence payments from 2011. As the Deputy will see from the figures above, following these and other measures introduced in the course of 2011, a 10% reduction in expenditure was recorded in 2012 compared with 2011. This was the first substantial reduction ever recorded under this Scheme. Expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to identifying any areas where further efficiencies may be achieved.<br/><br/>The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<br/><br/>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976] I.R. 325</i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. </i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<br/><br/>I can inform the Deputy that a  new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse.</p></reply>

The forum includes stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime, including the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers association, the Electricity Supply Board, telecoms, transport companies, brewing concerns and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p>  <p>  The metal theft plan is designed to provide for an effective and multi-agency response to the incidence of metal theft. In line with the framework set out in the plan, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is implementing a range of initiatives to tackle those involved in this form of criminality. This includes relevant actions under Operation Fiacla which is targeting in particular mobile gangs involved in burglary and other property crime, including metal theft. Operation Fiacla adopts a focused, targeted and co­ordinated approach to investigating mobile and organised criminal groups throughout the jurisdiction.  It is primarily an intelligence led operation with local, regional and national units all playing a key role.  The operation has had many successes in terms of disrupting those involved in this type of criminality and, as of 31 December 2014, has led to the arrest of 11,688 persons with charges being brought against 6,711 persons.</p>  <p>  With regard to the theft and sale of precious metals, and concerns in relation to 'cash for gold' outlets, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigates all reports where persons suspected of being involved in burglaries may be using cash for gold outlets to liquidate stolen property.  Where relevant issues are highlighted, investigations are conducted to target any criminality.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that I am committed to examining the best approach to regulation in the area of cash for gold business providers, having regard to the potentially significant impact on legitimate businesses. It is important to recognise that any legislation in this area would have a potentially significant impact on a broad range of businesses. There are a large number of legitimate businesses such as jewellers, antique dealers etc., as well as &lsquo;cash for gold&rsquo; outlets that would be impacted upon.  As the regulatory and resource burden of any proposed measure will have to be carefully examined to ensure that it is proportionate to the matter being addressed I have asked officials in my Department to carry out a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which will facilitate a process of consultation with groups likely to be affected.  The current position is that my Department is finalising a RIA which will comprise a detailed and systematic appraisal of the potential impacts of any proposed regulation in order to assess whether the regulation is likely to achieve the desired objectives and the potential costs that will arise.  It is my intention to publish this RIA for consultation in the near future.</p></reply>

Where sections 6A and 6B of that Act apply, a child born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 has an entitlement to Irish citizenship if, at the time of the birth of the child, one of his or her parents had, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years. </p>  <p>  Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.  </p>  <p>  Entitlement of a child born in the State to Irish citizenship is determined by making an application for an Irish passport on behalf of the child to the Passport Office. However, entitlement to Irish citizenship under Section 6(3) is determined by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, as is the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children born in Northern Ireland to certain foreign nationals. Children of Non-EEA/Swiss parents who do not meet the residency requirements, do not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship. However, in this case, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State.  This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation.</p>  <p>  In addition, a certificate of nationality can be issued to a person as evidence that they were, as of the date of issue, an Irish citizen. The cases in question were referred to the Citizenship Division for consideration in respect of children born in the State. I can inform the Deputy that a formal liaison arrangement between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was agreed last year and has been put in place, provides a mechanism for dealing with exceptional cases as well as ongoing consultation in relation to citizenship and passport matters in general. </p>  <p>  As indicated in the Ombudsman's Report,  my Department is working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to evaluate the potential for streamlining the system dealing with the employment and immigration status of non-EEA workers where currently two entirely separate application processes are required.  This evaluation is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The question of extending the remit of the Ombudsman is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and that remit was significantly extended under the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012. However, after careful consideration of all the issues involved, it was determined that the administration of the law relating to immigration or naturalisation, should not be within the scope of the Ombudsman. Part of the consideration was the fact that there are already a significant number of appeal processes built into the system including Judicial Reviews. That said, the matter will be kept under review.  I should also add that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has administrative arrangements in place with the Ombudsman's Office to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention. </p>  <p>  The present provisions governing Jus Soli entitlement to Irish citizenship were enacted following the Twenty-Seventh Amendment of the Constitution inserting Article 9.2, which provides that a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law. The change proposed by the Deputy would render Article 9.2 of the constitution moot and I have no plans to amend the legislation in this way.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-15a.105.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500052#WRC01400"><p>Social insurance contributions (PRSI) are paid into the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) which finances a broad range of benefits.  The social insurance system is mandatory and insures nearly all workers and the self-employed for a range of contingencies such as old age, ill health, maternity and unemployment.  The range of contingencies covered is dependent on the Class of PRSI paid.</p>  <p>  Social insurance spending has traditionally been funded on a tripartite basis &ndash; with contributions coming from the Exchequer, employers and employees.  Legally, the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and Exchequer contributions were the norm for over 40 years.  The Revised Estimates for 2014 provided for a subvention of &euro;690 million from voted expenditure to fund the deficit on the SIF with the Revised Estimates provision in 2015 being &euro;180 million, a reduction of over half a billion euro.</p>  <p>  One of my key priorities as Minister for Social Protection is to put the Social Insurance Fund on a sustainable footing.  A core principle of sustainable social protection systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions. </p>  <p>  The structural PRSI measures implemented in recent Budgets will have a positive and long-term impact on the funding of the SIF.  These measures include increases in rates of contribution, the abolition of ceilings for charging PRSI, the abolition of relief from PRSI previously applied to employee pension contributions, the abolition of the PRSI-free allowance as well as the broadening of the base on which PRSI is charged through the abolition of exemptions.  These revenue raising measures were accompanied by expenditure reducing measures including stricter contribution conditions for entitlement, reductions in duration of entitlement, removal of entitlement to concurrent social insurance payments, increases in pension age as well as major reductions in entitlements under the treatment benefits and redundancy payments schemes.  As I have already indicated the 2015 Revised Estimate provides for the Exchequer Subvention to fall to &euro;180 million in 2015.</p>  <p>  The sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund is driven by: </p>  <p>  i. Social Insurance Fund Income from PRSI receipts; </p>  <p>  ii. Expenditure on SIF schemes &ndash; the main variables being demographic pressures relating to pensions and the Live Register. </p>  <p>  Social Insurance Fund income peaked at over &euro;8.1 billion in 2008.  It fell to &euro;6.7 billion by 2010.  The 2015 Budget Estimate forecast that it will be &euro;8.2 billion this year, exceeding the pre-crash value for the first time. </p>  <p>  Arising from demographic pressures, expenditure on pensions is increasing by &euro;200 million each year.  The Live Register rose from an average of 162,000 in 2007 to over 440,000 in 2010 and 2011.  It has since fallen each year and is expected to average below 390,000 in 2014. </p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December, 2010, highlighted the growing deficit in the Fund and the prospect that it will, in the absence of measures to address the deficit, accelerate further in the future, driven primarily by pension costs.  It is estimated that almost &euro;1 billion additional provision will be required over the next 5 years to fund increases in the numbers of recipients of the State pension (contributory) scheme. </p>  <p>  Based on macro-economic forecasts provided by the Department of Finance, it is expected that Social Insurance Fund income will continue to rise over the period 2016 to 2018 by an amount greater than the requirement for additional pension expenditure. </p></reply>

Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only. The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.  <br/><br/>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at .  The following are the key findings of the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges undertaken by my Department:<br/><br/>- net fee and commission income divided by average assets in Irish banks was well below the average of their peers,<br/><br/>- net fees and commissions are lower in the Irish banks than in their European peers relative to net interest income,<br/><br/>- fee and commission income have become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years and banks have been able to increase fee and commission income since 2009 despite the restrictions imposed by section 149,<br/><br/>- Section 149 does appear to exert a restraining effect on the development of innovative products by the existing banks in Ireland but this may not be to the detriment of consumers,<br/><br/>- Section 149 may lead to inefficiency in pricing of financial products by the banks in Ireland, and <br/><br/>- Low customer mobility may mean that banks can increase prices without fearing a loss of customers.<br/><br/>The review also found that competition in the Irish banking sector has reduced significantly since the onset of the economic crisis and that this reduction is not related to Section 149.  The review considered a number of possible changes to the existing regime but concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 at this point in time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the removal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks. The Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013 did introduce changes to Section 149 to attract new entrants to the Irish banking sector. There is some evidence of improvement in the banking sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.<br/><br/>I would advise consumers who wish to compare current account offerings to look at  the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission  website at .</p></reply>

Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation;</p>  <p>  - Following a joint process with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom, a new, more effective fuel marker was identified and will be implemented in the two jurisdictions from the end of March next; and</p>  <p>  - Intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations. </p>  <p>  In addition, I introduced a 'reckless trading' provision In Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that makes a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded. This provision has strengthened Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers.  In Finance Act 2014, I introduced provisions to strengthen further Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information. Revenue's strategy has already yielded significant results. Since mid-2011, 137 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions, over three million litres of fuel have been seized and 31 oil laundries were detected and closed down.  Industry sources indicate a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and road diesel consumption and tax revenues are up 13% compared with a couple of years ago. Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth but reduced fraud is an important factor.  It has been suggested on a number of occasions that the current system of marking lower taxed fuels should be replaced by one based on repayments to the users.  However, a change of this nature would impact on a wide range of users, would be costly to implement and would, itself, be at risk from fraud.  Marked gas oil has a wide variety of uses, including the propulsion of trains, in agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, for commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and commercial and home heating purposes.  A change to a rebate system would involve the establishment of an expensive and wide-ranging repayments system and would place a new administrative burden on oil traders, on the large number of users and the Revenue Commissioners. It would also impose significant cash-flow costs on those currently using marked gas oil. Repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging repayment scheme would not offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.  Fuel in respect of which a repayment of duty was made could be easily diverted to on-road use.  </p>  <p>  For these reasons, and in light of the progress made by Revenue in tackling the problem, I am satisfied that the strategy being implemented by Revenue is the best course of action. I am also confident that the introduction of the new marker here and in the United Kingdom from the end of March will reinforce the measures already implemented.</p></reply>

This compares with &euro;13.1 billion at end 2013.</p>  <p>  Much of the banking-related work in the Department of Finance this year will focus on AIB. Given the scale of the State s investment   some &euro;20.8 billion   and the range of options available to recoup value from the bank, officials within my department are working with AIB on reconfiguring its capital structure. Goldman Sachs International has been appointed to provide financial advice in this regard. </p>  <p>  The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time. While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer. All options remain on the table and it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or to put a timeline on decisions.</p></reply>

At the household level, lower energy prices are likely to lead to an increase in real disposable incomes, which can be used to reduce indebtedness or increase consumption on other goods and services. </p>  <p>  A reasonable rule of thumb - everything else being equal - is that each sustained &euro;10 per barrel reduction in the price of oil boosts the level of real GDP by between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points.</p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that the decline in oil prices will also reduce inflation.  At the level of the euro area, the latest figures show that inflation moved into negative territory in December for the first time since 2009.  Falling oil prices will further weigh on inflation in the short-term.  If expectations of falling prices were to become entrenched, the negative impact on the euro area economy could potentially be severe. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of  compiling my Department's macroeconomic forecasts, my officials make the purely technical assumption that Brent crude oil prices will move in line with futures prices. The latest forecasts, which were published for Budget 2015, included the assumption that the price of Brent crude oil in 2015 would be $103 per barrel.  Prices have fallen by close to 50 per cent since these macroeconomic projections were finalised in late September 2014.  My Department will update its oil price assumptions in the next round of forecasting in April 2015. In the meantime, my Department willl continue to monitor oil price developments closely.</p></reply>

I can also confirm that Goldman Sachs International has been engaged on a pro bono basis. This is a good outcome for the State and we understand is not unusual internationally given firms desire to be associated with such high visibility government work. In fact a number of the tenderers offered their services on a pro bono basis.  <br/><br/>The award follows the establishment by the Department last year of three separate panels of financial advisers. These panels were put in place to principally facilitate the provision of timely advice in relation to our banking investments though the panels are available for the wider Department to use in other areas if deemed necessary.<br/><br/>The award of the current contract followed a competitive tendering process with each of the eleven firms on Panel 1 (which covers capital markets, strategic, M&amp;amp;A and restructuring advice) being invited to submit a tender. Prior to the year end, each of the firms accepted the invitation and the tendering process included face-to-face presentations by each of the firms to a panel of Department of Finance officials. Arising from these presentations, each of the firms was scored across a number of standard criteria with Goldman Sachs International being adjudged to have achieved the highest aggregated score. Accordingly, they were awarded the contract.<br/><br/>As I have indicated previously, no decision has been taken in relation to the State exiting any of its investments in AIB. What we intend to do during the first half of 2015 is make the bank's balance sheet fit for purpose and put together a roadmap that will see the bank start to return cash to the State. Upon completion of this work we will take stock of our options with respect to the future ownership of the bank.<br/><br/>Details of the firms included on Panel 1 can be found on the Department's website and I attach the following link for the benefit of the Deputy. <br/><br/></p></reply>

Furthermore the Government agreed to continue with the practice of excluding the payment of bonus provisions in the employment contracts of newly appointed CEOs to such State Companies as well as in respect of contract renewals for incumbent CEOs. </p>  <p>  The requirement to cease such forms of bonus payment together with other basic salary reductions introduced by this Government in respect of the CEOs in State Companies was necessitated by the very difficult financial and economic circumstances facing this country.  The Government will accordingly continue to consider future policy developments in relation to performance related pay for the CEOs concerned in the light of prevailing circumstances.    </p></reply>

The site will be fully assessed after the winter, any hazards cleared from public areas and any necessary repairs carried out.</p>  <p>  Given the need for these essential preparatory works in advance of opening the island to the public, and having regard to dependence on weather, I regret that it is not possible to open the island earlier.</p></reply>

Specifically, they were asked to outline their capital investment plans for the five year period ahead.  My Department also consulted external stakeholders such as the ESRI, the CIF and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, for their views on what the State's main infrastructure priorities for the period ahead should be.  Alongside these consultations, officials within my Department conducted analysis on particular areas and aspects of capital expenditure.  It is my intention that the submissions and papers which informed the capital review will be made available on my Department's website once the report on the review is published.</p>  <p>  Government has made its decision on the capital allocations for the next three years and these were set out in Budget 2015.  The report of the capital review is being finalised and I intend to publish it in the coming weeks.

The PAS operates under licence from the Commission for Public Service Appointments and is independent in its operations.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy does not stipulate a particular competition, PAS has confirmed that the individual for whom details were supplied was a candidate for the Temporary Clerical Officer (TCO) campaign which is run annually to meet gaps arising on foot of term-time leave, maternity leave and other short-term staff needs.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the TCO campaign attracted 13,200 applications.  Given the scale of interest in the competition and urgency of temporary assignments, PAS does not have scope to delay if a candidate cannot take up duty promptly.  The Information Booklet for the competition is clear in terms of the obligation on candidates to be available to take up duty when required and to see out the contract.</p>  <p>  The needs of departments/offices seeking TCO cover are immediate and typically short-term and as such the system must be responsive.  Given the size and complexity of the TCO competition with multiple regional panels and a fast moving process, it would not be feasible for PAS to keep track of candidates who are not available when required but may subsequently become available. </p>  <p>  In the specific case raised by the Deputy, the candidate had applied for both the TCO-2013 campaign and the TCO-2014 campaign.  He was successfully placed on the panel for Dublin on both occasions.  He was  assigned from the TCO-2013 panel in February 2014, which was quite late in the currency of that panel.  As he performed better in the TCO-2014 competition and was placed higher on the panel for Dublin he was offered a position from the TCO-2014 panel in April 2014.  The juxtaposition of a late offer from TCO-2013 and an early offer from TCO-2014 led to an overlap.  However, it should be noted that the 2013 and 2014 TCO recruitment campaigns were entirely separate competitions.  Candidates are entitled to apply for any number of concurrent PAS campaigns for permanent or temporary positions, but must ultimately make a decision on which offer to take if offers coincide.</p></reply>

Due to client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, IDA Ireland does not comment on upcoming visits by clients.<br/><br/>At the end of<b></b>2014 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,874 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.  When marketing Kerry for new inward investment IDA Ireland focuses on the ICT (incl. software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors. <br/><br/>2014 marks the end of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s 5 year Strategy &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo;.  The Agency is currently finalising its new Strategy for the coming 5 years.  I look forward to launching the new strategy, detailing goals and the broad direction IDA Ireland will take to accomplish them over the next five years.  <br/><br/>I have been working with my Department on the development of a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential.  A key element of this process is the Regional Enterprise Forum, which I chaired in Athlone on 19<sup>th</sup>December last.  I hope to publish the framework strategy shortly.  The Regional strategy will be rolled out firstly in the Midlands before being rolled out in other regions and will include specific actions and targets on the part of my Department, the enterprise development agencies and other public bodies to promote enterprise growth and job creation in the region.</p></reply>

This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the Union.  Regional Aid is also provided under Schemes for tourism grants, marine tourism, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.  All such aid come from the Exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding.  The 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines entered into force on 1 July 2014.  Areas accounting for 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population are now eligible for assistance under the Regional Aid Guidelines.  This represents a substantial increase from the 25% originally proposed by the Commission, and an increase from the 50% under the 2007-2013 Map.  This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are now available in Kerry.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines specify the grant aid rates for Regional Aid projects.  The Deputy is correct in acknowledging an improvement in the aid rate applicable for eligible projects in Kerry.  This specifically relates to the aid rate for large companies, which has increased from 0% to 10% for the period 2014-2020.  The Regional aid rates for Kerry and other areas designated under the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines are a maximum of 30% for small and micro enterprises, 20% for medium-sized enterprises and 10% for large enterprises.</p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2014, Enterprise Ireland has not to date, approved Regional Aid to any large company in Kerry.  However the Agency is working proactively with large clients as well as SME clients in Kerry to identify suitable growth projects for investment.  In the six months since 1  July 2014, Enterprise Ireland approved more than &euro;5.7 million to companies in Kerry for start-up, research and development, and expansion projects.  All projects are subject to assessment in terms of commercial, technical and market due diligence and should represent value for money in terms of the State&rsquo;s investment.</p>  <p>  During 2014, there were no public investment announcements of IDA Ireland projects for County Kerry.  However, it should be noted that not all companies agree to announce their investments and as a result, this does not truly reflect the level of investments won or the performance of FDI in a county in a particular year.  In this respect, IDA Ireland clients had a very positive employment performance in County Kerry with a net increase of 236 jobs in 2014, compared with 2013.</p>  <p>  Kerry Local Enterprise Office continues to work with its micro enterprise client base in Kerry.</p></reply>

Details of the number of jobs created and lost in each of those years is set out in the following tabular statement.  This strong job-creation performance took place against a particularly challenging European economic environment and changing corporate taxation landscape.  FDI is a key stimulator and driver of the Irish economy through its contribution to Exchequer finances.  The high calibre jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies and the indirect employment spin offs they generate in the Irish economy are making a vital contribution to this Government&rsquo;s ambition to have 100,000 people in work by 2016.<br/><br/>2014 marks the end of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s 5-year strategy &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; and I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that the Agency exceeded the jobs and investment targets it set itself under that strategy.  The Agency is currently finalising its new strategy for the coming five years.  I look forward in the next few weeks to launching the new strategy, detailing the goals and broad direction IDA Ireland will take to accomplish them over the next five years.<br/><br/><b>Table showing total number of jobs in IDA Ireland client companies together with the number of new Jobs created and lost in each year  from 2008 to 2014.</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Total Jobs</td><td>159,556</td><td>144,612</td><td>146,628</td><td>152,223</td><td>159,191</td><td>167,357</td><td>174,488</td></tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (Gross Gains)</td><td>10,943</td><td>6,265</td><td>14,308</td><td>14,432</td><td>15,215</td><td>15,104</td><td>15,012</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Losses</td><td>-14,263</td><td>-21,209</td><td>-12,292</td><td>-8,837</td><td>-8,247</td><td>-6,938</td><td>-7,881</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The European Court of Justice declared in case C418/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of the authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.</p>  <p>  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.</p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to achieve full compliance with the relevant Directives through a multi-annual work programme. A key factor of this Work Programme is the identification of prioritised bays based on the number of aquaculture sites, the ready availability of scientific data and other factors.</p>  <p>  Over 200 licences have been issued in the past three years in relation to bays, including Inner Bantry Bay, Roaringwater Bay, Killary Harbour and Castlemaine Harbour. There are in the region of 600 applications awaiting determination. The average timeframe for processing each particular application varies depending on location, species, scale and intensity of production, statutory status of sites, potential visual impact etc. Other factors include consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period. It is anticipated that significant progress will be made in licensing bays in 2015. The list of bays is kept under continuous review by my Department so as to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays.</p>  <p>  The development of the industry and the creation of long term employment from aquaculture can only take place if there is full compliance with the range of EU Directives which impact on this area and national legislation on environmental protection.</p>  <p>  There is great potential for all types of aquaculture around our coast as set out in &lsquo;Food Harvest 2020 &ndash; A Vision for Irish Agri-food and Fisheries&rsquo; and the steps outlined above, together with the work being done by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute, will result in the sustainable development of this important industry.</p></reply>

This information is contained in &lsquo;The Stock Book&rsquo; which is available on the Marine Institutes website at .<br/><br/>With regard to boarfish and the management advice for 2015, the Marine Institute advised that it considered that the long term management plan developed by the Pelagic Advisory Council (a body made up of all relevant EU stakeholders and funded by the EU Commission) should be followed. The difficulty is that this plan has not yet been fully evaluated by ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Seas) and therefore cannot be adopted by the EU. It is ICES advice that underpins the annual total allowable catch (TAC) proposals from the Commission for all stocks.<br/><br/>The MI have advised me that there remain some difficulties in the methodology used to assess the state of the boarfish biomass but that it is hoped that new surveys this year will provide the data that will allow ICES to complete its evaluation of the proposed management plan.<br/><br/>For the moment, boarfish is classed as a &lsquo;data limited stock&rsquo; and therefore the Commission proposed a precautionary approach to the TAC for 2015, reducing Ireland&rsquo;s quota to 36,830 tonnes. I accepted the advice of the Marine Institute and ICES and that of the Pelagic Advisory Council and supported this precautionary quota reduction at the annual December Fisheries Council.</p></reply>

This is particularly true of a huge market like the US, even more so given we are the first EU member State to secure such access which I believe is testimony to the quality and production values associated with Irish beef.  The total US beef market is estimated at 11 million metric tonnes. It is split 60: 40 between food service and grocery retail (by volume). The US imports 1.2m tonnes of beef every year and demand for Irish beef there is expected to be immediate and exceptionally strong.  I know that some of the leading Irish beef exporters have had people on the ground in the US for some time now in preparation for this announcement and they are reporting huge opportunities for Irish companies when the trade commences.  Bord Bia has identified the primary target for US market entry as key culinary centres such as New York City, Boston and Washington DC, followed by listings in premium grocery retailers initially in the North Eastern states.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the opening of any new market is good news for our beef producers, bringing as it does new outlets and new market opportunities which ultimately form the basis for the returns to the primary producers.  Irish farmers undertake a variety of beef production systems and the specific practice of raising beef weanlings should benefit from the opening of the US market given that weanling prices are influenced by deadweight prices achieved through meat factories and by future projections of supply and demand, both in Ireland and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  As regards the coming year, the forecast is for some slight improvement in Irish cattle prices in 2015 as a result of tighter Irish cattle supplies and a shift in the UK beef supply and use balance. While there are a number of factors which can of course influence the market, I am hopeful that Irish weanling prices should also increase in line with this movement in finished cattle prices.</p></reply>

It is not possible to be precise in quantifying the benefits that might accrue to farmers this year arising from the recent fuel price falls. However I would expect that some indirect benefits may arise through downward pressure in contracting charges and fertiliser costs, although other factors may mitigate the extent to which these costs may fall. These factors include profitability challenges in the contracting sector and falling fertiliser manufacturing capacity in Europe over the past 10 years, which has reduced market supplies. Feed costs are not as heavily impacted by fuel prices and, although the costs of drying, processing and transport will be reduced, other factors will come into play such as global growing and harvest conditions in 2015.</p>  <p>  On a broader level I note and welcome the fact that generally input prices are falling, as the CSO&rsquo;s agricultural input price index was down 3.5% on annual basis in November 2014 compared with November 2013. This is an indication that, amongst other things, the recent fall in fuel prices is already having a real and measurable impact.</p></reply>

However, there have been significant developments recently regarding China. Following political, technical and diplomatic engagement with the Chinese authorities over several years, the Chinese Ministers for Agriculture and for Quarantine and Inspection Services agreed, during my trade mission in November 2014, to send an inspection team to audit Ireland&rsquo;s beef production system and BSE controls in particular, with a view to removing the ban on Irish beef.</p>  <p>  The Inspection Team (comprising delegates from the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)) duly visited Ireland from 10-20 December 2014. They also visited laboratories, meat plants, rendering plants, cattle farms and a feed mill. My Department is currently awaiting the report of the visit.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Irish Embassy in Beijing will continue to engage with the Chinese authorities in order to progress this matter with a view to obtaining access to the Chinese market for Irish beef in the near future.</p></reply>

In order to ensure compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, an Appropriate Assessment has to be carried out before any aquaculture licensing determination may be made in respect of aquaculture applications for sites in the bay.  My Department is working with the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to achieve full compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives through a multi-annual work programme. This programme required the gathering of the necessary baseline data appropriate to the Conservation Objectives of aquaculture sites located within designated Natura areas. This data collection programme, which is substantially complete, together with the setting of Conservation Objectives, will enable all new and renewal aquaculture applications to be assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. This work is ongoing and a great deal of progress has been made to date.</p>  <p>  The Appropriate Assessment process has been completed in respect of a number of bays. While these Appropriate Assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually. Factors to be considered include location of the site within the bay, species, scale, etc. In addition to the Natura requirements, under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment. This requires significant input from the Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors. All applications, in compliance with the requirements of the Aarhus Directive, are advertised in order to facilitate public consultation, and submissions or observations received must be considered as part of the licence application determination process.</p>  <p>  The list of bays is kept under continuous review by my Department so as to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays. A completion timeline for a number of bays, including Gweedore, is part of this review process. Every effort is being made to expedite the completion of the overall process as a priority, having regard to the need to comply with all national and EU legislation.</p></reply>

For ease of reference this is set out hereunder.<blockquote><i>The first thing I want to emphasise is that I as Minister for Justice and Equality have no role in relation to prosecutions or decisions whether or not to initiate a prosecution.</i><br /><br /><i>In May 2013, the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) made a Report to my predecessor under Section 80(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 following its investigation into allegations of collusion between an individual and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</i><br /><br /><i>In its letter accompanying the report GSOC stated that a file relating to its public interest investigation was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Having considered the file the DPP advised that the file did not warrant prosecution of any individual.  Thereafter GSOC considered and decided against launching any investigation of matters which may constitute indiscipline.</i><br /><br /><i>The Report by GSOC also contained a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </i><br /><br /><i>At the time my predecessor sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  In response, the Garda Commissioner pointed that following the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources  many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures.  The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as agents provocateur. </i><br /><br /><i>I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court.  Mr Justice Smyth's report for 2012 has been published and I am currently making arrangements to publish his reports for 2013 and 2014.  I am pleased to note that the Judge has indicated that he received full cooperation  from relevant members of An Garda Siochana  in compiling his report and he records substantial compliance with the code of practice by An Garda Siochana.</i><br /><br /><i>I should mention that the recent Inspectorate report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the handling of information and these will be addressed.</i><br /><br /><i>A Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters, agreed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has been in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC since the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in 2007.  However, a new Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters has been agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC and was signed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23rd September, 2013.  The Memorandum of Understanding agrees protocols for operational matters between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, including the provision of information to GSOC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</i><br /><br /><i>There is continued ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC to address any issues that arise during the course of an investigation.  A working relationship is maintained between the two organisations with regular formal and informal meetings between senior management representatives.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office (GSOC Liaison Office) to process and monitor all such requests and ensure that all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner. </i><br /><br /><i>In the context of Garda oversight generally, the Deputy will be aware that I recently introduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment)(No. 3) Bill 2014.  The main purpose of the Bill  is to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  The Bill will bring the Garda Commissioner within the remit of GSOC for the first time.  It will also ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides information sought by GSOC for an investigation as soon as practicable.&quot;</i></blockquote>Promotions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to all ranks from Sergeant to Assistant Commissioner (inclusive) are covered by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Promotion Regulations of 2006 () and I have no involvement in the selection process.  While it would clearly not be appropriate to comment on individuals persons selected, I am not aware that any person has been selected  who remains under investigation as outlined by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Existing arrangements fall into two distinct categories: Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.<br/><br/>Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's identified operational needs and priorities.  Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that current Garda CCTV arrangements are kept under ongoing review in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's operational requirements.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>I am further informed that there are currently no plans to extend existing Garda CCTV systems.<br/><br/>A community-based CCTV Scheme was launched in 2005. This scheme provided financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of a local community CCTV system. Two major rounds of funding were advertised under that scheme.<br/><br/>The current position is that all available funding provided under the previous two rounds has been fully allocated and there are currently no plans to further extend the Scheme. However, the matter will continue to be kept under ongoing review in the context of overall policy considerations and the availability of funding.<br/><br/>I should also mention, as a further example of how technology is assisting in community policing, the Garda Text Alert Scheme, which was launched in September 2013.  This scheme provides a further mechanism for Garda&iacute; to provide crime prevention information to community contacts who in turn forward the information to all members of a community group. This initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 500 local groups involving in excess of 100,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme. I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups.<br/><br/>The further development and application of technology by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner and I will of course give careful consideration to any future proposals which she may make in this regard.</p></reply>

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and for the removal of body organs.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>This legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with new forms of exploitation, for forced begging and forced criminal activities, being provided for in new legislation. The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking)(Amendment) Act 2013 also provided, for the first time, a definition of 'forced labour' in Irish law, based on the International Labour Organisation's definition.<br/><br/>I am, of course, committed to keeping under review the adequacy of the measures taken to combat human trafficking, including legislation. In that context, I published on 27 November 2014 the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2014 which includes two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services. The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence. <br/><br/>Unlike the existing offences relating to prostitution such as soliciting, loitering or brothel keeping, the new offences will specifically target the demand for prostitution. It is estimated that over 80% of persons trafficked in Europe are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  The purpose of this new legislation is to reduce the demand for the services of victims of human trafficking who are being sexually exploited in prostitution.</p></reply>

It broadly describes a range of non-violent crimes that people in positions of responsibility and trust commit for their own personal gain. It can cover fraud, embezzlement, insider trading on the stock market, bribery, corruption and regulatory offences in specialist fields such as financial activity, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, and food safety.  My Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption.  Other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments.<br/><br/>There is extensive legislation on the statute book addressing white collar and corporate crime and amendments to this legislation are also considered in the light of the experience of law enforcement agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in operating the legislation and in light of relevant court rulings.  Where there is an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions in the law, I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals. <br/><br/>I would draw the Deputy's particular attention to the Criminal Justice Act 2011, as a recent example of such developments in white collar crime legislation, and one which represents an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in current and future investigations of white collar crime.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences (&ldquo;relevant offences&rdquo;) attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. The Act will provide vital assistance to the Garda&iacute; in the completion of current and future investigations.<br/><br/>Another recent provision of relevance to white collar crime is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions, which give effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Jury Service, are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial.<br/><br/>While the breadth and diversity of the issues faced in addressing serious, organised and white collar crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address it in all its facets, the overall body of legislation in place is comprehensive and, as I have outlined, is continuously under review and development in light of operational experience and other relevant considerations.<br/><br/>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which will be published in the coming months.  The Bill will:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>-replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in the old legislation<br /><br />-address the bribery of foreign public officials<br /><br />-provide for the liability of corporate bodies for the corrupt actions of their directors, employees and agents<br /><br />-include discrete offences outlawing trading in influence<br /><br />-take account of the Mahon Tribunal recommendations to criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends to use them as bribes</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>The Bill is also intended to enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments such as:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>-where an interested party makes a payment to a public official;<br /><br />-where a public official has failed to declare interests as required by ethics legislation; and<br /><br />-where an official accepts a gift in breach of ethical or disciplinary codes.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>Penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines are envisaged for persons convicted on indictment.  It is also intended to allow a judge to order a public official convicted of an offence to forfeit their office and exclude them from seeking public office for a period of years.  These forfeiture provisions will apply to senior office holders as well as a wide range of civil and public servants.</p></reply>

The Deputy might wish to note that at EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  This is the approach that has been consistently followed by successive Ministers in this respect.  It is open to a person who is in the situation referred to by the Deputy to seek to have their case considered on its merits and to respect the decision that is ultimately made.   In some cases that decision would result in their being granted leave to remain.  In other instances they would be required to leave the State.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns on this issue, it is the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.  It does not follow that a Stamp 4 immigration permission, which is generally seen as being the most sought after immigration status,  should be conferred on a broad basis on persons who have lived here illegally while others who have complied with all of the immigration rules enjoy a lesser status.</p></reply>

This  includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support frontline Garda&iacute; and intelligence led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Commissioner as provided for under Section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which includes commitments to target individuals and groups engaged in organised criminal activity and terrorism.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.</p>  <p>  In the area of forensics the situation is that the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, scheduled to become operational shortly, which was established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014.</p>  <p>  I have also clearly signalled my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address deficits which were identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for additional resources across a number of areas will be examined within that context.  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has commenced an in-depth examination of all recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report with a view to determining what can be  implemented in the short, medium and long term.  I also look forward to the significant contribution to this process of reform that will be made by the new policing authority which is to be established shortly.</p>  <p>  There have been other recent positive developments with regard to the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An intake of 200 new recruits, including 25 reserve Garda&iacute;, commenced training in 2014 and a further 100 recruits  are due to enter the training college at the end of this month.  I also secured an additional investment of &euro;10 million for the Garda fleet last year.</p></reply>

Of this 3,169 were serving prison sentences.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, health care, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services. which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.</p>  <p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.</p>  <p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision of higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p>  <p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour.</p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody aiming to give useful skills and serve the purpose of promoting rehabilitation.  Training activities are designed to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  The areas include catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, woodwork, construction, industrial skills and gym.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.  Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p>  <p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that figures that the latest available figures (22/11/14 - 28/11/14) show that an overall total of 1,816 offenders participated in Education activities which represents almost 48% of the prisoner population at that time.</p>  <p>  Similarly an average of 1,051 prisoners engaged in vocational training activities each day in November and this represents 28% of the average prison population in that month. It should be noted that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity.</p></reply>

Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of over 43%.</p>  <p>  2013 saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007. There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure.</p>  <p>  In addition, a 40 month capital programme is being implemented to eliminate slopping out and to improve prison conditions in the older part of the prison estate.  I am advised by my officials that work is continuing on the modernisation project at Mountjoy prison.  "D" Wing is the last wing in Mountjoy requiring refurbishment and on the completion of this, all cells in Mountjoy prison will have in cell sanitation facilities.  Works commenced in early June, 2014 with a completion date of the second quarter in 2015.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons in 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  An examination of yesterday's figures when there was 3,612 prisoners in custody shows that only Cork, Limerick and Arbour Hill are outside the parameters set by the Inspector of Prisons. This figure was 91% of his recommended total of 3, 982.</p>  <p>  In relation to Cork Prison, a contract for the construction of a new prison to replace the existing facility was awarded late last year and construction began in January, 2014 with a completion date on the third quarter of 2015.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that plans in respect of the Limerick Prison Redevelopment Project  are advancing well.</p>  <p>  Finally, the average number in custody for 2014 was 3,916 a reduction of 10.8% on the 2011 average of 4,390.  The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011.  Today there are 973 less prisoners in custody which represents a decrease of 21%.</p></reply>

In developing the Terms of Reference due regard has been given to the emphasis on &ldquo;Mother and Baby Homes&rdquo; in the motion approved by D&aacute;il Eireann on the 11th June 2014 and the investigation will examine a wide agenda of matters in relation to these homes.  I believe the Terms of Reference reflect the range of matters that we were asked to consider by this House, and by those most centrally affected by the issues, and are a fair and balanced response to the many requests for related issues to be included.  In particular, the investigation will thoroughly examine the experience of the many mothers and children who were resident in a Mother and Baby Home over the period 1922-1998.</p>  <p>  Clear criteria have been used to define and identify Mother and Baby Homes for the purposes of this investigation.  These include having the main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante- and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children, including both board and lodgings; and an ethos which those running the institutions considered to promote a regime of work, training or education as part of an overall approach to either rehabilitating single mothers, or to give them training for living independently.  On the basis of the available information it would not be appropriate to consider the types institutions raised by the Deputy as Mother and Baby Homes, as they did not provide this specific range of services.  However, the Terms of Reference ask the Commission to examine the extent to which institutions which had a clear relationship with Mother and Baby Homes were part of the entry or exit pathways for single mothers and children into or leaving these Homes.  It is certainly open to the Commission to give consideration to the types of institutions raised by the Deputy in this context.  The issues to be examined by the social history module also explicitly cite the Magdalen Laundries in this regard.</p>  <p>  The proposed arrangements also ensure that the Commission has sufficient opportunity to bring any additional matter which it considers may warrant investigation to my attention.</p></reply>

The gross income limits up to that date were &euro;600 per week for a single person and at &euro;1,200 per week for a couple.<br/><br/>The over 70s gross income limit for a single person was reduced proportionately less than the gross income limit for a couple under the Budgetary change as the Government recognises that the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together and <font color="#212100">that expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in the household</font>. This is recognised, inter alia, through the provision of the Living Alone Increase and differential income limits for medical cards for persons aged under 70 years between individuals and couples. There are no proposals to change these gross income limits. <br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs.  This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70s gross income thresholds.  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<br/><br/>The Government has, in addition, approved the drafting of a Bill to provide a GP service without fees for all persons aged 70 years and over. Drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage and the expectation is that the Bill will be published shortly.</p></reply>

As well as contributing to high levels of ED admissions, these factors can present difficulties in discharging such patients to home or other appropriate care settings.  In addition, changes in service provision (e.g. cancer services) have increased the general patient attendance at Beaumont, placing additional pressures on bed capacity.</p>  <p>  All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  Beaumont Hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve the patient pathway both through the ED and the hospital, in addition to working closely with the community.  All available bed capacity is open and off-site capacity is also being utilised. Elective surgeries (with the exception of cancer cases) have been cancelled for this week and this option is being kept under constant review.  With regard to nursing shortages, Beaumont Hospital is  working with other major hospitals to initiate an overseas recruitment campaign to help meet their needs for nursing staff.  The HSE would encourage patients to contact their GPs in the first instance where they can be directed appropriately to services such as rapid access clinics, day hospital services for older people and acute medical assessment units, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided additional funding of  &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges.  This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The Minister convened the Emergency Department Taskforce to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  Following an initial meeting in December, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of January to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p></reply>

Any GP who holds a GMS contract is eligible to apply for a vacant GMS panel.  Such panels are filled through open competition and interview following advertisements in national and medical newspapers.  There is no restriction on the HSE placing advertisements for such competitions.<br/><br/>The HSE is currently engaged in a medical workforce planning project, which will include workforce planning for GPs.  The Medical Workforce Planning Project underway within the HSE's National Doctor Training and Planning Unit is on target to develop a medical workforce planning system by June 2015.  The system will be based on a statistical model of supply and demand which will be informed by expert stakeholders, population and medical workforce data across all medical specialties.  Both entrants into and exits from the workforce will be accounted for.  Furthermore, a measure of patient need and the demand for medical specialist services will be determined and included in the statistical model.  Medical workforce planning for General Practice is included in this work and will be prioritised in the development of workforce projections based on both the supply of GPs and the demand for GP services over the next 20 years.</p></reply>

I have raised my concerns in relation to this matter with the diplomat concerned and his authorities and I hope that it will be possible to achieve a satisfactory resolution in these cases.  </p>  <p>  While I am not in a position to comment further on the matter in question, I would like to reiterate my strong commitment to the protection of domestic workers in Ireland.  My position on the rights of private domestic workers employed by diplomatic staff is clear: diplomatic staff who wish to employ private domestic workers are expected to respect Irish laws, including labour law and apply good employment practice.  I have been proactive in the promotion of best employment practices.   Last September, I introduced guidelines in relation to the employment of private domestic employees by diplomats in Ireland and I am committed to monitoring their implementation.  These guidelines, which set out clearly expectations regarding payment, employment records, health insurance and social security, can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I know that the majority of diplomatic staff already follow good practices in respect of employment practices, but I believe that the guidelines that I have introduced, combined with strong implementation, will help to prevent possible exploitation of domestic workers in diplomatic households and to assist victims.  The Department works closely with other Government Departments, State Agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Migrant Rights Centre Ireland in relation to the implementation of the guidelines. </p>  <p>  The Department also continues to work closely with the authorities of the country of the diplomat concerned in the promotion of strong bilateral relations across a wide range of areas.</p></reply>

These include the very recent killing of a large number of civilians, estimated by Amnesty International to be as high as 2,000, in an attack by militants in the north-eastern state of Borno.  I am utterly appalled by reports of the use of innocent young children to carry primed explosives.  I have also previously condemned  the abduction of more than 200 young girls from a school in the Nigerian town of Chibok last April. </p>  <p>  Nigeria was the subject of a Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in October 2013.  During that process, Ireland raised a number of issues including the ongoing atrocities being committed by Boko Haram and its total disregard for the human rights of the people affected.   </p>  <p>  The EU remains committed to providing a comprehensive range of political, development and humanitarian supports to Nigeria and its people in tackling the terrorist threat and in ensuring the sound development of the country.  At the fifth Nigeria-EU Ministerial Dialogue held in Abuja on 27th   November 2014, both the EU and Nigeria expressed concern that the violence of Boko Haram was becoming deep-rooted and was also affecting the wider region, including through refugee movements across borders.  The EU emphasized the importance of a strong and human rights-compliant leadership in the fight against Boko Haram and in maintaining state control over the north-eastern states.  The parties noted the enhanced regional cooperation between Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</p>  <p>  The Nigerian Government has primary responsibility for addressing the security and human rights situation in their country.  The EU, as well as several individual EU Member States, and also the UN and the USA, continue to assist the Nigerian authorities in strengthening their ability to provide security and to combat terrorism.  Our Embassy in Abuja is working locally, in co-operation with the EU and other key partners, in support of these efforts.</p></reply>

However, Ministers will have a comprehensive discussion on the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Russia and it is likely that the situation in eastern Ukraine will be raised in the context of this debate.</p>  <p>  The crisis in Ukraine and its impact on relations with Russia remains a major foreign policy challenge for the EU.  Following Russia&rsquo;s illegal annexation of Crimea in March and clear evidence of its ongoing direct involvement in the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the response of the EU has been graduated.</p>  <p>  A three-phase approach was agreed by EU leaders at the March European Council, beginning with the suspension of talks on a proposed new EU-Russia agreement and on visa liberalization (Phase 1), moving to asset freezes and visa bans (Phase 2) and culminating at the end of July with a move to targeted sectoral sanctions (Phase 3).  The latter measures were further strengthened in early September following a serious deterioration of the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The sanctions were imposed in response to Russia&rsquo;s actions in Ukraine and with the clear aim of encouraging a change in its behaviour towards its neighbour.  They are designed to be flexible and can be intensified or lessened depending on developments on the ground in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  The ceasefire agreements signed in Minsk last September provide the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict.  It is crucial, therefore, that all sides, including the Russian Federation, follow through on the commitments that they signed up to under these accords.  The lack of progress on key elements of the agreements in the intervening period is deeply disappointing.  Serious violations of the ceasefire in certain parts of eastern Ukraine occur on an almost daily basis and the current situation remains very fragile. </p>  <p>  I remain of the view that the restrictive measures against Russia, coupled with open dialogue and continued political and economic engagement with the various sides involved in the conflict, offer the best way of creating the conditions for a breakthrough.</p></reply>

In this regard, it did not enrol first year students for the 2014/15 school year.  I also understand that the school will remain open so that the current cohort of junior and senior cycle pupils can finish their programmes.  The school authority has informed my Department that it is assisting parents in securing alternative placements for the residue of pupils to ensure a smooth transition for these pupils to another school.<br/><br/>  The Deputy may wish to know that area concerned has 9 post-primary schools and there is spare capacity in a number of these schools at the moment.</p></reply>

The primary aim at the core of my Department's construction programme is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.  In the case of Cork, 43 school projects are listed to proceed to tender and construction over the duration of the programme.<br/><br/>  For the Deputy's convenience a list is attached containing details of all Cork major school building projects that have been completed in each of the past four years and the funding allocated in the case of each of these projects.As the Deputy will be aware, all publicly funded projects are subject to public procurement guidelines and a competitive tender process.

The primary purpose of the legislation is to re-unite the original account holders with their moneys, including all interest due. In addition, the legislation provides that disbursements from the fund may be made for charitable purposes or for purposes of community benefit.<br/><br/>Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of November 2014, the transfers to the Fund have totalled some &euro;779 million, which includes interest earned of approximately &euro;40.6 million. Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to around &euro;294.6 million. &euro;301 million of disbursements has been approved, with &euro;252 million already spent on projects designed to benefit the community over the same period. The net value of uncommitted funds is currently &euro;114 million.

The &euro;100 annual water conservation grant can be used in this regard to address issues such as leaking cisterns, dripping taps etc. Equally, households can use the grant towards other conservation measures such as the costs of water butts or installing dual flush toilets or rain water systems, de-sludging septic tanks or maintaining wells to ensure operating efficiency.</p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced, as it is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future.</p>  <p>  As the Department of Social Protection will administer the grant the process is streamlined and clearer for householders. It is also important that all households have an equal chance to reduce their water consumption in their principal private dwellings. This approach ha s a number of policy advantages as it makes water charges more affordable for lower income groups; conservation ensures a better use of our water resources and avoids unnecessary or premature expansion of water treatment plants; and it is environmentally sustainable and protects our water environment which is to the benefit of all citizens.</p></reply>

In total, my Department provided over &euro;77 million, between 2005 and 2010, to assist local authorities in improving access to public spaces, buildings and services for people with disabilities. Funding was allocated annually for purposes of Disability Services to local authorities, on the basis of priority areas identified by them in implementation plans.<br/><br/>The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) takes a central role in the implementation of the Disability Strategy in the local government sector and provides a range of advice and support to local authorities in that regard.<br/><br/>The Building Control Act 1990 and the Building Regulations 1997-2014 set down the minimum, legally enforceable standards that must be applied to the design and construction of buildings including in respect of access and use. The statutory requirements are set out in the relevant parts included under the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations 1997-2014. Technical guidance document Part M demonstrates how the statutory requirements in relation to access and use may be achieved in practice and aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.<br/><br/>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, the development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, <i>inter alia</i>, objectives for the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population. Accordingly, planning authorities include objectives in their development plans as appropriate to take significant and inclusive account of relevant statutory obligations including the building regulations.<br/><br/>Given the roles of the Building Control Act 1990, and Regulations made thereunder, and the Development Plan in specifying requirements and standards in relation to sustainable development generally, inclusive of access related matters, I am satisfied that the building control and planning processes fully support enhancement of access for all.</p></reply>

A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at, . <br/><br/>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports.  Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and a copy of the Quarter 3 2014 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above. <br/><br/>On 4 December 2014, I hosted a special Summit on Homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The Summit was attended by Oireachtas members, elected members and officials from the four Dublin Local Authorities, representatives from Government Departments, State Agencies and the NGO sector, and the Catholic and Church of Ireland Archbishops of Dublin.<br/><br/>A number of actions arising from the Summit were considered at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 8 December and were then formalised into an <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>which was noted by the Government at its meeting on 9 December 2014.  In addition to those actions which constitute an immediate response to the is sue of rough sleeping in Dublin, actions have been identified which tackle the more systemic issues, classified under the three categories of the 'housing-led' approach.  A copy of this action plan is available on my Department's website at the link provided above.  Progress in implementing this plan was considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform at its meeting on 17 December.<br/><br/>The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes.  In November 2014, I launched the Government's <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>.

Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, suppliers of drinking water, including Irish Water, are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water's compliance with these Regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier is required to investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive (HSE), to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken.  </p>  <p>  Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  I have no responsibility for, or role in relation to, the management, operation or maintenance of water services infrastructure.  The Water Services Act 2007 provides that where a property is connected to a public water or wastewater system the property owner is responsible for the maintenance and replacement of any water or wastewater pipes, connections or distribution systems which are connected within the boundary of the ir premises.  The introduction of a grants scheme for any purpose must be managed within current budgetary constraints and, insofar as the funds administered by my Department are concerned, there are no plans to introduce a scheme in relation to the replacement of lead pipes within housing estates.</p></reply>

Following this review, all towns with populations greater than 15,000 people were added to the smoky coal ban, which aligned the ban more closely with EPA air quality monitoring zones and provided for greater consistency in air quality standards for major urban areas.  In addition, the boundaries of most pre-existing ban areas were reviewed to take account of more recent urban development and census data.  In County Kildare, the review resulted in amendments to the boundaries of the ban areas in Naas, Celbridge and Leixlip as well as the addition of the town of Newbridge, with effect from May 2013.   No change was made to the status of Maynooth then, as the population of the town was below the threshold for compulsory inclusion and no representation was made at that time for the ban to be further extended elsewhere in the county. </p>  <p>  Kildare County Council subsequently voted in favour of a motion calling for the extension of the ban to Maynooth and wrote to inform my Department of this in June 2013. This motion was supported by the Health Service Executive. My Department requested that the local authority place a notice of this proposal in local newspapers to allow for a period of consultation.  A notice was subsequently placed by the local authority and n o objections were received.   My Department then agreed to address this proposal as part of the next up date to the Principal Regulations made under the Air Pollution Act.       </p>  <p>  Having considered this proposal, my Department considers that there is merit in extending the clean air benefits of the ban to the town of Maynooth, given its size, fast-growing population and close proximity to the existing specified ban area of Celbridge-Leixlip. Accordingly, I intend to finalise, shortly,   regulations that will extend the ban area of Celbridge&ndash;Leixlip to include the Electoral Division of Maynooth with effect from 1 June 2015. This lead-in period will allow time for businesses and households to change over to smokeless fuel as well as for the local authority to raise awareness of the main provisions of the ban at local level in advance of its introduction.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. The map can be accessed at . The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State. <br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises / home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands in every county in Ireland.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. This is a requirement under EU state aid rules. A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) towards the end of 2015. In this regard the Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016. <br/><br/>This is a large and complex project and we need to get it right. Our aim is to deliver high-quality, high speed broadband infrastructure that will stand the test of time. This requires careful planning. This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-15a.677.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500074#WRZ01500"><p>Ireland has a very clear strategy in respect of the Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration sector, key elements of which are: to seek to maximise the benefits to the people of Ireland from its indigenous natural resources; to provide opportunities and encourage private industry to take the risk associated with investing in exploration; to take initiatives to deepen knowledge of the potential of Ireland's offshore, in particular through supporting key research projects; and to seek to have a robust regulatory regime in place to ensure that activities are carried out in a safe manner that does not harm the environment.   Recent years have seen an increase in interest in the potential of the Irish Offshore as evidenced by:</p>  <p>  - Today, Ireland has the highest number of exploration authorisations in place, since exploration began in our offshore four decades ago; and</p>  <p>  - The level of seismic acquisition has risen significantly with more 2D and 3D seismic acquired in the period 2013 to 2014 than in the preceding ten years combined.</p>  <p>  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland's offshore basins. Nevertheless, the oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells being drilled from the current levels of 1 or less wells per year.</p>  <p>  Ireland competes for exploration investment and there have been significant changes in petroleum markets over the past year, however it is anticipated that drilling levels will increase from a low base over the next two to five years, as drilling commitments now in place are delivered and as new drilling commitments are entered into following on from decisions made by companies currently investing in seismic acquisition.</p>  <p>  With regard to production, it is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the Corrib gas field pipeline will shortly be completed, with first gas anticipated in mid-2015. With successful exploration and development, Ireland has potential to benefit from its natural resources of oil and gas in terms of taxation of profits, strengthened energy security of supply and from the economic activity generated through the construction and production phases of any new development. I understand that more than 1,000 jobs have been generated over the past five years in respect of the development of the Corrib field.</p>  <p>  What we are witnessing in our offshore is positive and there is a clear forward momentum. The Government&rsquo;s intention is that momentum should be maintained in 2015.</p>  <p>  In that regard my Department will progress a broad range of initiatives during 2015 including:</p>  <p>  - Promotion of the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round which closes in September 2015 and includes all of Ireland&rsquo;s major Atlantic basins. </p>  <p>  - Completion of Irish Offshore Strategic Environmental Assessment (IOSEA) 5 encompassing the Atlantic Margin basins offshore west of Ireland together with the Fastnet, Celtic Sea and Kish Basins offshore south and east of Ireland. The purpose of IOSEA 5 will be to assess any potential impacts on the marine environment associated with activities conducted under petroleum exploration and production authorisations, including any new authorisations awarded under the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round; and</p>  <p>  - Working with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to give operational effect in the Finance Bill 2015 to revised oil and gas fiscal arrangements arising out of the recommendations of the Wood Mackenzie Report published in June 2014.</p></reply>

The recommendation arose principally because of the non-utilisation of the cliff service balanced against the safety considerations of delivering a highly technical and intrinsically hazardous activity.</p>  <p>  The Coast Guard, having monitored the demand for cliff rescue services has noted that the level of call outs responded to by Bunbeg CGU does not justify the maintenance of a cliff rescue service. Since the establishment of a cliff rescue service in the late 90's, the team has not been called upon to intervene in any lifesaving cliff recovery incident. For a CGU to engage in a high risk activity that demands a high level of resources in terms of training time, equipment and supervision, the benefits must clearly outweigh the risks. The maintenance of a cliff rescue team has been deprioritised, thus enabling the unit to concentrate on its boat rescue and shoreline search operations, which are regularly called into action. The investment which my Department has made in the Coast Guard rescue helicopter services has mitigated some of the demands for cliff rescue services.</p>  <p>  The Bunbeg CGU will continue to be a well-resourced team and I have recently provided a new off-road vehicle to support its roles. Enhancement of boat rescue services and shoreline search by the unit will continue to be the priority based on need and risk.</p></reply>

The 1926 Census is the next full set of Census records, after the 1911 returns, which is available to the State. However, current legislative provisions, as contained in the Statistics Act 1993, require that census data must be withheld for 100 years. Accordingly, it is not possible at this time to release the 1926 Census returns before the statutory period has elapsed in 2026. If the records were to be released before the expiry of 100 years, a<font color="#004080"> </font>major<font color="#004080"> </font>change in legislation and policy would be required to allow for the early release.  This is not currently being proposed. <br/><br/>A 1926 Census Working Group has been formed, comprising officials from my own Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has examined this complex project and has assessed the significant resources - in terms of additional financial, staff and infrastructural resources - that will need to be in place to move the project forward to completion. I can say that, following discussions within the Working Group, I am of the opinion that the extensive preparatory work required to prepare the 1926 Census database for processing, and eventual digitisation to facilitate the release of the data into the public domain, should continue. It must be recognised, however, that, in light of the level of additional resources that will be necessary, and of the current engagement by the National Archives on a number of other important projects, including some that form a key part of the programme for the Decade of Commemorations, it will be necessary to work over time towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the 1926 Census project.</p></reply>
