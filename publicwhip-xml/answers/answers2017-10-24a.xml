    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-24a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102400059#WRA00600"><p>I am aware that the livestock marts sector has encountered difficulties in relation to insurance matters, as this was the subject of a Topical Issue discussion in this House in July, and in addition, it has arisen as an issue in the course of the second phase work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) on employer and public liability insurance.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that the major problem facing marts is access to cover, as there are a very limited number of companies willing to provide such insurance.  Insurance Ireland has advised that this is because livestock marts have a significant exposure to injuries to employees and members of the public.  Consequently premiums are reflective of the hazardous nature of this sector as well as its overall claims experience.  However they have indicated that they are not aware of any recent major increases in the cost insurance for agricultural mart owners.  </p>  <p>  In order to try and mitigate the hazardous nature of the marts environment, Insurance Ireland has also advised that insurers have developed active risk management programmes to try to reduce the level of accidents and injuries.  In addition, I understand that insurers have been working with marts with a view to implementing improvements in management practices and facilities to reduce claims as this is the key area to manage claim costs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that in my role as Minister for Finance I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an acceptance of the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I acknowledge that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping stabilise the insurance market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance, and that explains why the CIWG is currently considering the issue of employer and public liability cover including its impact on the agri-sector.</p></reply>

As part of this update, the Bank released details of their engagement with lenders thus far and the enforcement actions the Bank has so far taken.  However, as the Taoiseach noted last Wednesday during Leaders' Questions, the Government is not satisfied with the progress lenders have made to date and believes that impacted customers should by this time have had their tracker mortgages restored and where appropriate have received redress and compensation.</p>  <p>  I have just concluded my meetings with the CEOs of Bank of Ireland, AIB, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank and KBC to discuss the Tracker Mortgage Examination and I have made it clear that the Government is not satisfied with the progress lenders have made to date.  All relevant mortgage lenders need to bring the Central Bank examination to a conclusion without any further delay, and to do so to the satisfaction of the Central Bank and more particularly to the satisfaction of their impacted customers.  The Government is of the view that impacted tracker mortgage borrowers have been treated disgracefully by mortgage lenders, and that many borrowers have incurred considerable losses and in some cases even more significant harm.  We should be clear that it was the mortgage lenders that caused this harm to their customers and that the primary responsibility for rectifying the problem rests with them.  The time has now arrived for the banks to finally act in the best interest of their impacted mortgage customers.  The Government fully supports the Central Bank it its work to bring this very important industry wide examination to the earliest possible conclusion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-24a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102400059#WRA01400"><p>The impact of the Budget on poverty levels is assessed using the ESRI SWITCH model, which is a tax-benefit micro-simulation model used by Government Departments, including my own, to assess the distributional impact of the Budget. </p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) will produce and publish a Social Impact Assessment of Budget 2018 in the coming weeks on their website.  This will use the SWITCH model to consider the impact of the Budget on poverty levels, in particular how the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate changes as a result of the social welfare and tax measures contained in Budget 2018.  My Departments provide inputs to DEASP when they are preparing the Social Impact Assessment.  However, preliminary analysis carried out by my Departments indicates that, in overall terms, as a result of Budget 2018, households experience an average increase in the order of 1% in weekly disposable income. Gains are highest for the first (lowest income) quintile at over 2 per cent and lowest for the fifth (highest income) quintile at below 1 per cent, pointing to a progressive Budget package.  Notwithstanding the usefulness of SWITCH in providing results which are representative of the full population of households in Ireland, it has a number of notable shortcomings. It does not, for example, model the impact of expenditure on public services such as health or education, which has an important impact on alleviating poverty.</p>  <p>  As a tax-benefit model, however, SWITCH does show the impact of tax and social welfare changes announced in the Budget.  I note that Ireland has the second most progressive income tax system in the OECD, meaning that those on higher incomes pay proportionally more in tax than those on lower incomes.  By definition, this implies that any tax reduction will benefit those who earn most. The SWITCH model results for the Budget tax package reflect this fact; it is a consequence of having such a progressive tax system in the first place. </p>  <p>  The CSO produces statistics on poverty using the Survey of Income and Living Standards (SILC). The survey provides data on household income, poverty and deprivation rates, and income inequality.  The latest SILC data relate to 2015 and indicate that the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate in Ireland was 16.9%, below the EU28-average.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate represents the percentage of the population in households where equivalised disposable income per person is less than 60% of the median. </p>  <p>  If all social transfers were excluded from income, the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate would have been 46.3% in 2015, according to the same survey.  I note that the difference between two rates points to the effective role of the overall social welfare system in combatting poverty.</p>  <p>  This is also reflected in the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s Gini co-efficient for disposable income is below the OECD-average (2014 is the latest year for which data are available).  The Gini co-efficient is the most common measure of income inequality and the lower it is the lower the level of income inequality.  Indeed, Ireland&rsquo;s tax and welfare system lead to the largest absolute reduction in income inequality in the OECD.</p>  <p>  In summary, the discretionary measures announced in Budget 2018 will result in income gains, with the greatest impact for households on the lowest incomes.  I look forward to seeing DEASP&rsquo;s assessment as to its impact on poverty.  I reiterate that the tax and social welfare system overall continue to reduce income inequality and reduce poverty in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-24a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102400059#WRA01700"><p>The first avenue of complaint for any customer aggrieved by an action of a regulated financial service provider is to complain to the entity concerned.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code provides that &ldquo;A regulated entity must have written procedures in place for the effective handling of errors which affect consumers.&rdquo;  The Code also specifies the procedures to be followed in the event of a complaint.</p>  <p>  When the complaint is finalised, the Code requires that the consumer be informed that they can refer the matter to the Financial Service Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  If the consumer is not satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, I would strongly advise them to pursue a complaint with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s website has a simple on-line complaint form. Of course, it will also accept complaints in writing. </p>  <p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman has informed me that he tries, in the first instance, to resolve complaints in an informal manner by mediation through its dedicated Dispute Resolution Service.  Where disputes are not resolved through mediation the FSO will investigate and adjudicate the complaint.  The FSO has a wide range of powers and can direct compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and direct rectification which could, for example, include redress where a borrower has been charged the incorrect interest rate. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the time limit for long term financial services was recently extended and consumers are now able to submit complaints within three years of becoming aware of the reason for their grievance.  The legislation also allows a consumer whose complaint was previously refused as outside time limits to submit a complaint. </p>  <p>  It is my role as Minister for Finance to ensure that an appropriate framework is in place to allow consumers a simple and effective route to resolve complaints and I consider that such a framework is in place.  The Financial Service Ombudsman provides a reasonably quick means of resolving complaints at no cost to the consumer.  I am, aware of the discussions at the Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach Committee and will be examining whether any further changes to the framework are required. </p>  <p>  The Government believes the behaviour of the banks in regard to removing people from tracker mortgages was unacceptable.  I have met or will meet the CEOs of the main banks, Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank, PTSB and KBC, this week and will be making a statement when these meetings have concluded.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-24a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102400059#WRA02000"><p>As at end-June 2017, the Central Bank figures state that 120,398 outstanding (PDH) mortgage accounts were restructured; 15,371 restructures (12.8%) were term extensions only, without any other restructure arrangement in place.  In accounts where restructures include term extension as a part of the modification (i.e. multiple restructure types), 30,029 outstanding accounts incorporated a term extension as at end-June 2017.</p>  <p>In relation to the number of mortgage holders that have entered into a restructuring arrangement that included lengthening the term of the loan to deal with mortgage debt in the past five years  , the Central Bank have informed me that 373,886 Principal Dwelling Houses (PDH) mortgage accounts entered restructuring arrangements over the past 5 years (Q3 2012 - Q2 2017).</p>  <p>The Central Bank of Ireland Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics   show that during this period, 35,588 account restructures were agreed incorporating a term extension.  This restructure total includes both accounts in arrears, and accounts where no arrears apply.  These include first time restructures, multi-restructure arrangements and further modifications of existing restructure. In some cases, term extension is part of a wider modification, involving multiple restructure types. </p>  <p>  This 373,886 PDH figure   represents accounts &lsquo;added&rsquo; to the restructure category. It includes both accounts in arrears, and accounts where no arrears apply and includes first time restructures and further modifications of existing restructure over the past 5 years. An addition could represent a new restructure arrangement for that account, and could be a second, third or subsequent restructure arrangement for a particular account.  The figure excludes double counting of accounts that have multiple restructure arrangements in a given quarter, these accounts are counted once in a given quarter.  However, an account may be included multiple times if there were subsequent restructure arrangement for a particular account over the 5 year period.</p>  <p>  Further breakdowns are not available from the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  Where a borrower actively engages with their lender it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found helping the borrower to stay in their family home.  I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not done so, to contact their lender or MABS for an independent assessment of their situation and advice on options.</p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to recent progress made by the Government in assisting those in mortgage arrears.  The Abhaile service helps borrowers in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, if possible, in their own homes.  This is assisting borrowers, particularly those in longer term arrears. A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in arrears and their lender to find the best solution for them.  </p>  <p>  Borrowers can get free advice from an expert financial adviser who can help them to work through their financial situation and where possible help them to remain in their home.  An Expert adviser could be from MABS or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant.</p>  <p>  Borrowers may also need legal advice and under Abhaile they can have a free meeting with a solicitor.</p>  <p>  If called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court.  A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.</p>  <p>  A Helpline is available Monday to Friday and a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 MABS locations nationwide.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-24a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102400059#WRA02300"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that all insurers operating in the Irish market are regulated under conduct of business rules by the Central Bank.  Consequently they are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code which sets out the rights of consumers including how claims are handled. </p><p>In relation to the bringing to the attention of policyholders their rights in relation to insurance claims arising from Storm Ophelia, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has updated its website accordingly and the information can be found at: <i>https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/2017/10/18/can-i-make-insurance-claim-storm-ophelia/.  </i></p><p>In addition, my officials have been in touch with Insurance Ireland  about this matter.  In response they have indicated that business insurance policies will provide cover for storm damage to premises and stock.  Such policies will also cover for business interruption which is triggered when there has been storm damage to the premises.  They have advised however that it is important for businesses to contact their insurance company or broker after the event and guidance will be provided on making a claim.  </p><p>With regard to household buildings and contents insurance, Insurance Ireland has also advised that policies will cover damage caused by storms.  Insurers will usually pay for the cost of temporary repairs, so policyholders should keep receipts.  Insurers will also usually pay for the cost of alternative accommodation, if the home becomes uninhabitable.  However, householders should check the full extent of their policies and contact their insurer or broker for further information. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases as  these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.  However, my own view is that it is too early yet to determine what the impact of storm Ophelia will have on future insurance premiums, so I will be indicating to insurers that they should be careful in rushing to judgement on the need for future price increases.</p></reply>

This section requires the NTMA to ascertain, to its satisfaction, that the employee has no material conflict of interest, whether actual or potential, in respect of his or her proposed assignment to NAMA.</p>  <p>  In addition, NAMA officers are subject to a number of additional obligations regarding disclosure of interests.  They are holders of designated positions of employment for the purposes of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, which obligates them to furnish an annual statement of interests and a statement of material interests.</p>  <p>  Further obligations on NAMA staff are outlined in the &lsquo;Code of Practice-Conduct of Officers of NAMA&rsquo;, which is updated and submitted to me for approval on an annual basis.  The Code is available on the NAMA website and sets out the best practice standards of principles and practice in relation to confidentiality and conflicts of interest.  The Code underscores NAMA&rsquo;s commitment to the highest standards of conduct and has been prepared to assist NAMA staff in understanding their duties, rights and obligations.  In particular I would refer the Deputy to Part II of the Code which deals with Conflicts of Interest and references obligations which are additional to NAMA officers&rsquo; statutory obligations. </p>  <p>  NAMA recruits staff with a diverse range of experience and expertise and with backgrounds in property, banking, investment, law, planning and corporate finance, among other disciplines.  This expertise has been, and continues to be, crucial in ensuring that NAMA is in a position to achieve its stated objective under Section 10 of the NAMA Act 2009, which is to achieve the best financial return for the State.</p>  <p>  I am advised that it is not possible to provide the Deputy with information on the number of current and former NAMA officers who were previously employed in investment funds and property companies as this would require the NTMA to manually extract the information from more than 600 curricula vitae of current and former staff members.  It is not possible to identify the specific funds and companies for the same reason.  I am also advised that release of such information could lead to the identification of specific individuals and that this could have Data Protection implications.</p></reply>

My officials have requested Taxback.com to share any underlying survey document and results.  </p><p>The available information indicates that the survey was based on a sample of 800 people who were customers of Taxback.com.  The question these customers were asked was &ldquo;Would you agree with the implementation of a wealth tax?&rdquo; Based on the available options that respondents could choose from in answering the question, Taxback.com customers appear to agree with a wealth tax under certain circumstances. </p><p>At the outset, it is important to understand where Ireland stands in relation to the distribution of wealth. In 2013, the Central Statistics Office conducted the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) providing for the first comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland.  The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition.  The data indicate that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini Coefficient, is lower than the euro area average. </p><p>My officials examine all issues related to taxation, including wealth taxation, on an on-going basis.  For instance during 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS.  The research paper, &ldquo;Scenarios and Distributional Implications of a Household Wealth Tax in Ireland&rdquo; is available on the ESRI website</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The paper presented results on the composition of net wealth (i.e. assets less liabilities) across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland.  A number of wealth tax scenarios, including regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios, were then applied to the Irish data. In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected were outlined.</p><p>It should be noted that Ireland already taxes wealth in a variety of ways, such as our Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) which are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset in the case of CGT, or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance, in the case of CAT. </p><p>Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 39%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  </p><p>The Local Property Tax, which was introduced in 2013, is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  </p><p>My Department will monitor and consider any additional information and data that comes to light and will continue to examine potential taxation sources.  I do not, however, have any plans to introduce tax measures along the lines indicated in the survey responses referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The central purpose of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high-value added R&amp;amp;D activity in Ireland, thereby supporting jobs and investment here. Reflecting these considerations, the Government&rsquo;s Innovation 2020 Strategy aims to achieve the EU 2020 target of increasing overall (i.e. public and private) R&amp;amp;D expenditure in Ireland to 2.5 per cent of GNP by 2020. </p><p>The cost of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit in 2015, which is the latest figure available, was &euro;708 million. </p><p>A review of the R&amp;amp;D credit was carried out ahead of Budget 2017, and it concluded that:</p><p>- The R&amp;amp;D tax credit is responsible for 60% of the R&amp;amp;D being conducted.  This is considered to be a reasonable level of additionality.</p><p>- The bang for buck ratio is estimated to be 2.4 (i.e. for every one euro in foregone tax revenue, &euro;2.40 in additional R&amp;amp;D is being conducted).  This is also considered a reasonable result. </p><p>Overall, the paper&rsquo;s findings suggest that the rationale for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is not in question.  Firms clearly respond to it by increasing their R&amp;amp;D.</p><p>It important to note the changes that have occurred in the R&amp;amp;D tax credit since its inception, which have contributed to the increased cost of the tax credit.  In particular, the removal of the base year threshold and the introduction of the refundable element of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit have contributed to an increased cost.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2015, the base year threshold of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit was phased out and ultimately removed.  This entailed that all relevant expenditure could qualify for the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit.  Previously, qualifying R&amp;amp;D was only that in excess of the expenditure incurred in 2003.  The concept of the base year threshold ignored the fact that the availability of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit can be an important factor in deciding whether to undertake a new project or not.  It is important to recognise that the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is not just important for stimulating additional R&amp;amp;D investment, but also for maintaining the R&amp;amp;D operations currently undertaken in the State.  It was anticipated that this change would lead to an increase in the cost of the tax credit.</p><p>My officials and I are conscious of the need for regularly evaluating the R&amp;amp;D tax credit.  However, it is important to recognise that while this is a generous tax credit, it is one of the few corporation tax credits that we have in Ireland, when compared with other jurisdictions.  My officials and I are mindful of the need to constantly monitor the cost of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit and will continue to do so in line with the Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.</p></reply>

This work is being done in parallel with the implementation of the motor report.  The Working Group is chaired by Minister of State D'Arcy.</p><p>As part of its review, the Working Group has engaged in an extensive consultation process with a range of stakeholders including the Hotels Federation of Ireland, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners' Association, the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association, Chambers Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and a number of insurers and brokers who cover this type of risk.

Revenue&rsquo;s collection of receipts is essential to the Exchequer and the funding of public services for the State.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 includes an additional &euro;100 million to be raised from three compliance measures, in relation to employer PAYE compliance (&euro;50 million), eCommerce/online business compliance (&euro;30 million) and tax avoidance and base erosion capacity (&euro;20 million).  To support delivery of these measures, Revenue has been allocated an additional &euro;7m for extra staffing and ICT enhancements in the estimates for 2018.  These extra resources will enable Revenue to target additional compliance activities in the areas specified and deliver the &euro;100 million expected from increased audit and intervention yield as well as changes in taxpayer behaviour prompted by Revenue&rsquo;s actions.  This is also in line with the recent Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code which recommended that, to reduce uncertainty and ensure that Ireland protects its corporation tax base, Ireland should ensure an adequately resourced Competent Authority.</p>  <p>  The additional funding allocation and expected yield estimates are based on analysis of historical data recording the compliance receipts generated by Revenue in recent years.  They are also informed by work currently underway in these areas as part of Revenue&rsquo;s national compliance imperatives, which indicate the yield that could be expected in 2018 from increasing resources in these areas.</p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2014 noted that Revenue staffing levels had reduced by 13% since 2008 and that by increasing resources additional revenue yield could be achieved.  In recognition of this, the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Budgets provided for an increase of 266 (126, 50 and 90 respectively) in additional staffing resources for Revenue to deal with a wide variety of requirements across audit and compliance functions, debt management functions, LPT, international tax and Brexit.  I have again provided for additional staffing in Revenue in this year&rsquo;s Budget.</p>  <p>  Revenue received an additional funding allocation of &euro;3 million in 2016 to increase staff resources and assist in the delivery of the compliance measures announced in the 2016 Budget.  The compliance measures that were projected at the time of the Budget (October 2015) were expected to yield an additional &euro;75 million to the Exchequer in 2016.  Revenue has recently published an analysis that confirms the estimates of yield for the measures have been delivered and the target of &euro;75 million exceeded. Conservative estimates show the measures in total yielded between &euro;120 million and &euro;150 million in the year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also specified a number of compliance measures: amendments in relation to Section 110 and fund changes (projected yield of &euro;50 million), tackling offshore tax evasion (&euro;30 million) and increased resources for Revenue to confront non-compliance (&euro;50 million). It is too early to accurately assess the impact of, or collection under, these headings for 2017.  This will not be possible until after the end of the year.  However, the target will be exceeded as &euro;79 million was collected from disclosures in relation to offshore assets. Revenue will undertake detailed analysis of the Budget 2017 measures when data are available.</p></reply>

Lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of the borrower's primary residence after it follows a number of steps.  The steps include:</p>  <p>  - making every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative restructure arrangement (ARA) with the borrower;</p>  <p>  - time bound requirements to inform the borrower the regulated entity is not willing to offer an ARA and of his/her options;</p>  <p>  - time bound requirements to inform a borrower, who is not willing to enter into an ARA, of his/her options; and</p>  <p>  - a decision to classify the borrower as non-cooperating. </p>  <p>  Lenders must ensure that the case of each borrower is individually assessed on its merits to ensure fairness.  The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework sets out the steps which lenders must follow.  A lender must carry out an affordability assessment by examining each case on its own merits and must base its assessment of the borrower's full circumstances including their ability to repay as determined by up to date information on a Standard Financial Statement (SFS).  A lender must explore all options for alternative repayment arrangements (that they offer) in order to offer the most viable option to each borrower.  The Code also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.  The lender is also obliged to carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that there is a broad range of available restructures offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities and there is strong evidence that both banks and non-banks look to exhaust available restructure options before moving to the legal process. </p>  <p>  I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Mortgage Arrears and Restructures Data released by the Central Bank on 12 September, which shows that to end-Q2 2017, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last sixteen consecutive quarters.  120,398 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured, of which 87% were reported to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.  A total of 340 Primary Dwelling Home properties were taken into possession during Q2 2017, down from 370 properties in Q1 2017.  Of the properties taken into possession during the quarter, 109 were repossessed on foot of a Court Order, while the remaining 231 were voluntarily surrendered or abandoned.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the Abhaile mortgage arrears resolution service, established to ensure that those either in mortgage arrears or at risk of going into mortgage arrears on their primary residence are able to access State-funded professional legal or financial advice on their resolution options.  </p>  <p>  The aim of Abhaile is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The service is proving very successful in assisting distressed borrowers, particularly those in longer term mortgage arrears. A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in mortgage arrears and their lender to find the best solution for their situation.  </p>  <p>  If those in mortgage arrears need financial advice, they can get a free face to face meeting with an expert financial adviser.  The adviser can help them to work through their financial situation and explain the options available to them to help deal with their home mortgage arrears.  The expert adviser could be a MABS Money Adviser, a MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears adviser, a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant.</p>  <p>  Distressed borrowers may also need legal advice on issues related to their mortgage arrears.  Under Abhaile they can have a free face-to-face meeting with a solicitor, who will explain their legal situation and advise them how best to resolve it.</p>  <p>  If they are called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court.  The Duty Solicitor may be able to speak for them in court and explain the proceedings to them.</p>  <p>  A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.</p>  <p>  A Helpline is also available Monday to Friday, and a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 locations nationwide.</p>  <p>  It is worth mentioning as has been done here many times before that where a borrower actively engages with their lender it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be to try to assist the borrower to remain in their family home.

However, without this extension of MIR provided for in Budget 2018, each remaining relief holder would have faced a &lsquo;cliff&rsquo; where the relief would have ceased entirely in January 2018.  The three year extension has been put in place in order to alleviate the potential financial difficulties of this &lsquo;cliff&rsquo;, and to give the relief holders a transition period to adjust to the cessation of the relief on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  As the Revenue Commissioners would not have information on whether mortgages are in arrears or if relief holders are in negative equity, there is no data available to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to the number of such individuals who are in receipt of MIR. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may be aware that data released in September by the Central Bank on Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics for Quarter 2 of 2017 provided further evidence that progress is being made in addressing mortgage arrears.  The number of Private Dwelling House mortgage accounts in arrears continued to fall in Q2 2017, marking the 16th consecutive quarterly decline.  A total of 73,706 (10%) of accounts were in arrears at end-Q2, a decline of 3.6% relative to Q1 and a decline of 48% since Q2 of 2013.</p>  <p>  My decision in Budget 2018 to extend MIR on a tapered basis for three years balances the competing objectives of allowing relief holders a transition period to adjust to the withdrawal of relief, while also considering the fairness to mortgage holders who have never held a relief on their mortgage interest, who may also face similar financial challenges in meeting mortgage repayments.</p></reply>

However, the base for USC does not include payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including the State pension.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in 2011 and the issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public service who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.  In retirement therefore they receive an occupational pension only, and do not receive a separate State Pension unless as a result of PRSI contributions made in another employment during their working life.</p>  <p>  It was decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as an exemption would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it could involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefitting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.  However, as a result of the review of the USC, in Budget 2012 the entry threshold to USC was increased from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum, and the threshold was subsequently increased further in Budgets 2015 and 2016, to the current threshold of &euro;13,000.  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to continue the process of reducing the personal tax burden, with a particular focus on low and middle-income earners, subject to having the required fiscal space.  Budget 2018 has continued the progress made in the three previous Budgets in reducing rates of USC at lower income levels.  The combined effect of Budgets 2015 to 2018 will see a reduction in the three lowest rates of USC from 2%, 4% and 7% to 0.5%, 2% and 4.75% respectively. </p>  <p>  I have also stated on a number of occasions that my long term view of the USC is to see its amalgamation with the existing PRSI system.  This is a complex undertaking that will take time to plan and implement, and will require further consideration of all the distinct features of the USC and PRSI systems, including the taxation of pre-95 public servants.  Over the next year, my officials will be working with their counterparts in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to plan, over the coming year, the process of amalgamating USC and PRSI over the medium term.  The amalgamation of these charges will help to ensure that vital public services will be well-funded into the future, as well as supporting the improvement of our social insurance system, for the benefit of all our citizens.</p></reply>

The Government remains committed to progressing payments of the 65% portion of settled claims to third party Setanta claimants as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.</p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced. Under the current legislation payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants. </p>  <p>  The Liquidator has informed my Department that, as of 30 September 2017, there are 1,576 active claims, of which 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limits.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and are subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  The Liquidator is currently working on settled claims and preparing them for inclusion in the next application to the High Court, expected to be made in February 2018.</p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process.  An actuarial report, commissioned by the liquidator, estimates the claims reserves at 30 June 2017 at between &euro;105.9 million and &euro;112.9 million.  This is an increase from the first report in 2014, which estimated the claims reserves at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.</p>  <p>  A consequence of this is that based on this actuarial report, the liquidator now estimates that he will not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation, rather than the not more than 30% of claims figure previously indicated. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the issue referred to by the Deputy regarding the potential liability of Setanta policyholders to third party claimants in the event they do not receive full compensation.  On the question of a Government assurance for such policyholders, I cannot make any commitment on this matter as there is a legal concern that any Government intervention could undermine the priority status of claimants in the liquidation.  Consequently, the Department of Finance is seeking legal advice on the impact on the State's ability to recover from the liquidated company if it were to compensate third party claimants for the balance due to them.  Once the Department has clarified this legal concern, the Government will be in a better position to consider its response to this issue.</p></reply>

Lenders&rsquo; reviews are required to be conducted in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s framework for completion of the Examination (the &ldquo;Framework&rdquo;) issued in December 2015.  The Framework requires lenders to identify all impacted customers and to address customer detriment in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Principles for Redress.  Steps being taken by lenders to address customer detriment identified during the course of the Examination include putting customers on the correct interest rates (rate rectification) in order to stop the immediate harm caused to them and providing redress and compensation.  In that regard, the Principles for Redress provide that the compensation must be fair, clear and reflect the specific circumstances of each impacted customer.  </p>  <p>  Three lenders have commenced payment of redress and compensation to impacted customers.  The Central Bank expects that two of these lenders will have progressed the payment of redress and compensation to the majority of the customers they have identified as impacted by year-end.  The Central Bank continues to engage with and challenge the remaining lenders in respect of their redress and compensation proposals and expects that they will be in a position to commence providing redress and compensation by year-end.  To end September 2017, the aggregate figure for redress and compensation paid to customers arising from tracker issues is &euro;163 million.</p>  <p>  Arising from its tracker examination the Central Bank is pursuing enforcement action against lenders.  One enforcement investigation has concluded and a monetary penalty of &euro;4.5 million was imposed on Springboard Mortgages Ltd.  The Bank is currently pursuing enforcement investigations in relation to permanent tsb plc and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC.  Also two further enforcement investigations into other lenders are in train, and in its recent appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public, Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach the Central Bank indicated that further enforcement investigations can be anticipated.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also has statutory reporting obligations to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies where it suspects a criminal offence may have been committed by a supervised entity.  The Central Bank takes these obligations very seriously and complies with them on an on-going basis as appropriate.  However, decisions in relation to this would be solely a matter for the Central Bank and the independent criminal investigation and prosecution authorities.</p></reply>

Early repayment will require the agreement of the European lenders, the EFSF and the EFSM, and also the UK to waive the proportionate early repayment clauses in the respective loan agreements.  The process for securing these waivers is currently underway.</p>  <p>  It is important to be aware of the fact that it is not in Ireland&rsquo;s financial interests at this time to repay early the bilateral loan from the UK.  The UK loan is a fixed rate loan and the loan agreement contains a break clause which would be triggered in the event of early repayment.  The associated costs would offset any potential interest savings.  </p>  <p>  A table showing the maturity profile of Government bonds and EU/IMF Programme loans is updated monthly on the website of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). </p>  <p>  As at end-September 2017, there was close to &euro;49 billion of Irish Government bonds and EU-IMF Programme loans scheduled to mature over the four year period 2018-2021.</p>  <p>  There are &euro;6.9 billion of loans from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) with contractual maturity dates in 2018 and 2021.  However, the Deputy should be aware that owing to the maturity extensions granted in 2013, it is not expected that Ireland will have to refinance any EFSM loans before 2027.  Therefore these loans do not form part of the &euro;49 billion figure referred to above. </p>  <p>  The next repayment to the IMF is scheduled for 2021.  A total of 2.35 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) which is equivalent to approximately &euro;2.8 billion are due to be repaid to the IMF that year.  The remainder of the IMF loan is scheduled for repayment in 2022 and 2023. </p>  <p>  The Swedish and the Danish bilateral loans are scheduled to be repaid with &euro;250 million due in 2019, &euro;500 million in 2020 and &euro;250 million in 2021. </p>  <p>  The impact of the early repayments would therefore be to reduce the refinancing requirement over the three year period 2019 to 2021 by &euro;3.8 billion. </p></reply>

His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance subsequently proposed to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  I have stated consistently that my Department will consider issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline.  I can assure the Deputy that this work will be undertaken in good time and that the Government will be make its position clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT.  In that regard I consider it very important that the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT i.e., achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer terms, will inform our consideration of this matter.</p></reply>

The central purpose of the RandD tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high-value added RandD activity in Ireland, thereby supporting jobs and investment here.  </p>  <p>  In relation to losses, under existing loss relief provisions in the Taxes Acts, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for offset against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods.  Losses incurred in the carrying on of a trade are a normal fact of business life.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and of all other OECD countries.  It would be difficult to justify the taxation of business profits without also taking due account of business losses. The carry forward of unrelieved trading losses is a usual feature in other tax jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The effective tax rate of companies in 2015 was provisionally calculated by the Revenue Commissioners as 9.8%, representing a marginal increase on the 2014 rate of 9.7%.  In 2012 and 2013, the effective rate was 10.1%.  I would note that while these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of targeted measures, such as the RandD tax credit, available in Ireland which may lower the effective rate of corporation tax paid.</p>  <p>  The issue of tax avoidance has been at forefront of the international tax agenda in recent years.  The agreement of the OECD BEPS reports in late 2015 represented a landmark achievement in agreeing comprehensive reform of the international tax system.  Ireland has taken a number of steps towards implementing the BEPS recommendations and the Coffey Review sets out a roadmap for Ireland to follow in bringing certainty to the implementation of the remaining recommendations, beginning with the launch of a consultation process which is now underway. </p>  <p>  In keeping with our commitment to transparency, Ireland was among the first countries to implement Country by Country Reporting.  The first reports under the Country by Country Reporting requirement will be filed with Revenue in Ireland and worldwide this year.  These reports will be exchanged with all relevant countries to ensure tax authorities have a clear picture of the activities of large multinationals and can assess any risk that the correct tax has not been paid in the correct place.    </p>  <p>  Ireland was also among the first countries to sign the OECD BEPS multilateral instrument (MLI) in June this year.  This MLI will provide the mechanism for extensive changes to tax treaties globally.  It will ensure that tax treaties are updated to reflect a number of important OECD BEPS recommendations, including agreed standards on treaty shopping and dispute resolution.  Ireland will now seek to ratify the MLI, with the first steps in this process being taken in the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  </p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the OPW that the majority of CFRAM Plans are now with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its independent review of the environmental assessments.  Once this is completed and observations addressed, the final Plans will be submitted to me for approval in my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the CFRAM flood maps are community based maps and while they provide a useful resource for planning and emergency responses, they cannot be used for commercial purposes.  Instead, the insurance industry uses its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk to individual properties.</p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment on individual cases, I have been advised by the OPW that  (i) the maps relating to Abberley, Killiney, Co. Dublin have been finalised and will be published on the day of the launch of the CFRAM Programme and (ii) that information on the Tolka - East Wall Scheme, the Tolka - Hawthorne Terrace Scheme, and the Tolka - Richmond Road Scheme which are all located in Dublin 3, and built to the 1/100 year standard, has been shared with Insurance Ireland under the Memorandum of Understanding mentioned above.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

In the absence of the KEEP incentive, such gains would be subject to income tax, USC and PRSI at the time of exercise.  This can be a dis-incentive in the case of options for shares of small, unquoted companies, where no ready market may be available on which to sell some or all of the shares in order to fund the tax payable.</p>  <p>  It is not possible at this time to project the cost of the Key Employee Engagement Programme to 2023, as KEEP is a demand-led scheme and uptake will depend on the decisions made by qualifying SME companies with regard to the offering of share options to employees, and also on the growth in value of the employer company shares in the period between grant and exercise of the options.  However, having reference to the costs of a similar matured incentive in the UK, it has been estimated that the full-year cost of the Key Employee Engagement Programme will be in the region of &euro;10 million.  It is anticipated that it will take a number of years for this scale of cost to be reached.  There will be no immediate cost in 2018 as the share options must, with limited exceptions, be held for a minimum of twelve months before they can be exercised under this scheme.  It is also likely that employees may hold the KEEP share options for a number of years before exercise, as the options must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant, so a benefit will only arise to the employee if the shares increase in value from that date.</p>  <p>  KEEP share options have not been included as a specified relief for the purposes of the high income earners restriction.  That restriction is designed to limit the total amount of "specified reliefs" that a high income earner can use to reduce his or her tax liability in any one tax year such that an effective rate of income tax of approximately 30 per cent is payable.  In the case of KEEP share options, gains arising to the employee on the exercise of the options will receive relief from income tax at the point of exercise, but the gain will subsequently be subject to capital gains tax, currently at 33%, when the employee disposes of the shares.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the non-life insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) and the publication of its Motor Report in January 2017 were a direct response to this volatility.  The Report makes 33 recommendation to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs, whilst taking account of the requirement for the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  This stability aspect is important, as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation again where particular firms drive prices down to a level that is unsustainable and which ultimately results in insolvency.</p>  <p>  I believe that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the recommended measures yielding positive results, you should note that the most recent CSO data indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 14.3% year-on-year.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high level of last year.</p>  <p>  Finally it should be noted that the work of the CIWG on business insurance, in particular employer liability and public liability is ongoing and is expected to be concluded by the end of the year.  </p></reply>

They can elect to do so but the vast majority opt to remain unregistered.  The flat-rate scheme was designed to compensate these unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services relating to their activities.  The flat-rate scheme sets out a percentage amount, known as the flat-rate addition (FRA), which unregistered farmers apply to their prices when selling to VAT-registered businesses (for example, co-operatives, meat factories, etc).  The VAT-registered business treats the flat-rate amount as a normal business input in its periodic VAT return, claiming input credit for the flat-rate amount paid to the flat-rate farmer.  In this way, farmers are compensated for the VAT borne by them on their input costs, and this simplification reduces the administrative burden for them as there is no need to register for VAT to recover VAT borne on their inputs.</p>  <p>  A business model emerged in the poultry sector that exploits the interaction of the normal VAT system and the flat-rate scheme to engineer higher levels of flat-rate addition payments compared with the VAT borne on their input costs.  The model included the use of VAT-registered entities to recover VAT on costs borne on behalf of flat-rate farmers while those farmers continued to benefit from applying the flat-rate addition to their supplies.  In addition, the contra supply arrangements in relation to growing services and feedstuff that are widespread in the industry could be manipulated to increase the price of the growing service and hence the flat rate addition payment.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to recognise that businesses are free to organise their activities, within the law, to their economic advantage, including for the objective of minimising their tax liabilities or maximising the tax efficiency of their operations.  That essentially is what happened in this case; participants in the sector recognised and adopted structures and arrangements that had an obvious business rationale and which were also likely to increase the level of flat rate addition payments to unregistered growers in the sector. When this matter was brought to the attention of my Department, provision was made in Finance Act 2016 to enable the Minister for Finance to exclude sectors from the flat rate scheme where the business structures or models employed in that sector result in a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments over input costs borne by flat-rate farmers within that sector.  This measure provides a means for dealing with any sector in which systematic over recovery of VAT is engineered through the adoption of lawful business arrangements and structures and Revenue will deal with such sectors through the use of this provision.</p>  <p>   Following the introduction of this provision (by way of amendment to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010), Revenue undertook a detailed examination of the business structures, models and contractual arrangements in place between parties within the sector. As part of this review, Revenue met with all relevant parties including the Irish Farmers Association, poultry processors and representatives of co-operative societies operating in the sector during quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2017.  Following this engagement, co-operative societies undertook to recharge growers with all costs borne on their behalf plus VAT. The undertakings given by the co-operative societies address one of the mechanisms likely to result in overcompensation for flat rate farmers in the sector and I welcome this progress.  However, there is still scope for over-compensation through the use of contractual pricing arrangements and contra supplies between processors and growers.  I am advised by Revenue that they will shortly undertake a programme of audit type examinations of growers to establish if there is still a systematic excess of flat rate addition payments over VAT on input costs when account is taken of the recent changes implemented by cooperatives in the sector.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the industry has abandoned some of the activities likely to give rise to overcompensation of growers for their VAT costs.  It would serve the industry well to examine if the pricing structures they operate currently could result in overcompensation of growers for their input VAT costs and to adjust them if this is the case.  If the industry could provide empirical evidence that overcompensation is not arising at current price levels or will not arise at new price levels to be implemented in the industry, it would remove the need for Revenue to proceed with its programme of interventions.  I am committed to making an order to exclude the sector from the flat rate scheme if it proves necessary to do so.</p></reply>

The assessment commented positively on the buildings that Ireland has proposed, noting the high environmental standards of the proposed buildings, the capacity to offer additional space if required by the EBA, the ease of access to transport facilities for staff and visitors, and that they will be ready for the EBA to occupy prior to March 2019. </p>  <p>  The assessment was also favourable in terms of the business continuity dimension, and referred to Dublin's ability to retain staff due to language considerations and proximity to London, as well as access to the extensive pool of highly qualified staff.  We highlighted in our bid that the choice of Dublin would minimise disruption to the EBA and its staff, offering an easier adjustment for staff moving from London, thus supporting the retention of the highly qualified staff of the Authority. </p>  <p>  In line with the agreed selection procedure, and based on the Commission's assessment, there was a political discussion among the representatives of the Member States in the margins of the General Affairs Council on 17th October.  The Heads of State of government were informed about the political discussion amongst the ministers by the Estonian Presidency in the margins of the European Council (Article 50) on 19-20 October. </p>  <p>  Since the submission of our bid for the EBA our bid has been promoted by our EU missions as well as at Ministerial level. In addition, officials from my Department have held a series of bilateral engagements to promote our bid with different Member States over the last number of weeks. </p>  <p>  This approach will continue until the final decision on the relocation of the EBA is made.  This will be made by the 27 Member States through a voting process in the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 20th November 2017.</p></reply>

Up to &euro;750 million of ISIF funds will be allocated to HBFI to provide funding on market terms and the fund is estimated to have capacity to finance about 6,000 homes in the coming years.</p>  <p>  HBFI will not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender and therefore will not have any role in designing the housing mix contained in the schemes it funds.  HBFI will provide lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor. As such HBFI will not have targets in relation to social or affordable housing but will provide a significant contribution to supporting the delivery of additional supply of all types of residential housing in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Increasing the level of housing output will increase the affordability of housing more generally, which in turn also will have a positive effect on our ability to provide social housing.  For example, any residential developments funded by HBFI will be subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments.  This includes policies relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and as such, it is expected that a minimum of 10% of the anticipated output of this investment by HBFI will become available for social housing through this statutory mechanism over this period.</p>  <p>  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, the HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development. </p>  <p>  Though HBFI is intended to be a debt funder for private residential projects, I can assure the Deputy that this Government is equally determined to increase social housing output over the coming years.  For example, an increase of &euro;31 million has been allocated to the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme bringing the total to &euro;115 million.  This is expected to deliver an extra 4,000 social housing homes in 2018. In my Budget speech on 10 October 2017, I also announced an additional commitment to further accelerate the delivery of social housing from 2019.  I am providing an extra &euro;500 million for the direct building programme which will see an additional 3,000 new build social houses by 2021, increasing the existing Rebuilding Ireland target of social housing homes to 50,000, of which 33,500 will be delivered through construction.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for the review required that it also have regard to the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue on an ongoing basis and the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.  Dr Thornhill&rsquo;s review was informed by the outcomes of a public consultation which received 51 written submissions. </p>  <p>  Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report on his review of the Local Property Tax.  His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p>  <p>My predecessor subsequently proposed to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government.  As I indicated during my appearance before the Budgetary Oversight Committee on 27 September this work will be undertaken during 2018.  Naturally my Department will be engaging closely with in particular the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in this process.  I can assure the Deputy that this work will be done in good time and that the Government will make its position clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT.</p></reply>

More specifically, in relation to the beneficial ownership of trusts, Article 31 of the Directive contains an obligation on trustees of express trusts to obtain and hold information on the beneficial ownership of the trust, that is details of the person or persons who ultimately exercise ownership or control over the trust.  It also requires trustees to make this information available to competent authorities and FIUs (Financial Intelligence Units) in a timely manner and to disclose this information to obliged entities in specific circumstances.  The deadline set by the Commission for transposition was 26 June 2017.  </p>  <p>  However, since the final text of 4AMLD was published the Commission has (July 2016) proposed amendments which were intended to make extensive changes to Article 31 of 4AMLD.  We were awaiting the outcome of these negotiations so that they could be incorporated into our transposition.  Unfortunately, discussions have not progressed sufficiently to facilitate this approach.  For this reason and also due to the technical complexity of the measures and the need to engage with stakeholders to discuss an appropriate framework for the collection of this data, the transposition deadline has been passed.  This is the case with many other member states who are also still progressing their transpositions.  Having said this, work on transposing this directive is progressing and draft legislation to enact the requirements of Article 31 is with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for their consideration.</p></reply>

It is worth noting that this forecast is contingent on a number of variables, including the size of the overall EU budget for any individual year and other operational developments which will only emerge as the year progresses.  As such, these estimates are monitored and updated on an ongoing basis as new information becomes available.</p>  <p>  In relation to Brexit, as the Deputy will be aware, negotiations are currently on-going.  Therefore, as he can appreciate, it would not be advisable for me to discuss those negotiations in detail at this point.  Ireland wants a financial settlement reached in a fair and transparent manner on the basis of an agreed, objective methodology, that enables a positive future relationship between the EU and the UK and which reflects the UK's legal and budgetary commitments under the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken some modelling work to estimate the potential impact of Brexit on our EU budget contributions.  This analysis will be developed as the negotiations progress and when the Commission publishes its proposal on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (post 2020), currently expected to be released in May 2018.</p>  <p>  While my Department currently forecasts Ireland's contributions to the EU budget for 2021 to be &euro;2,775 million, this figure is used primarily for illustrative purposes.  It should also be noted that the 2021 forecast falls outside the current Multiannual Financial Framework and as such, should be treated with caution.

This includes the amount of the arrears to date and the interest rate applicable to the arrears, details of any charges in relation to the arrears that may be applied and the importance of the personal consumer engaging with the regulated entity in order to address the arrears.This must be updated every three months, where the arrears persist. </p><p>Where a regulated entity reaches an agreement on a revised repayment arrangement with a personal consumer, the regulated entity must provide the personal consumer with a clear explanation of the revised repayment arrangement and clarification on what data relating to the consumer&rsquo;s arrears will be shared with the Irish Credit Bureau or any other relevant credit reference agency.</p><p>In relation to a self employed person's credit rating being adversely impacted with regard to mortgage arrears resulting from the accumulation of debt during the period of negotiation on warehousing between the person and the financial institution, and it's consequent affects, the Central Bank has advised me that in December 2015, the Central Bank published new regulations for firms lending to small and medium enterprises (SME Regulations), with which regulated lenders (other than credit unions) have been required to comply with since 1 July 2016, and in the case of credit unions, from 1 January 2017.  </p><p>The SME Regulations aim to strengthen protections for SMEs when borrowing from regulated lenders while also facilitating access to credit.They also set out a framework which regulated entities must comply with when dealing with SME borrowers in arrears and financial difficulties.The SME Regulations require regulated entities to establish and maintain in writing policies and procedures for dealing with borrowers in financial difficulties.Regulated entities must make available to borrowers an information booklet, to include: </p><p>- a statement emphasising that it is in the borrower&rsquo;s interest to engage with the regulated entity about arrears or financial difficulties; </p><p>- a statement that the financial difficulties may impact on the borrower&rsquo;s credit rating; </p><p>- the option of an immediate review of the borrower&rsquo;s credit facilities.</p><p>Within 10 working days of a borrower entering financial difficulties, a regulated entity must inform the borrower of, among other things:  </p><p>- the status of the account; </p><p>- the applicability of the SME Regulations; </p><p>- the availability of the information booklet referred to above; and</p><p>- that it is in the borrower&rsquo;s interest to engage with the regulated entity about arrears or financial difficulties</p><p>Where a regulated entity offers an alternative arrangement to an SME borrower, the regulated entity must provide certain information in writing to the borrower including how the alternative arrangement will be reported by the regulated entity to a relevant credit reference agency or credit register and that it may impact on the borrower&rsquo;s credit rating.  The decision to grant credit is a commercial decision for lenders.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Budgets provided for an increase of 266 (126, 50 and 90 respectively) in additional staffing resources for Revenue to deal with a wide variety of requirements across audit and compliance functions, debt management functions, LPT, international tax and Brexit.  I have again provided for additional staffing in Revenue in this year&rsquo;s Budget.</p><p>Budget 2017 specified a number of compliance measures: amendments in relation to Section 110 and fund changes (projected yield of &euro;50 million), tackling offshore tax evasion (&euro;30 million) and increased resources for Revenue to confront non-compliance (&euro;50 million).  It is too early to accurately assess the impact of, or collection under, these headings for 2017.  This will not be possible until after the end of the year.  However, based on evidence to date, I am advised that Revenue expect the target will be exceeded.  This includes &euro;79 million collected from disclosures in relation to offshore assets.  Revenue will undertake detailed analysis of the Budget 2017 measures when data are available.</p><p>Budget 2018 includes an additional &euro;100 million to be raised from three compliance measures, in relation to employer PAYE compliance (&euro;50 million), eCommerce / online business compliance (&euro;30 million) and tax avoidance and base erosion capacity (&euro;20 million).  To support delivery of these measures, in the estimates for 2018 Revenue has been allocated an additional &euro;7m for extra staffing and ICT enhancements.</p><p>As noted, Budget 2016 also included similar compliance measures that were projected at the time of the Budget (October 2015) to yield an additional &euro;75 million to the Exchequer in 2016. Revenue has recently published analysis</p><p><i></i></p><p>This confirms the estimates of yield for the measures have been delivered and the target of &euro;75 million exceeded.  Conservative estimates show the measures in total yielded between &euro;120 million and &euro;150 million in the year.

The Scheme has been developed by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Enterprise Ireland and is supported by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the European Investment Bank Group and the European Commission.  The purpose of the Scheme is to assist Irish SMEs and Small Midcap firms with their working capital needs to allow them to adapt and innovate in response to Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is intended to operate under De Minimis state aid rules and will be supported by State and European guarantees.  Loans with flexible and competitive terms will be available to businesses with fewer than 499 employees that are exposed to the impact of Brexit.  However, primary producers in the agriculture and fishing sectors will be precluded from the Scheme due to state aid rules.</p>  <p>  My colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will provide further details of the Scheme shortly.</p>  <p>  As well as the Brexit Loan Guarantee Scheme, Irish SMEs will require support generally to diversify and restructure their businesses.

They include the SBCI, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.</p>  <p>  Viable Irish SMEs can access sustainable, flexible and appropriately priced finance through the SBCI.  Since March 2015, to the end of July 2017, the SBCI has provided &euro;855m of funding through its 7 on-lending partners to 21,132 Irish SMEs supporting 106,728 jobs.  The SBCI is working to develop a more diverse range of on-lenders and innovative products to meet the evolving requirements of the SME finance market, including mitigating the effects of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Advisory supports in relation to business planning, such as those provided by the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland, will be particularly important in assisting SMEs that may be adversely affected due to Brexit and will help raise awareness of both private market and State  supports.</p></reply>

The objective of this research was to assist credit unions and define and measure credit union viability.</p>  <p>  In the development of this discussion document CUAC undertook interviews with six credit unions and benefitted from engagement with representatives from the Central Bank, the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA).</p>  <p>  The key message from the discussion paper is that viability can be measured and that it is a function of two things, the surplus generated by the credit union&rsquo;s business model and the capital position of that credit union.</p>  <p>  The Committee, which has a broad range of knowledge and experience on credit union matters, continues to look at topical issues for credit unions with a view to providing advice and timely reports to me.</p>  <p>  CUAC also presented its report titled &lsquo;Review of Implementation of the Recommendations in the Commission on Credit Unions Report&rsquo;, to the then Minister on 29th June 2016.  This report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2016.</p>  <p>  In its review CUAC recommended the establishment of an Implementation Group for a specified period of time.  The Implementation Group was established to oversee and monitor implementation of CUAC&rsquo;s recommendations in a methodical manner and to advise me of progress.  To date, the Implementation Group has met seven times.  It comprises a representative from ILCU, CUDA, the Credit Union Managers&rsquo; Association (CUMA), the National Supervisors Forum (NSF), the Central Bank and a CUAC representative.  This broad membership ensures participation and encourages contribution from all credit union perspectives.</p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving regular progress reports on implementation of these very important recommendations.</p></reply>

While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of roll-over risk should interest rates increase.  We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual. Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining sound public finances.</p>  <p>  With regard to changing the EU fiscal rules set out in the Stability and Growth Pact, proposals would have to be made by the European Commission in the first instance, and I not aware of such initiatives by the European Commission.</p>  <p>  However, as I have stated previously for the Deputy in Parliamentary Question No. 78 of the 18th of May 2017 and number 128 of the 4th of July 2017, the issue of facilitating greater flexibility within the application of the fiscal rules has received significant focus at European level and framed discussions on the establishment of the structural and investment clauses, which were codified by the Commission in November 2015.  Specifically these provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment, subject to strict conditions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, there is existing flexibility within the expenditure benchmark whereby capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that any decision to increase capital expenditure over and above already planned levels would need to balance the danger of potentially over-heating in the economy with the need to address infrastructure priorities and risks such as Brexit.</p></reply>

This follows annual growth of 5.2 per cent in the first quarter.</p>  <p>  Strong GDP growth is being confirmed by developments in the labour market.  Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.4 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2017, representing the creation of over 48,000 additional jobs over the year.  The increase in employment remains broad based with gains recorded in 11 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.  Since the low-point in 2012 there are now an additional 230,000 people in employment.</p>  <p>  The continued growth in employment has seen the unemployment rate fall from over 15 per cent in 2012 to 6.1 per cent in September 2017 which is close to the level considered to represent full employment in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The strong performance of the labour market is set to continue in the short term.  As part of Budget 2018, my Department is projecting that an additional 48,000 jobs will be created next year.</p>  <p>  However, there are a number of risks at present including the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU, related to this the risk of a loss in competitiveness, and the possibility of significant tax reform in the US.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness.  The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 19 per cent between its peak in 2008 and September 2017.  However, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling rate is posing significant challenges particularly for the traditional manufacturing sector, the tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade.</p>  <p>  These sources of uncertainty highlight the importance of prudent management of the public finances.  While Ireland&rsquo;s debt to GDP ratio has come down considerably in recent years, a significant factor in this has been GDP growth, which can be exaggerated in an Irish context.  In response to the well-known limitations with GDP and GNP figures, the CSO has published an alternative measure of economic activity titled modified Gross National Income or GNI*.  Using GNI* as the denominator highlights the still elevated levels of debt in the Irish economy, and the importance of sensible budgetary policies.  It is also important to focus on competitiveness-oriented policies that improve the resilience of the economy to ensure that we are in a better position to weather any global shocks which materialise.</p>  <p>  In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain stable and that our economic fundamentals are strong, although the level of uncertainty remains elevated.  In this regard, it is critical that appropriate polices are implemented and that is what the Government will continue to do.</p></reply>

This analysis of the Budget is undertaken and published every year by the ESRI. The article this year was headlined &ldquo;Budget 2018 leads to small losses in income at all levels&rdquo;. I believe that this headline &ndash; which I assume the Deputy is referring to in her question - is both incorrect in its own right and is unreflective of the full article written by the ESRI. </p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that the ESRI analysis reflects a specific modelling approach rather than the direct impact of tax and welfare measures on people&rsquo;s incomes, which is the basis on which Budgets are set. Their analysis relies on the SWITCH (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) model, a model also used by Government departments, to assess the distributional impact of the Budget. The SWITCH model is a tax-benefit micro-simulation model which allows users to analyse the impact of discretionary tax and social welfare policy in a way that is representative of the full population of households in Ireland. However, the methodology applied to the SWITCH model by the ESRI differs from the methodology used by Government departments.</p>  <p>  The ESRI analysis compares Budget 2018 to a hypothetical scenario where all tax bands, tax credits and welfare payments are increased by 3.1 percent, which is the ESRI&rsquo;s forecast of wage growth for 2018. They refer to this hypothetical scenario in the article as a &ldquo;neutral benchmark&rdquo;. By comparing Budget 2018 to this hypothetical scenario, they estimate that the Budget results in relative income losses. In other words, the ESRI did not say in their article that Budget 2018 directly imposes income losses on households, but rather that the Budget imposes losses relative to the ESRI&rsquo;s choice of benchmark.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that their method does not result in a measure of the actual change in people&rsquo;s incomes by income group due to the budget. In contrast, my Department&rsquo;s methodology compares a situation where the existing 2017 tax and welfare parameters remain in place in 2018, to an alternative situation where the Budget 2018 tax and welfare parameters are applied. This method reflects the actual change in people&rsquo;s incomes resulting from the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2018, and I believe it is more informative than the ESRI approach when assessing the direct impact of the Budget on household incomes in 2018.</p>  <p>  I further note that in the main text of the article the ESRI acknowledge that the assumption of indexing tax and social welfare parameters to wage growth is costly; they estimate it would cost in the region of &euro;1.1 billion. The Budget Day Package, net of the &euro;180 million allocated to the Public Service Stability Agreement, is approximately &euro;1.2 billion. In line with the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Confidence and Supply arrangement, this is distributed on a 70:30 basis between expenditure and taxation measures, which exceeds the split outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. With this fiscal context in mind, the ESRI&rsquo;s hypothetical scenario of wage indexation is not affordable in 2018 given the other key priorities for Government expenditure such as housing and education.</p>  <p>  The elements of the Budget 2018 tax package relating to reductions to USC, increases to the income tax standard rate bands and increases to the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit amount to a cost of &euro;333 million on a first year and &euro;397 million on a full-year basis.</p>  <p>  No Government has followed a policy of strict indexation of tax bands and/or tax credits, as this does not allow flexibility to adapt spending as necessary to the level of resources available to the Government in any given Budget.  It would also restrict the ability of the Government to target resources where the need is greatest. </p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) will produce and publish a Social Impact Assessment of Budget 2018 in the coming weeks. This will use the SWITCH model to consider the impact of the Budget on households across the income distribution. My Department provides inputs to DEASP when they are preparing the Social Impact Assessment. However, preliminary analysis carried out in advance of the Budget by my Department using the SWITCH model indicated that, in overall terms, households experience an average increase in the order of 1% in weekly disposable income as a result of Budget 2018. Gains are highest for the first (lowest income) quintile at over 2 per cent and lowest for the fifth (highest income) quintile at below 1 per cent, pointing to a progressive Budget package. These gains represent the actual change in people&rsquo;s incomes resulting from the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2018, and I would point out that the percentage gains are greatest for the least well-off.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual policies nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases. </p><p>The Deputy should note that all insurers operating in the Irish market are regulated under conduct of business rules by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Consequently, each is required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code which sets out the rights of consumers, including how claims are handled.</p><p>In relation to the bringing to the attention of policyholders their rights in relation to insurance claims arising from Storm Ophelia, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has updated its website accordingly and the information can be found at: .</p><p>In addition, my officials have been in touch with Insurance Ireland about this matter.  In response they have indicated that business insurance policies will provide cover for storm damage to premises and stock.  Such policies will also cover for business interruption which is triggered when there has been storm damage to the premises.  They have advised, however, that it is important for businesses to contact their insurance company or broker after the event and guidance will be provided on making a claim.  </p><p>With regard to household buildings and contents insurance, Insurance Ireland has also advised that policies will cover damage caused by storms.  Insurers will usually pay for the cost of temporary repairs, so policyholders should keep receipts.  Insurers will also usually pay for the cost of alternative accommodation, if the home has become uninhabitable.  However, householders should check the full extent of their policies and contact their insurer or broker for further information.</p><p>Finally, in respect of household insurance generally, the Central Statistics Office reports on price movements in relation to insurance connected with dwellings as part of their Consumer Prices Monthly Series.  According to the official data from the Central Statistics Office, the cost of insurance connected with dwellings has remained largely stable over the last five years, with small increases and decreases at various times.  At the beginning of this year it was 6.2% higher than it had been at the beginning of 2012.  On a month-on-month basis, January and February 2017 saw increases of 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively, and this was followed by four months without a price movement.

Such a system limits the transferability of tax bands and credits from a non-earning spouse to the earning spouse, with the stated economic objectives of increasing labour force participation among secondary earners and reducing the numbers of workers paying the higher rates of income tax.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this move towards an individualised tax system, and in order to ensure a balance was maintained between those going out to work and families with caring responsibilities in the home, a Home Carer&rsquo;s tax allowance was introduced for married one-income families where one spouse works primarily in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons.</p>  <p>  This allowance was subsequently converted into the Home Carer Tax Credit (HCC), and the Deputy will be aware that, in Budget 2018, I announced that the HCC, which is of benefit to over 80,000 families annually, is being increased from &euro;1,100 to &euro;1,200 per annum.  This follows from an increase in last year&rsquo;s Budget from &euro;1,000 and an increase from &euro;810 in Budget 2016 giving a total increase in the credit over the last three Budgets of &euro;390.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to extend the credit to all households, I note that the Deputy&rsquo;s question does not define household for this purpose &ndash; for example it is not clear if the Deputy envisages extending the credit to single person households, single parent households and/or double income households.  In this regard, I would note that extending the credit to households other than single-earner households with caring responsibilities in the home would run counter to the policy rationale underpinning the credit since its introduction.</p>  <p>  As with all tax credits, the HCC has the potential to be of benefit only to qualifying recipients with sufficient levels of taxable income to absorb the credit.  For example, a single-income, PAYE earner family will see a benefit from the HCC where household income exceeds &euro;24,750, as income of up to this amount can be sheltered from tax by the married personal tax credit of &euro;3,300 and the PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650.  The basis for the figure of &euro;29,000 stated in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is unclear, however I would note that there would be no cost, and no associated benefit for the relevant individuals, of extending a tax credit to households that do not have sufficient taxable income to utilise it.</p></reply>

The Central Bank takes these obligations very seriously and complies with them on an on-going basis as appropriate, and it has met with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other entities.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which falls under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, has its own statutory remit and if it considers that there have been breaches of company law it would be a matter for that body to consider the appropriate action to pursue.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), the FSO deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all regulated financial service providers.  The FSO tries, in the first instance, to resolve complaints in an informal manner by mediation through its dedicated Dispute Resolution Service.  However, where disputes are not resolved through mediation the FSO will investigate and adjudicate on the complaint.  The FSO has a wide range of powers and can direct compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and direct rectification which could, for example, include redress, where a borrower has been charged the incorrect interest rate, and restoration to the correct rate.  While a person who obstructs the Financial Services Ombudsman in the exercise of his functions and powers or fails to comply with requirements or requests during an investigation may be guilty of an offence and subject to criminal sanction, the FSO does not, however, have the power to apply criminal sanctions for actions of a financial service provider in their dealings with individual consumers.</p></reply>

As these estimates relate to measures being implemented in 2018 they will be impacted by the actual cost and timing of implementation and consequently the estimated costs will be reassessed as part of the Budget Estimates process for 2019 as set out in the expenditure report, these costs would need to be met from the unallocated resources in 2019 or from savings/reprioritisations identified, for example through the Spending Review process.</p><p>In relation to the Budget 2018 tax measures it is estimated that there would be a total carryover cost into 2019 of &euro;14 million.  For 2020 and 2021 the carryover impact is revenue generating (shown in the table with a negative sign) which will increase fiscal space.</p><p>I should point out that the exact impacts of carryover will be reviewed as part of the normal Budgetary process, as there are a lot of moving parts to be considered, such as economic growth, take up of various schemes and specific tax relevant factors, which could impact on the expected return from the measures.</p><p>Finally, I would also like to reiterate that choosing the right budgetary <i>stance</i>should be the guiding principle going forward.

The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out in an action plan within the Report.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The third such update was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 23 October 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations.  In total, 32 actions were due for completion in the first three quarters of the year and 29 of those actions have been completed.  Updates on the state of play of the three outstanding actions are provided in the third progress report.  It should be also noted that substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as "ongoing".</p>  <p>  I believe that the continued implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12-18 months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for September) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 14.3% year-on-year.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained with the result that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of last year.</p></reply>

In 2016 annual inflation in Ireland &ndash; as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was slightly negative at -0.2 per cent.</p>  <p>  While inflation has picked up in the rest of the euro area, inflationary pressures have remained muted in Ireland in 2017.  This is largely due to the continued impact from euro-sterling exchange rate developments.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, futures markets for oil are suggesting oil prices will continue to stay around their current low levels over the course of 2018.  In addition, non-energy industrial goods are likely to continue to be a significant drag on inflation next year, reflecting euro-sterling exchange rate developments.  Against this, the continued growth in domestic demand and the ongoing recovery in the labour market are expected to lead to further services price inflation.  Taking all these factors into account, price pressures are expected to rise only modestly in 2018.  As part of Budget 2018, my Department forecast HICP annual inflation of 0.2 per cent for this year, rising gradually to 0.8 per cent in 2018.</p>  <p>  While consumer price inflation is not expected to rise dramatically over the near term, my Department continues to monitor inflation developments very closely.  Any emergence of sustained price inflation would put pressure on the competitiveness of those sectors that are heavily dependent on exports.  This is particularly true for the indigenous manufacturing, the agrifood sector and price sensitive service sectors.  In this regard, it is important that, at firm level, overall costs do not get out of line with our competitors and that pay moves in line with productivity developments.</p>  <p>  This government will therefore continue to implement competitiveness oriented policies which is the best way domestically to counteract any inflationary tendencies and potential loss of competitiveness.</p></reply>

Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.</p><p>Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo;.  Loans can be sold by regulated entities to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank).</p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various Statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.</p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection framework.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms with each borrower by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by reference to that&rsquo;s borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p><p>Regulated entities, including credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners, are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:</p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;</p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution</p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  A regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the firm has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.</p><p>Details on the protections and options available to a borrower under Irish personal insolvency legislation can be found at isi.gov.ie, should this be of relevance.  This aspect of the framework of protections for individuals (including mortgage borrowers) is overseen by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, not the Central Bank.</p><p>In relation to addressing the situation arising from potential large scale repossessions of family homes directly or indirectly through repossession of buy to let properties, the position is that I am unable to interfere in the commercial decisions of any financial institution.  However, the Government attaches great importance to the resolution of mortgage arrears and wants to keep families in their homes and avoid repossessions insofar as possible.</p><p>Across state agencies, there are numerous bodies and processes in place to assist those in mortgage arrears in the hope of avoiding repossession.  Most recently, the Abhaile service has been established and offers help to borrowers in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, if possible, in their own homes.  This is assisting borrowers, particularly those in longer term arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in arrears and their lender to find the best solution for them.  Borrowers can get free advice from an expert financial adviser who can help them to work through their financial situation.  An Expert adviser could be from MABS or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant.  Borrowers may also need legal advice and under Abhaile they can have a free meeting with a solicitor.  If called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court.  A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.</p><p>A Helpline is available Monday to Friday and a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 MABS locations nationwide.</p><p>Finally, I refer you to the latest Central Bank publication for Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics: Q2 2017 which can be found at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>This shows that further progress is being made in addressing the mortgage arrears issue.  The number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears continued to fall in Q2 2017, marking the 16th consecutive quarterly decline.  A total of 73,706 (10%) of accounts were in arrears at end-Q2, a decline of 3.6% relative to Q1 and a decline of 48% since Q2 of 2013.  All maturity categories of arrears declined in Q2 2017.  There are very positive signs in relation to the amount of accounts which have been restructured, 120,398 by end June 2017 and of these restructured accounts, 87% are were deemed to be meeting the terms of their restructuring arrangement.</p></reply>

The Government is aware of the significant issues facing the housing market and it is committed to restoring the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium by seeking to increase the supply of housing to meet growing demand.</p><p>In order to deliver on an ambitious target of building 25,000 new homes by 2020, <i>Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, adopts a whole of government response with 84 actionable measures across five key pillars.  The Government has been engaged in a review of Rebuilding Ireland, in order to assess the impact of the policies contained within the Action Plan, and to consider additional actions to address issues with supply in the housing market.  The measures set out in the Action Plan and its review should help to stimulate supply by streamlining the planning system, removing infrastructure blockages and supporting the delivery of affordable housing for both first time buyers and purchasers of family homes.</p><p>The Help-to-Buy initiative, which was retained in Budget 2018, should help alleviate some of the specific challenges faced by first time buyers in accessing the housing market.  The initiative has been designed to provide immediate and targeted support for first time buyers in meeting their deposit requirements and encouraging the construction of new housing units whilst the structural measures announced in the Action Plan are being rolled out.  My Department commissioned Indecon, an economic consultancy, to complete an independent impact assessment of the Help-to-Buy initiative in March.  The report was published with all the Budget 2018 documents and found that, to date, there has been no identifiable impact of the Help-to-Buy initiative on house prices.  It further found that the initiative has enhanced affordability for first time buyers and that it has reduced the number of years required for purchasers to save a deposit for new homes.</p><p>Budget 2018 contained a number of other initiatives that will assist in lowering the cost of building homes and increasing affordability, including for first time buyers.  Such measures include the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland, which has &euro;750 million to lend to home builders and an additional &euro;75 million allocation for the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund.</p></reply>

More directly, credit and market conditions, mortgage default rates and the funding of mortgage credit will also be relevant factors.</p>  <p>  However, there have been some developments which seek to promote a more harmonised market for credit across the EU.  In particular, the 2014 Mortgage Credit Directive, which has now been transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, seeks to develop a more harmonised, efficient and competitive internal market for the provision of residential mortgages to consumer borrowers and this should help to promote the closer integration of EU mortgage markets over time.</p>  <p>  In terms of the national context, the issue of the level of variable mortgage rates is an important one for this Government and it is committed to reducing the cost of secured mortgage lending and promoting competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has recently produced a report which sets out options for consideration to help improve the level of competition and general efficiency of the market.  Additionally, the Central Bank has recently carried out research which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages.</p>  <p>  Following on from this, and building on the 2016 addendum to the Consumer Protection Code in relation to standard variable rate mortgage holders, last August the Central Bank  published a consultation paper proposing new measures which would enhance the framework of protections for variable rate mortgage holders and in particular to require lenders to, inter alia, better inform consumers about other available mortgage options that could save them money, to help them compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options and to provide consumers with standardised switching information.  A copy of the Consultation Paper is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website and the consultation process will be open for comment until 1 November 2017.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that the development of a healthy banking system, which is one which delivers increased competition, which is in a position to provide finance to credit worthy customers and which is also resilient to economic and financial market shocks, is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.</p></reply>

I understand that thousands of submissions were received, reviewed and considered before a draft NPF was drawn up.  The draft entitled <i>Ireland 2040- Our Plan </i>is now available, together with a number of environmental reports and other supporting information on the website <i>(www.npf.ie)</i>.  I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that submissions on the draft can be made from 27th September until 12 Noon on Friday November 3rd.</p><p>In relation to the National Investment Plan (2018-2027), a consultation was conducted earlier this year between 31 March and 30 April as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While the public consultation was focused on the allocation of available capital resources over the period out to 2021, views and evidence were also sought on infrastructure investment over the longer 10 year period.</p><p>Further details on that consultation, along with the published submissions which were received, can be found on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website</p><p><i>www.per.gov.ie/en/capital-investment-plan-2016-2021/.</i></p><p>The views and opinions expressed in that consultation informed the findings of the Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 14 September.  Furthermore, it is currently planned that a consultative forum will be held by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in November with key stakeholders and experts including those that responded to the public consultation on the review of the Capital Plan to discuss the findings and recommendations of the Review.</p></reply>

It was established in 2012.  As set out in its Medium Term Strategy out to 2019, the aim of the IGEES is to contribute to the better design and targeting of Government policy and better outcomes for citizens.  It does this by building on existing analytical work and playing a lead role in policy analysis.</p>  <p>  IGEES is not a stand-alone service. IGEES staff are part of each Department adding their skill set to the varied expertise working on policy analysis and formulation as directed by Departmental business plans.  By operating as a cross Government service, IGEES supports and builds economic and evaluation capacity and consistency across the civil service.</p>  <p>  The IGEES model involves units and roles embedded in each Government Department, and each Department meets the costs of those from within its existing resources.  IGEES numbers across Government Departments have grown since 2012 combining new recruitment with the assignment of existing staff.  IGEES numbers have increased from just over 30 in 2012, to over 50 in 2013, around 70 in 2014, around 80 in 2015, around 90 in 2016.  At present, there are 120 persons active in IGEES roles (62 recruited through the IGEES recruitment stream and 58 from existing Departmental resources).  In terms of the IGEES recruitment, the average annual intake for the period 2012-2017 was just below 20.</p>  <p>  From 2012 to 2016, costs were almost entirely related to pay &ndash; for existing qualified economic and evaluation staff and for newly recruited economic and evaluation staff &ndash; and formed part of each Department&rsquo;s overall pay allocation as presented in the Revised Estimates Volume.  In 2017, a budget for the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service of &euro;200,000 was included in Vote 11 Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for IGEES.  This budget is supporting the roll out of the IGEES Medium Term Strategy in building capacity through recruitment and learning and development, generating an increased level of high quality output, and providing greater input into and impact on the policy analysis process in the civil service.</p></reply>

Once a company is dissolved, its assets vest in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The vesting is automatic and does not require any intervention from the Minister.</p>  <p>  The balance of the State Property Miscellaneous Deposits Account, which accepts amounts relating to dissolved companies, is &euro;13,944,274.  The account is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p>  <p>  The money entering this account is classified as a financial transaction, thus there is no beneficial impact to the General Government Balance under the European System of Accounts 2010.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) is responsible for the official reporting of Ireland&rsquo;s General Government Balance, General Government Debt and other Government Finance Statistics. </p>  <p>  The interest acquired by the Minister is described as a defeasible interest as it may be defeated by restoration of the company.  Neither company nor property law require comprehensive and fully up-to-date asset records to be lodged with the Company Registration Office and the Property Registration Authority.  Consequently, the only persons with a complete view of the assets held by a company at the time of its dissolution are the directors and officers of the company.  As a result, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform only becomes aware that assets have vested in him by virtue of the State Property Act 1954 once he has been notified by an interested party seeking to have the property waived or by another person that has an issue with the property. In the circumstances it is not possible to provide the table suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am, however, aware that some schools have experienced difficulty in recruiting adequately qualified substitute teachers, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing this issue. I have received correspondence from principals of primary schools in Dublin 15 concerning this issue. </p>  <p>The final report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; was published on 9 June 2017.  The report focusses on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, while outlining the work which will be required to establish a sustainable long term model of post primary teacher supply. In considering the model of teacher supply at primary level the report took account of many variables, including the number of additional teachers required to cover for teacher absences, such as illness, maternity leave, career break or secondment.</p>  <p>  The report sets out an approach to planning the work necessary to develop a model for achieving a better balance between teacher supply and demand in the medium to long term. Officials of my Department are now considering how the development of a model can be progressed, from within available resources.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, in conjunction with the publication of the report, I announced a number of measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short term vacancies. With regard to these measures, my Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council. In that regard, the Teaching Council also reminds teachers, through the renewal of registration process and where a teacher indicates that he or she is considering leaving the register, that if they wish to continue to work as a teacher following retirement in substitute and other positions they should maintain registration. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that my Department has increased to 90 days the limit on the number of days a primary teacher who is on career break can be employed in a school year. The matter of the employment of B Ed and PME students in limited circumstances on a short term basis is still under consideration in my Department.</p></reply>

All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme.</p>  <p>  Under the current programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,100 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). Some 900 of those schools have now been connected with the balance to be in place by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Significant improvement has been made in recent years with the number of primary schools on broadband speeds of greater than 30mbs having increased from less than 100 in 2012 to over 1000 by the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  The policy of this Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints.  Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p>  <p>  In the case of the school referred to be the Deputy, the Schools Broadband Service Desk and the current Service Provider have reviewed the service provided, and they advise that the school is on the best broadband solution available at present. </p>  <p>  According to the latest National Broadband Plan Mapping, the school in question is in an amber area, that is, an area that is not considered commercial by operators. This area will be covered under the State Intervention of the National Broadband Plan. Under the National Broadband Plan, the government has committed to intervening to ensure high speed broadband is available in parts of the country where commercial providers alone will not provide the essential services. This commitment to intervene will ensure that no school is left behind.</p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist in regard to any direct intervention in the case.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils' not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory, and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that, as regards that policy, principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department or, - in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, - to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student, or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p><p>Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on this Departments website at the following link: </p><p>or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co.

Secondments are a temporary arrangement renewable on a year to year basis. While on secondment, teachers retain their school post, the terms and conditions that apply to teachers and receive their salary and a secondment allowance which are met in full by my Department.</p>  <p>  In 2010, a new policy of secondment was negotiated with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform (DPER).  The policy sanctioned a new limit on secondment numbers and established an upper limit of 5 years on the length of a secondment, following which the Directors return to their posts either as a teacher or an inspector.</p>  <p>  There are many benefits from the revised policy for teachers, their boards of management and the system as a whole.  Because an upper limit of 5 years now applies to secondments, there is:</p>  <p>- confidence that the teachers involved in the delivery of CPD have recent experience of the curriculum and of the school environment</p>  <p>- certainty about secondment parameters which assist individual teachers and their boards of management in planning.</p>  <p>  There are more opportunities for teachers to take on career enhancing roles in the support services and the Centres. Teachers returning to their school after a period of secondment have the potential to enrich their school environment and they become eligible to take on subsequent secondment opportunities after a period back in their school.</p>  <p>  Regular turnover of seconded teachers is now an established practice with teachers returning to enrich their schools so the investment in their skills is not lost.  Since 2010, 10 Education Centres have successfully recruited new Directors and the work of the Centres has not been negatively affected.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the regulations I promulgated under Section 37(6) of the Education Act underpins my Departments secondment policy for the secondment of Directors to Education Support Centres.</p></reply>

However, I believe that these can be resolved within the timeframe set out by the Secretary of State last week.  Time is now a very real factor, with budgetary and other necessary decisions looming in relation to the provision of public services in Northern Ireland. These need to be addressed by effective and sustainable devolved government in Northern Ireland, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government&rsquo;s focus remains firmly on the restoration of the Executive.  The essential work of the North South Ministerial Council also needs to urgently recommence, not least in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the political parties will urgently and successfully conclude their discussions which will allow the Executive and Assembly, and indeed all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, to function effectively. </p>  <p>  On behalf of the Government, I will continue to make all possible efforts, working with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, to support an agreement on the formation of a new power-sharing Executive in the immediate period ahead.</p></reply>

Furthermore, on 13 October the Security Council heard from Kofi Annan, Chair of the independent Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, longstanding drivers of tensions between the Buddhist majority and the Muslim Rohingya communities of Rakhine State must be addressed and resolved.  The report of the Annan-led Advisory Commission provides a roadmap to surmount the political, socio-economic and humanitarian challenges that currently face Rakhine State.  The Government of Myanmar has committed to implementing its recommendations, which include proposals to alleviate poverty for all communities in Rakhine State and the resolution of issues that predominantly affect the Rohingya, such as citizenship.  Ireland and the international community is calling for the recommendations to be comprehensively and swiftly implemented.</p>  <p>  In tandem with political engagement, the response to the crisis has also sought to alleviate suffering and meet the immediate humanitarian needs of people displaced by violence in Rakhine State, especially those now in Bangladesh. </p>  <p>  According to the UN, international humanitarian efforts have to date delivered emergency food assistance to nearly 490,000 people; water and sanitation support to 300,000 refugees and host communities; immunisation to 150,000 children; shelter kits to 150,000 people; and counselling and trauma support to over 50,000 people. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the UN&rsquo;s revised response plan for Bangladesh anticipates a humanitarian funding need of US$434 million over the next five months.  To this end a Pledging Conference for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis was held in Geneva yesterday, 23 October, co-hosted by Kuwait and the EU.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to supporting the crisis response and at the conference yesterday pledged &euro;2m in direct support.  We have provided &euro;460,000 to the emergency response so far and have pledged to provide an additional &euro;540,000 for programmes in the remainder of 2017.  For 2018 we will allocate an indicative budget of &euro;1m.  Ireland is directing humanitarian and development support to key civil society and other trusted partners in Bangladesh and Myanmar, including the air shipment of vital supplies to affected communities.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to closely monitor the humanitarian situation as it unfolds.</p></reply>

Ireland has repeatedly called on the Government of Azerbaijan to release Mr Mammadov without delay and to fully implement the judgment in this and other related cases. Ireland is a firm supporter of the Council of Europe which it views as an indispensable platform for the promotion and protection of human rights standards across Europe.  Ireland places particular emphasis on the importance of the European Convention on Human Rights and on the obligation on Member States to abide by a final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in any case to which they are a party.  In light of Azerbaijan&rsquo;s ongoing refusal to implement this judgment, Ireland fully supports Secretary General Jagland&rsquo;s proposal that the Committee of Ministers refer to the Court the question of whether Azerbaijan has failed to fulfil its obligation to abide by the judgment of the Court in this case.  I would urge the Government of Azerbaijan to implement the judgment immediately, to avoid the need to refer the case to the Court.</p></reply>

The latest actions taken by North Korea, particularly the nuclear test on 3 September, are a major challenge to international efforts to advance global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  This has been a longstanding goal of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Our leadership on this critical global issue was given most recent expression when Ireland co-chaired the 31st Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Plenary Meeting in Dublin last week.  The deeply worrying developments in North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and missile programmes present a real threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, the entire North East Asia region, and indeed beyond.  Such actions represent a flagrant and provocative violation of North Korea&rsquo;s international obligations not to conduct such tests.  I have unreservedly condemned such actions.  The government&rsquo;s concerns are shared by EU partners.  The Foreign Affairs Council adopted Council Conclusions on North Korea on 17 July this year.  The Council stressed that lasting peace and the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula must be achieved through peaceful means.  It highlighted the importance of the unity of the international community in addressing this challenge. </p>  <p>  At its most recent meeting on 16 October, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted new EU autonomous restrictive measures against North Korea to further increase pressure on the regime to comply with its obligations.  The measures complement and reinforce UN Security Council sanctions.  The Foreign Affairs Council also agreed to actively lobby for a robust implementation of all relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the part of all UN member states.</p>  <p>  The United Nations General Assembly in New York in September presented an opportunity for the international community to further demonstrate its resolve in this regard, and I conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s grave concern about ongoing developments.  I unreservedly condemned North Korea&rsquo;s programme of missile and nuclear weapon testing in my address to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>  <p>  Most recently this resolve to implement the sanctions regime was re-affirmed by the European Council on 19 October, and a commitment was made to consider further responses in close consultation with partners. </p>  <p>  Throughout, we have been very clear in stating that North Korea must cease the series of provocative acts that have contributed to growing instability in the region and further afield.  It must re-engage with discussions on the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, immediately and without pre-conditions.  It must abandon its programmes to develop ballistic missiles, nuclear capabilities and weapons of mass destruction.  It must carry out these processes in a manner that is complete, verifiable and irreversible.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the international sanctions regime against North Korea, and emphasises that continued disregard of its international obligations will only lead to increased diplomatic isolation.  We believe greater emphasis should be placed on effective implementation of the sanctions regime, but further sanctions cannot be ruled out.</p>  <p>  The deteriorating situation on the Korean Peninsula can only be resolved by peaceful means, and we have repeatedly underscored the urgent need for dialogue between all stakeholders.  We will continue to be a strong voice for a peaceful outcome, and we will work closely with our international partners to this end.</p></reply>

This support includes political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace, but also action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity,<b></b>which are progressively endangering the prospects of such a peace agreement.  Ireland has been an advocate of EU measures which distinguish between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory such as the territorial clause in the EU-Israel research agreement and the guidelines on the labelling of products originating from the settlements.</p><p>The initiative led by France, which culminated at the Paris Conference in January this year, and which the Government fully supported, restated international support for the two state solution but was unable to achieve international agreement on how to revive the political process to reach that objective.  In recent months the new United States administration has been actively exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement.  This engagement is very welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused.  In recent discussions with my EU colleagues, I have urged that the EU must both strongly support the US initiative, but also continue our own work on the ground to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved.  I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done.</p></reply>

This evidence is then intended for eventual use in fair and independent criminal proceedings, consistent with applicable international law, conducted by competent national-level courts. </p>  <p>  In relation to financial resources, the resolution envisages the establishment of a trust fund to receive voluntary contributions to create and operationalise this Investigative Team.

Ireland has consistently called for inclusive, democratic solutions to the conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa region.  In the Iraqi context, we have emphasised that the security effort must be accompanied by the implementation of the programme for national reconciliation set out by Prime Minister Abadi in late 2014 to avoid further sectarian divisions.  The June EU Foreign Affairs Council conclusions on Iraq reiterated the EU&rsquo;s firm and active commitment to the preservation of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-confessional nature of Iraqi society, including the protection of its minority groups, and called for an inclusive process of reconciliation both at the national and at the local level.  Ireland fully supports these conclusions. </p>  <p>  Since 2015, &euro;350 million has been dedicated by the EU to provide emergency assistance in response to the humanitarian consequences of the current conflict in Iraq.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;8.36 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Iraq and has also deployed four members of its Rapid Response Corps to Iraq to provide surge capacity to UN organisations working to respond to the humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.  We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  </p>  <p>  Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN Human Rights Council, during the Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review of the human rights records of UN Member States, as well as at the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  The promotion of inclusive societies where the human rights of all individuals are respected is a core objective of our engagement on issues such as the promotion of freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief. </p>  <p>  I would like to put on record my absolute and unreserved condemnation of the brutal atrocities committed against the Yazidis and other religious minorities in Iraq by terrorist groups including Daesh.</p></reply>

The Courts Service does not have this expertise itself and is reliant on OPW resources to undertake and manage the task. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that a great deal of technical investigations and analysis has been carried out on the railings by the OPW in order to determine how best to restore the railings and that the actual restoration work will be undertaken in stages.  The Courts Service has approved funding for the first phase of the restoration works which will see 10 of the 66 bays or sections of the railings fully restored.  A procurement process in respect of the restoration of the initial 10 bays or sections will be undertaken by the OPW and it is anticipated that the procurement will begin before the end of year with the actual restoration work to begin during the first quarter of 2018.  This initial work will inform how future phases will be undertaken.</p></reply>

The entitlement is created in Section 6 of the Act in relation to &ldquo;an employee who is a relevant parent.&rdquo;  The criteria in relation to &ldquo;relevant parent&rdquo; are set out in Section 2 of the Act as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;Relevant Parent&rdquo;, in relation to a child, means a person (other than the mother of the child) who is&mdash;</p><p>(a) in the case of a child who is, or is to be, adopted&mdash;</p><p>(i) where the child is, or is to be, adopted jointly by a married couple of the same sex, the spouse chosen by that couple to be the relevant parent for the purposes of this Act, or</p><p>(ii) in any other case, the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, as the case may be, of the adopting mother or sole male adopter of the child,</p><p>or</p><p>(b) in any other case&mdash;</p><p>(i) the father of the child,</p><p>(ii) the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, as the case may be, of the mother of the child, or</p><p>(iii) a parent of the child under section 5 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 where the child is a donor-conceived child within the meaning of Part 2 of that Act;</p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s questions presume a link between guardianship and paternity leave.  However, there is no connection between the two processes.  The entitlement to paternity leave and benefit arises from qualification as a &ldquo;relevant parent&rdquo; as defined under the Act, and does not depend on whether or not that parent is also a guardian of the child.</p></reply>

The implementation of the Report at this remove, and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged, would require a detailed consideration of the merits and impacts in the public interest, including in terms of the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The Districts referred to form part of the Limerick Division and I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 31 August the latest date for which figures are readily available the strength of the Limerick Division was 553.  There are also  31 Garda Reserves and 49 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 39 of whom have been assigned to the Limerick Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

For the most part, this Regulation's rules are directly applicable and do not, therefore, require transposition into national law in the forthcoming Data Protection Bill.    </p>  <p>  With regard to the "right to be forgotten" (i.e. right to erasure of personal data), Article 17 provides for the right to have personal data erased where the data are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed. It also applies where an individual data subject withdraws his or her consent to the processing of the data, and where the data subject objects to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest to justify continuation of the processing. </p>  <p>  As regards children, the right additionally applies where the personal data are processed in the context of internet services. Recital 65 of the Regulation underlines the importance of the "right to be forgotten" where consent to processing was given when the data subject was a child and not, therefore, fully aware of the risks involved and later wants to remove such personal data, especially on the internet. As already stated, Article 17 is directly applicable and does not require transposition in the Data Protection Bill.</p>  <p>  Article 8(1) of the Regulation provides, in the case of information society services offered directly to a child, that the processing of the child's personal data shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent of the child's parent or guardian has been obtained; the applicable age threshold is 16 years or an age not below 13 years determined by national law. Article 8(2) imposes an obligation on the providers of information society services to children to make reasonable efforts to verify that the necessary consent is given, taking into consideration available technology. </p>  <p>  In June last, following completion of consultation processes by my Department and the Government's Data Forum, the Government approved a "digital age of consent" threshold of 13 years for inclusion in the Data Protection Bill.</p>  <p>  Supervision and enforcement of the Regulation's provisions in relation to children will be a matter for the independent Data Protection Commissioner.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-24a.503.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102400072#WRO02900"><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State.  Of these, 2,622 are by means of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece.  A further 1,040 are to be sourced under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon, and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.  Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time limited.   </p>  <p>  Under the resettlement strand of the Programme, 357 persons arrived in Ireland during 2016.  Taken together with the previous year's intake, Ireland had taken in 519 of its original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016, a year ahead of schedule.  Last year, the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the total to have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 785.  The remaining 255 persons to arrive under resettlement have been selected and assessed and are expected to arrive in early 2018 together with an additional 15 persons, composed of new born babies and additional family members, giving a total of 270.   </p>  <p>  In terms of the relocation aspect of the IRPP, allocations under the relevant EU Council Decisions are composed of three elements:   </p>  <p>  - an intake from Greece of 1,089 asylum seekers  </p>  <p>  - an intake from Italy of 623 asylum seekers and </p>  <p>  - an allocation of 910 asylum seekers which has not yet been assigned to either Italy or Greece. </p>  <p>  Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.  621 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State.  Of these, 381 arrived during 2016.  A further 390 have been assessed and are awaiting travel to Ireland.  All will arrive in 2017 or early 2018. </p>  <p>  However, Italy, unlike Greece, did  not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory. Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments in Italy of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.  It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy despite the most intensive efforts by Ireland to resolve the impasse, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level.</p>  <p>  In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to  910 persons,  Ireland could not access this component until a decision was taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.  Given that it is now clear the numbers of persons covered by the two  Relocation Decisions do not actually exist on the ground in Greece or Italy, it is not foreseen that this number will ever be available to Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland has worked actively to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions. But the relocation instruments are unlikely to deliver the numbers allocated to Ireland  for the reasons set out above.  In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Ireland has made every possible effort to meet its commitments, that the commitment by Ireland to accept 4,000 persons remains and that Ireland will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for resettlement of programme refugees.  This process is already underway and on 15 September 2017 a new pledge was made to the European Commission to take a further 345 programme refugees in 2018. We are also examining other options to ensure that Ireland delivers on its commitments and expect to make an announcement in the very near future.</p></reply>

There are no date related limitations in the Acts. Under the 1987 Act any monument that is earlier than 1700AD is automatically deemed an historic monument and thus eligible for inclusion in the Register of Historic Monuments.  For later structures, I can, as Minister, form a view that they are also historic monuments and thus entitled to the same protections. </p>  <p>  New monuments legislation is currently being drafted which will allow for the establishment of a Register of Monuments.

It identifies the activities that can be performed in smaller, or Model 2, hospitals in a safe and sustainable manner, including extended day surgery, selected acute medicine, a local injuries service, a large range of diagnostic services, specialist rehabilitation medicine and palliative care.  In developing our smaller hospitals, as set out in the Smaller Hospitals Framework the first and over-riding concern is the safety of patients.  Through continued progress in the implementation of Hospital Groups, hospitals are starting to work together to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care and ensuring that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.  The Smaller Hospitals Framework focused in particular on nine hospitals. </p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise Hospital which takes account of the need to develop services at Portlaoise in the context of developing the model of service provision for the entire Hospital Group.  The draft plan has been submitted to my Department and, as with all draft plans or reports, it is now under detailed consideration.  Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, there will be further engagement with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the final report of the Trauma Steering Group is under consideration in my Department, given that Emergency Departments are one of the elements in a trauma care pathway that goes from prevention through to rehabilitation and the report considers their services in that context.  However, it is important to be clear that major trauma patients represent only a very small proportion of total Emergency Department activity and, having regard to past media reports on trauma services, that the report is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services.</p></reply>

The health sector has a highly mobile workforce and free movement issues and the mutual recognition and assurance of professional qualifications are being considered. </p>  <p>  These issues are currently being examined by my Department and its agencies and this work will continue over the period ahead.  The key priorities for my Department are to ensure continuity in the provision of health services and provision of health services and to avoid, or mitigate against, changes to the current situation that would have a negative impact on human health.  These are also key factors in considering the prioritisation of risks.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to work closely with  the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other departments on Brexit, and to work and contribute as required to the cross Governmental response, including on the themes identified, in light of the ongoing cross-Government research, analysis and consultations with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions is under way.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. </p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government states that the Government wishes to provide more accessible respite care to facilitate full support for people with a disability. </p><p>The Health Service Executive, HSE,  report &ldquo;<i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo;,</i>(2011) proposes a new model of support in the community by moving people from institutional settings to the community.  The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  The needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person-centred plan. </p><p>At the end of December 2016, fewer than 2,600 people with a disability were living in congregated settings.  The HSE's 2017 National Service Plan has set a target of 223 to move from institutions in 2017.  This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.  I must emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, </i>and the Deputy's questions relate to service matters, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

One of the key findings of the Review was that there was no difference in breastfeeding rates in hospitals that had achieved the Baby Friendly designation, and those that hadn&rsquo;t achieved designation. In fact, while the Initiative has been in place for 20 years, only 9 of the 19 maternity hospitals have achieved the Baby Friendly designation. This Review highlighted the need for a revised model of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. </p><p>Following completion of the Review, the HSE initiated engagement with The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and other stakeholders on developing a revised model. While the HSE has made the decision to pause the existing initiative and it is not being funded for 2017. </p><p>The HSE are currently progressing the development of a revised model, working with the National Women and Infants Programme, the HSE Health and Wellbeing Division, the HSE Lead Midwife and other key stakeholders. The revised model will continue to support the implementation of the WHO/UNICEF 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, which is the basis of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. The revised model is expected by the end of the year and will be rolled out in 2018.</p><p>A wide range of other actions are underway in implementing the HSE National Breastfeeding Action Plan 2016-2020. These include: </p><p>-  Improved Governance and health service structures; </p><p>-  Breastfeeding training and skills development; </p><p>-  Health service policies and practices;</p><p>-  Support at all stages of the breastfeeding continuum; and </p><p>-  Research, monitoring and evaluation. </p><p>Details of specific actions can be seen in the HSE National Breastfeeding Action Plan 2016-2020 on the HSE website breastfeeding.ie and here is the link</p><p><i>www.breastfeeding.ie/Uploads/breastfeeding-in-a-healthy-ireland.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the OPIOG held its inaugural meeting on the 19 of October last with further meetings to be arranged at agreed intervals for the purposes of providing oversight to the implementation of the national Obesity Policy &amp;amp; Action Plan (OPAP).</p>  <p>  At its inaugural meeting, the OPOIG agreed to establish two sub-groups for Reformulation and Healthy Eating. Further sub-groups will be established as required. Both sub-groups have agreed to meet and agree their draft Terms of Reference, which in the interim, remain under active consideration in the Department. The work of the Reformulation sub-group - including work on methodology for measuring the efficacy of the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax - is therefore at an early stage. I expect that the elaboration of such methodologies will evolve over the course of this work.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the OPIOG will identify processes for engaging with networks of stakeholders, including health organisations. The OPIOG will therefore elaborate on this aspect of its functions over the course of its work to implement the OPAP that runs up to 2025.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p><p>Under the primary legislation an NHSS applicant may apply for certain items of expenditure to be taken into account and netted off against their means prior to the calculation of their contribution. These items are referred to as allowable deductions. Under the law, private health insurance is not classed as an allowable deduction.  An applicant can apply for the following to be deducted:</p><p>-  Health Expenses such a doctors' fees, pharmacy costs and prescription charges; </p><p>-  Interest on loans related to the applicants principal primary residence; </p><p>-  Rent Payments; and</p><p>-  Property Tax. </p><p>When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Review has concluded and a Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.  An International/Agency Working Group has been established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the Review. Work in this regard is currently underway.</p></reply>

These centres will provide services and environments of the same quality as those delivered in the main hospital, with staff rotating through the outpatient and urgent care centres and the main hospital.  The availability of consultant-led urgent care, with 4-6 hour observation beds and appropriate diagnostics will mean that families can avail of a range of services locally and this will reduce the need to attend the Emergency Department and OPD clinics at the main site.  The site at Tallaght is easily accessible to large population areas with young families who will benefit from access to such paediatric services locally.  Each Paediatric centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care and 15,000 outpatient attendances every year. </p>  <p>  The centres will be open during the known busiest daytime and evening hours and closed during the night when departments are at their quietest.  It is anticipated that the Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Centres at Tallaght and Connolly will open from 08:00 to 24:00, diagnostic services from 08.00 to 20.00 and outpatient services from 08:00 to 18:00.  The construction of the Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght  is scheduled to be completed in 2020  in advance of the main hospital opening in 2022.</p></reply>

This includes which hospitals are covered under which plans.</p>  <p>  If an individual wishes to upgrade their cover and to use a benefit on the new plan which is higher than the benefit provided on the old plan, they may have to serve an upgrade waiting period before full cover for this benefit is available.  The maximum waiting period that may be applied to any higher benefit on a new plan is 2 years.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 1970 provides that all persons ordinarily resident in the country are eligible, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services.  Persons can opt to be treated privately on admission to a public hospital, in which case they are liable for the consultants fees and hospital charges arising for that episode of care, whether paid for by the patient or by a health insurer on their behalf.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of public funding and AHR treatment, I intend to revert to Government by the end of this year with proposals for a potential model of public funding for AHR treatment for the Government's consideration and decision.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the Health Research Board's (HRB) evidence review of international public funding models for AHR was published earlier this year.  This evidence review examines the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  An analysis of the HRB evidence review will feed into the development of policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment by my officials.  This policy options paper will be presented to me by the end of this year and I will then submit these proposals to Government.  It is important to note that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill.</p>  <p>  While IVF treatment is not currently provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

Investigations must be commenced within 48 hours of the organisation becoming aware of the incident and completed within four months of commencement.  In addition, from now on, all maternal deaths will be subject to a review which is external to the Maternity Network/Hospital Group.  I understand that maternal deaths are also reported to the Coroner as a 'rule of practice'.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that it can be difficult to make international comparisons in relation to maternal mortality because data collection systems vary.  However, in an effort to improve the accuracy of our information on maternal deaths in Ireland, a Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) system was established in 2009, linking Ireland to the United Kingdom's Confidential MDE which is considered the gold standard for maternal death enquiries.  </p>  <p>  With regard to MDE Ireland, the information it collects includes maternal age and ethnicity/nationality, body mass index and smoking status.  The Deputy will be aware that the statistics reported to MDE Ireland require anonymisation due to the small number of such incidents occurring across the country's maternity hospitals/units.  Thus, naming the hospitals/units where such events have occurred would not meet the data protection standards required for protection of otherwise identifiable patient information (Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, Section 5(h)); such statistics are not, therefore, publicly available.  Submitting information to MBRRACE-UK allows Ireland to participate in reporting on maternal deaths while keeping anonymity in place. </p>  <p>  According to MDE Ireland, 38.7% of maternal deaths 2009-2012 (including direct and indirect causes) occurred in women born outside Ireland, who represented 24.2% of all maternities in Ireland for that time period.  This finding reflects those from successive UK MBRRACE reports which have found an increased risk of maternal deaths among migrant ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the Government's commitment to the progressive development of maternity services in Ireland.  2016 saw the publication of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy, the HSE&rsquo;s National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death and HIQA&rsquo;s National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services.  In addition, each of our maternity hospitals/units is now publishing monthly Maternity Patient Safety Statements.  In January 2017, the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme was established to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services with the HSE, which includes ensuring that learning is disseminated to all hospitals/units.  I have recently launched the Programme's Implementation Plan for the Strategy.  All these developments represent key building blocks to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality maternity service, including for women born outside of the State.</p></reply>

The figures published at the time by these interested groups who were investigating the possibility of building a new facility indicated that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million depending on what type of facility would be constructed.  Both groups were informed that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility in Ireland would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a sufficiently robust business case in order to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;.  It is now a matter for any interested parties to move a project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.  The possible location of any proposed new facility is a matter for the parties concerned.</p></reply>

That is entirely a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to decide upon. </p>  <p>  That said, many of these designations are for species or habitats whose conservation is encouraged under various schemes operated by my Department, such as GLAS, the Burren Programme or some of the newer locally led schemes being rolled out at present.  This is the case for the Hen Harrier where affected farmers can attract payments of up to &euro;7,000 per annum under GLAS.  The new Locally Led Hen Harrier Programme will also reward participating farmers working to save this endangered bird. </p>  <p>  However, all such schemes operated by my Department are aimed at active farmers and therefore the landowner mentioned in this case is not, unfortunately, eligible or indeed equipped to participate in the type of conservation work envisaged.</p></reply>

The station is owned by the ESB and the White Paper recognises that key decisions on its future will have to be taken before 2020 as the station will reach the end of its operating life in its current configuration in 2025.</p>  <p>  In addition, the White Paper recognises that increasing &lsquo;cost of carbon&rsquo; charges on Green House Gas emissions will drive up the cost of carbon-intensive energy sources and lead firms and consumers to adopt low carbon fuels and energy efficient technologies.  It is anticipated therefore that the phasing out of higher carbon fuels will be achieved by a combination of sustainable policy measures and consumer reaction to the higher price of carbon intensive fuels.</p>  <p>  The future of Moneypoint is multifaceted and requires consideration of issues such as security of supply, system stability, competitiveness and sustainability.  My Department is examining the key considerations in relation to the future of Moneypoint, including the overall fuel mix in the energy sector, analysis undertaken to date in relation to Moneypoint, and appropriate further research if considered necessary.</p></reply>

This includes funding of c. &euro;230 million for mainline rail and DART capacity enhancement.  This will enable acceleration of the initial stages of the DART Expansion programme, focussing on additional fleet and extending the electrified DART system.  It will allow further progress to be made on the electrification of both the Northern rail line to Balbriggan and the Maynooth line.  </p>  <p>  In light of the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s (NTA) responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NTA for further information on the issues raised.

Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy.  The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.  </p>  <p>  The Strategy does not include the implementation of the Leinster Outer Orbital during its lifetime.  </p>  <p>  Following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan, Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021.  The increased funding will allow roll-out of a number of key programmes to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system across our cities including an investment of over &euro;400 million next year.  </p>  <p>  This substantial multi-annual envelope will allow investment in a number of key programmes to ease congestion and increase capacity on our public transport network.  This includes funding of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to fundamentally transform Dublin&rsquo;s bus system, so that journeys for bus passengers will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.  </p>  <p>  Over &euro;685 million capital investment will also be provided for additional rail infrastructure between now and 2021 to provide additional Luas capacity, improve mainline rail infrastructure and progress DART expansion and new Metro North.</p></reply>

My Department published the National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland in May to support the deployment of alternative fuels for transport in Ireland and assist in removing any barriers that exist towards greater uptake of low emissions vehicles (LEVs).</p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Green Public Transport Fund to support the uptake of low carbon technologies within the public transport sector.  The fund will support pilot demonstrations of emerging low emission technologies, particularly for buses.</p>  <p>  In suitable urban areas I am committed to meeting increasing travel demand through enhanced public transport capacity and encouraging more &lsquo;active travel&rsquo; journeys &ndash; cycling and walking &ndash; and, within the context of the Government's budgetary policy and competing expenditure needs, I am working to be able to invest more in such infrastructure and services over time. </p>  <p>  Outside urban areas - where dependence on private car travel is strongest and where systems of public transport and active travel offer less realistic potential to addressing travel needs effectively and efficiently - a different response is needed, and here alternative fuels and technologies currently offer the most feasible and cost-effective solution.</p>  <p>  Decarbonising transport will require a significant step-change in how we travel but it is clear that a movement towards more sustainable technologies in the public transport fleet has already begun.  In the Greater Dublin Area, the Bus Connects program includes a commitment to transition towards a new bus fleet using low-emission vehicle technologies.  It is anticipated that by 2023, half of the bus fleet (approximately 500 buses) will be converted to low-emission vehicles, with plans for full conversion by 2030.</p>  <p>  The data sought by the Deputy is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the companies for direct reply.

However Councils are requested to prioritise projects which involve strengthening works, remedying road defects, winter maintenance and drainage works.</p><p><b>Bridge Rehabilitation (BR): </b>This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake bridge rehabilitation works. </p><p><b>Safety Improvement Works (BS)</b>: This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake safety improvement works. </p><p><b>Training Grant (TG): </b>The Training Grant assists in the provision of training of persons engaged in maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads.  </p><p><b>Specific Grant and Strategic Grants:</b>The Department no longer seeks annual applications from local authorities in respect of the Specific (road improvement schemes costing up to &euro;5m.) and Strategic (improvement schemes costing over &euro;5m.) grant programmes.

The RSA will engage with affected stakeholders to provide them with guidance in relation to the practical implementation of its requirements.</p>  <p>  The penalties for failure to have a certificate of roadworthiness when using a commercial vehicle on the public road are set out in the RSA (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012, and are enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) have commenced preparatory work on the planning and design of new Metro North and a dedicated project Steering Group has been established which is meeting on a regular basis.  The NTA, in collaboration with TII, is undertaking an option analysis and selection study of possible metro alignments and station locations.  Arising from this work a final route and station configuration will be established.

On Sunday the 15th of October at 19.41, an announcement regarding the closure of childcare facilities was released on the PIP Portal.  The PIP Portal is an IT system that enables communication with all 4500 services funded by DCYA.  Operated by Pobal, DCYAs funding and administration intermediary, PIP is used for all important communications with childcare service providers. This announcement was based on the advice of the National Emergency Coordinating Group.</p>  <p>  It advised that childcare providers should make safety their priority when deciding whether or not to open during the storm, but that if they chose to close my Department would ensure that the funding the providers would receive in the normal course would continue to be provided.</p>  <p>A press release was also issued and shared with key stakeholders who could further share on social media and other platforms.  This information was also included in the statement released from the National Emergency Coordinating Group on Sunday the 15th   of October. The relevant section from this statement is as follows: "Because of the duty of care owed to children and to avoid the risk arising from travelling, the Department of Education and Skills is instructing all schools to act on the Department's advice and remain closed. Cr&egrave;ches and Montessori facilities should also remain closed tomorrow."</p>  <p>  As childcare facilities are independent, privately managed and governed entities it is not possible to issue a directive.  My Department and the National Emergency Coordinating Group advised as appropriate and I ensured that where services closed they would not see any loss of public funding.</p>  <p>  My Department again took steps to ensure that the same option remained open to providers on Tuesday when schools were closed.  This was to facilitate the appropriate safety checks by the cr&egrave;che owners.  It was a matter for the service providers themselves to decide, but again I ensured their funding would still be available.  As these childcare services range from very small to more substantial buildings, these checks would not in all instances be as onerous as a very large building like a school.  Local decisions were required.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that our advice and support was measured, appropriate and proportionate.</p></reply>

In 2017, for example, a total of &euro;8.4 million was allocated in Early Years Capital funding to create new childcare places as well as increasing the quality of childcare facilities.  This funding was allocated in a competitive application process of which 683 providers nationwide received funding.  An appeals process for the 2017 Early Years Capital Programme was operated by Pobal where unsuccessful applicants could request to have the decision on their original application reconsidered.  These decisions are currently being communicated to individual providers. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular case you reference, following an appeals process the original decision was upheld and this decision is final.  </p>  <p>I have secured &euro;6.86 million in Capital funding that will be made available in 2018 across Early Years Capital and School Age Capital Programmes.

Currently there are three different points in the year - September, January and April.</p>  <p>  Under Budget 2018, the ECCE programme has been expanded further so that all eligible children can avail of a full two programme year.  There will also only be one enrolment point each year (i.e September). However, I must advise the Deputy that these will not come into effect until September 2018. </p>  <p>  An upper age limit in free pre-school was set by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment on the advice of the Department of Education and Skills.  Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs does its best to ensure, in so far as is possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner.  The rules for all the Department&rsquo;s childcare schemes are clearly published to ensure transparency and consistent application.  An essential component of the scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  For the programme year 2017/2018 parents may request an  exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria under limited circumstances from my Department; specifically where a diagnosed special and/or medical need exists.  This must be supported by a letter from a relevant medical specialist, recommending additional time in pre-school.  However, please be aware that my Department is currently reviewing the overage exemption process.  I would urge the parents of the child in question to contact my Department to enquire about such an exemption.</p></reply>

This represents a 2.1% increase (at a minimum), and builds on a similar &euro;5 weekly rate increase in Budget 2017, and a &euro;3 increase in the weekly rates of pension payments in Budget 2016.</p><p>In recent year therefore social welfare rates have increased in excess of prices and increases in average earnings.</p><p>Any system of indexing welfare rates would have to take account of not just the need to preserve value but also whether this value should be preserved in relative terms (compared to incomes in the economy generally) or in purchasing value terms (indexed to prices). </p><p>In this regard the recently published <i>Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund </i>considers the impact of indexation of the State Pension Contributory (SPC) on the Social Insurance Fund. It finds that indexation of SPC in line with the Consumer Price Index would be likely to result in projected expenditure of the Fund broadly equalling projected Fund receipts in the projection period (up to 2071).  However it also finds that indexation of SPC in line with average earnings growth would be likely to result in a substantial and increasing shortfall in the Fund from 2020 onwards &ndash; amounting over time to over &euro;400Bn. </p><p>These data indicate that the selection of an indexing approach could result in widely varying levels of payment dependent on the approach taken and also that the selection of an indexation approach  would also have to have regard to the affordability and sustainability of the welfare system taking into account other demands on the public purse.</p><p>In addition any system of indexation would need to take account of the need to make structural changes from time to time in order to respond to emerging challenges and  to improve equity within the system.</p><p>For these reasons the approach in Ireland has, until now,  been to set welfare rates on an annual basis in the context of wider budgetary and economic policy.  </p><p>Nevertheless I do believe that there may be merit in indexing rates as is done in some other countries  and intend to consider the matter further in coming months.</p></reply>

One response to this situation is a new pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities, called the Ability programme, which was launched in September. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Ability programme is to bring young people with disabilities who are not work-ready closer to the labour market.  The programme will promote employment prospects and meaningful social roles for young people with disabilities and in particular, young people who are distant from the labour market using a range of person-centred supports.  The focus of the programme will be on projects aimed at young people with disabilities (aged 15 &ndash; 29) designed to assist in their transition from school to further education and employment.</p>  <p>  The funding for this programme will amount to some &euro;10 million over a three year period and is co-funded by the Irish Exchequer and the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning operational programme, 2014-2020 (PEIL, 2014 &ndash; 20).  At the launch of the programme, national, regional and local organisations that have experience of working with people with a disability were invited to submit proposals for funding to Pobal, who are the administrative agents of the programme for the Department.  The minimum grant that can be applied for will be for &euro;200,000, while the maximum grant will be for &euro;750,000 over the funding period.  Organisations, such as the one for which the Deputy provided details of, can submit an application for funding, either in their own right or as a part of a consortium, through Pobal&rsquo;s website between the 4th December 2017 and 31st January 2018.  Organisations will also be able to register on the Pobal website to attend information events about the application process, two of which are to be held in Dublin tomorrow.  Following the closing date for applications in January, Pobal will appraise the applications and successful applicants will be notified by April 2018.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Referral to JobPath is by random selection and is generally for a 52-week period.  Jobseekers who are already participating with the JobPath service will not be referred to T&uacute;s as they can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time.  This allows the scheme and service providers sufficient time to work with the participants in order to develop their skills and competencies to pursue suitable job opportunities which may result in sustainable employment and also to ensure that the best use is made of the available places on all activation supports.</p>  <p>  Where a Jobseeker has been referred to the JobPath programme, placement on CE, T&uacute;s or Gateway will only be permitted if there is written confirmation of an offer that predates the JobPath referral date and an agreed start date on the work scheme within four weeks of the JobPath referral date.  </p>  <p>The person concerned was referred to the JobPath programme on 12 August 2017; was subsequently offered a place on the Tipperary Leader Partnership T&uacute;s programme on 23 August 2017 with a confirmed start date of 18 September 2017.  As this offer did not pre-date the JobPath referral and the start date was not within four weeks of the referral, the offer does not meet the specific criteria required to allow them to take up this placement.  </p>  <p>  While T&uacute;s schemes provide long-term unemployed people with part-time experience as a stepping stone back to employment, they are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Participation on a T&uacute;s scheme remains an option for Jobseekers if they continue to be unemployed at the end of their engagement with the JobPath service.  </p>  <p>  Participants with JobPath receive intensive individual support to help overcome barriers to employment and to find jobs.  Each person is assigned a personal advisor who assesses their skills, experience, challenges and work goals and agrees a &ldquo;personal progression plan&rdquo; that includes a schedule of activities, including relevant training and educational programmes to assist them in finding full-time sustainable employment.  There are no barriers to any participants pursuing training, including further education and training courses, providing they are relevant to the agreed personal progression plan.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the person concerned will derive benefit from participation and would encourage them to continue to engage with the JobPath service to ensure progress on their journey back to full time employment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters.</p></reply>

First, that it should ensure that work pays, and second, that it should have a positive effect on reducing child poverty.  To advance the commitment contained in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Department established an internal working group and an Inter-Departmental Group of the relevant Government Departments to consider proposals.  </p>  <p>  As part of this process the Department carried out an extensive analysis of its existing range of supports that are aimed at assisting individuals to take up employment.  The analysis showed the existing in-work supports are very effective, and work well in assisting individuals make the transition from unemployment into employment.  </p>  <p>  These findings are confirmed by the ESRI&rsquo;s research into the Department&rsquo;s existing in-work measures, and Eurostat figures, which show that the parental in-work poverty rate in Ireland, at 5.8%, is significantly below the EU 28 average of 11.2%.  This is in large part due to the Department&rsquo;s in-work supports such as Family Income Supplement and the Back to Work Family Dividend.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the analysis carried out by the working group did not support the need for the establishment of a new scheme.  In the context of Budget 2018 it was decided to re-designate the FIS scheme as the Working Family Payment, which will bring it more visibility as a payment aimed specifically at working families.  The new name better reflects the nature of the payment and the Department would encourage families to look into seeing if they are eligible for the payment.  </p>  <p>  Given all of the above there are no plans to change the qualification criteria around the Working Family Payment.</p></reply>

The programme aims to provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  </p>  <p>  YESS will be open to people aged between 18 and 24 who have been out of work and in receipt of a qualifying payment for at least 12 months or, if unemployed for less than 12 months, are considered by a case worker to face a significant barrier to work.  </p>  <p>  Candidates must be in receipt of one of the following qualifying payments: Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit, One Parent Family Payment, Jobseeker Transition Payment, Disability Allowance, Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension, Supplementary Welfare Allowance; or signing for Credits.</p>  <p>  Although people will be encouraged and supported to avail of suitable placements, participation on YESS will be entirely voluntary &ndash; there will be no financial penalties for jobseekers who do not wish to participate or who do not complete a placement.  </p>  <p>  There will be clear eligibility requirements for Host Organisations wishing to participate in the programme.  They will be required to sign up to Terms and Conditions when they advertise a placement.  </p>  <p>The standard duration of the work experience programme will be three months, with an option to extend the placement further to six or nine months following a review of progress by a Departmental case worker.  The attendance requirement will be 30 hours per week.  Participants will receive a weekly payment equivalent to the net minimum wage which represents a very significant increase on their underlying payment.  </p>  <p>  A designated case worker will liaise with the participant and the Host Organisation throughout the period of the placement, to monitor how well it is progressing for both parties and to provide appropriate advice and support.  </p>  <p>  Clearly defined learning and development outcomes for each placement will be identified, with a focus on &lsquo;soft&rsquo; (employability) skills as well as any specific &lsquo;hard&rsquo; skills that will be acquired and/or demonstrated during the placement.

I welcome a number of positive findings in the Review:</p>  <p>  - The policy changes introduced have been successful in increasing employment and in reducing welfare dependency &ndash; the reforms increased the probability of both employment and of higher employment income.</p>  <p>  - Responses to the survey showed that the percentage of lone parents in full-time employment increased from 15% to 22%.</p>  <p>  - Welfare dependency rates fell in the year after One-parent Family Payment was lost, and continued to fall in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  I believe these findings indicate the broad policy intentions of the changes are having positive results and making real changes to the lives of lone parents, where they have been able to transition into employment.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge, however, that the review has also raised a number of matters of concern:</p>  <p>  - Many of those who lost the One-parent Family Payment remain unemployed, or are in low paid or part-time employment,</p>  <p>  - The balance of evidence indicates that there is an increased probability of being at risk of poverty as a result of the changes,</p>  <p>  - Further supports, aimed at assisting lone parents to obtain full-time employment or increased hours of work, need to be put in place.  </p>  <p>  The impacts on lone parents arose from the combination of the policy changes to the scheme, and from the imposition, simultaneously, of the financial cuts imposed to welfare schemes across the board, arising out of the economic downturn.  I, and my predecessors, have already taken action in recent Budgets to improve the position of lone parents, for example by progressively increasing the income disregard for those on Jobseeker's Transition (JST) from a low of &euro;60 a week to &euro;110 euro a week, and by targeting improved, tailored activation measures towards this group, to assist them into training and employment.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 builds further on recent Budgets and the following measures will specifically benefit lone parents:</p>  <p>- Income disregard for parents getting OFP and JST to be increased from &euro;110 a week to &euro;130 a week with effect from 29 March 2018;</p>  <p>- The Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) rate to be increased from &euro;29.80 a week to &euro;31.80 a week with effect from 29 March 2018;</p>  <p>  A number of other budgetary measures will also benefit lone parents, including the &euro;5 rate increase, the additional week to the fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus of 85% to be paid in early December.</p>  <p>  On foot of the measures for lone parents contained in Budget 2018, a lone parent on OFP or the JST working 15 hours at the national minimum wage will see an increase in their overall income of over &euro;19 per week (or &euro;1,000 per annum) from approximately &euro;347 in 2017 to &euro;366 in 2018.  </p>  <p>  A lone parent on OFP working 15 hours at the national minimum wage will see an increase in their overall income of &euro;19 per week (or &euro;1,000 per annum), or approximately 5 to 5.5%, based on a combination of the increase in the National Minimum Wage, the increase to the income disregards on OFP and JST, the rate increase of &euro;5 per week and the IQC increase of &euro;2 a week.  </p>  <p>  Lone parents who choose to participate in education can continue to receive support from the Department either through the retention of their primary payment or Family Income Supplement or they can transfer to the Back to Education Allowance.  Furthermore, to support lone parents participate in education, SUSI grants (both maintenance and fee grants) are payable concurrently with One-parent Family Payment and Jobseeker's Transition.  Therefore a lone parent can participate in education and receive the dual support of the One-parent Family Payment or Jobseeker's Transition and the SUSI maintenance grants.  Where the lone parent is on Jobseeker's Allowance they can, should they wish to participate in education, transfer to the Back to Education programme.  </p>  <p>  The additional childcare supports coming on-stream will also be of particular benefit to lone parents.</p>  <p>  I consider that these measures are a step in the right direction, and I am working to ensure that there is no loss in the momentum to enhance the support for lone parents.  The Review points to the need to intensify both the engagement with lone parents as they move off One-parent Family Payment, and the activation supports available, and I have requested my officials to prioritise this.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s employment services provide a case-managed approach to assist lone parents to avail of various opportunities within an ever-improving labour market.  This case-managed approach will be developed further, specifically to offer more tailored and holistic progression plans for lone parents that better reflect their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  The move to more tailored progressions plans for lone parents will incorporate supports to access the child care, education and training and other appropriate supports that they require to, in turn, access the labour market.  These changes should help to improve the living standards of, and reduce the risk of poverty faced by, lone parents.</p>  <p>  I intend to continue to prioritise supports for lone parents, particularly those which incentivise work over welfare.  I intend also to provide for the further review of the scheme.  As there is a time lag before the benefits of labour market reforms appear I anticipate that this review will include data to the end of 2018.</p></reply>

CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners, which includes 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS) and 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS).  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services, and &euro;24 million is allocated to the network of MABS services.  </p>  <p>  Successive CIB Strategic Plans have over the past number of years set out the need and intention of the Board to change structures and processes to enable more efficient use of resources, which are entirely publicly funded.  </p>  <p>  There is no inconsistency or conflict between information provided in the House by me and to the Committee of Public Accounts by the former Secretary General of the Department.  The decision by the Board of CIB to restructure its delivery partners was done in three phases.  The first phase was when the Board decided in late 2014 that change was needed in the structure of delivery partner companies.  It did not, at that time, decide on the precise new structure.  Rather, it agreed that a Design Group be tasked with presenting options on new organisational models for its consideration.  When the former Secretary General met with the Committee of Public Accounts in May 2015, she advised it that the streamlining of governance arrangements was firmly on the agenda of the Board of CIB; that work was underway on identifying a new governance model; that options were identified in the Pathfinder report; and that more work needed to be done before a decision on the new structure would be made by the Board.  The second phase was when the Board of CIB decided in October 2016, following the work of the Design Group, to proceed to restructure its governance arrangements on a regional model basis.  Finally, the third phase was in February of this year when the Board decided that the regional company model should comprise 16 companies across eight regions, comprising eight CIS companies and eight MABS companies.  </p>  <p>  My Department was informed of incremental progression of the CIB process at relevant stages, but did not participate in the Board&rsquo;s deliberative process of selecting its preferred corporate governance model for CIS and MABS networks.  </p>  <p>  As a statutory body, the Board has the sole right to make decisions on its day to day operations as it sees fit.  The decision taken by the Board of CIB comes after a lengthy period of consultation and detailed consideration of options and views put forward at all stages.  </p>  <p>  The membership of the Board of CIB, which comprises experienced and competent individuals representative of a broad spectrum of interests and which includes representatives of the Citizens Information Service and Money Advice and Budgeting Service, has made this decision in the best interests of the citizens, whom the Board serves.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Claimants (and if applicable, their adult dependant) must sign off their primary social welfare payment and will then receive a weekly payment for up to 2 years.

The conditions include progressing in the level of education held by the client, with reference to the national framework of qualifications.  </p>  <p>  Applicants holding a qualification at tertiary education level (certificate, diploma, primary degree or post graduate qualification) are not approved under the BTEA to pursue a course at a similar or lower qualification level.  However, there are a small number of situations where the progression rule is not applied.  For instance, where a person holds a Level 5 or Level 6, the progression rule can be waived if their previous qualification was obtained three years prior to re-entry into education.  The course must also be deemed to enhance a person&rsquo;s job prospects and the participant must satisfy all other eligibility criteria.  This does not apply to someone educated to a level 7 qualification.</p>  <p>  The person to whom the Deputy refers already holds a qualification at QQ1 level 7.  Her application for the BTEA relates to a level 5 course of study and was refused by her local Intreo Centre, in accordance with the BTEA guidelines.  </p>  <p>  Overall, it is important to note that the purpose of the BTEA is to raise educational and skill levels so as to improve a welfare recipient&rsquo;s employment prospects.  Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to BTEA. State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government recently approved the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, which, consistent with the recommendations of report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, primarily involve, <i>inter alia</i>, all State funding to Irish Water in respect of domestic water services as determined through the regulatory process being channeled in future through my Department's Vote.  The future funding of Irish Water in respect of domestic water services will therefore be from general taxation, in the form of a payment for domestic water services, based on the purchase of water covering the entirety of domestic water consumption other than excessive use and a contribution to replace the financing of the domestic component of capital investment previously funded by debt and a capital contribution from Central Funds.</p><p>A current funding provision of &euro;114m for the revenue shortfall from the suspension/abolition of domestic water charges is being provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2018 as part of the Abridged Estimates process with the balance already reflected in the subvention provided through the Local Government Fund (some &euro;239m is required on an annual basis to meet the abolition of water charges).  The overall funding of Irish Water in 2018 in respect of domestic water services is being finalised as part of the consequential reform of the Local Government Fund and the Revised Estimates process.  In overall terms, some &euro;1.1 billion will be required by Irish Water to meet the cost of domestic water services in 2018, of which &euro;500m relates to capital investment, the latter representing the major component of the overall planned capital investment of over &euro;600m in cash terms by Irish Water in 2018. </p></reply>

The new arrangements arising from this process are being tested to ensure that there is no negative impact arising from how they are viewed and treated in respect of the State&rsquo;s General Government Balance.  As part of this process, the proposed changes have been examined by Eurostat.  Work on the scheme is well advanced, with details expected to be announced in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness emphasises the need to look at new ways of funding social housing delivery, in particular the need to provide structural, funding and policy supports to increase delivery of social housing by Approved Housing Bodies.  In that context, it provides for support to be made available to an Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH)/sector-led new special purpose vehicle, involving investors which could potentially include the credit union movement.</p>  <p>  In May 2017, my Department announced funding of &euro;49,000 for the ICSH to support this initiative, with the aim of establishing a sector-led financial vehicle to allow AHBs to expand and to facilitate the delivery of additional housing units.  Ultimately, the funding structure required to facilitate credit union involvement in the financing of social housing will have a neutral impact on General Government Debt, or be &ldquo;off balance sheet&rdquo; using the more commonly applied term.</p>  <p>  The mechanisms to be used in the deployment of investment funds will have to be agreed by credit unions, with the support of their members and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  My Department remains available to provide any necessary technical advice and support.</p></reply>

These custom-developed facilities, referred to as family hubs, offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, with the capacity to provide appropriate play-space, cooking and laundry facilities, communal recreation space, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services and appropriate family supports.</p>  <p>  Additional support services for families in emergency accommodation are available through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  These include a special provision under the existing Community Childcare Subvention Programme of free childcare for children from homeless families; a special emphasis being placed on children from homeless families through the School Completion Programme; schools with Home School Community Liaison Coordinators are proactively engaging with the parents from homeless families to assist access to any other supports that may be of assistance; and children in homeless accommodation are being prioritised within the School Completion Programme for services such as breakfast and homework clubs.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 28,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments.</p>  <p>  Recognising the pressures in the rental market, the Government increased the maximum rent limits available under the HAP scheme across the country with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The increased rent limits introduced by the Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  On average in 2017, 348 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week.  Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork City regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP.  I recently confirmed that the Place Finder Service available in these local authorities will be rolled out to all other local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided &euro;152.7 million to fund the cost of HAP in 2017 and I am satisfied that this is sufficient to meet the targeted level of activity this year.  Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.  From available data, at the end of Q2 2017, and excluding the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region, 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefiting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits.</p>  <p>  The data available to my Department at this time indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  I am satisfied with how the scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.  My Department will, of course, continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p></reply>

In Budget 2018, I secured &euro;1.9 billion for housing programmes next year, representing a 46% increase over 2017.  This investment will ensure that the housing needs of 25,500 households will be met next year, over 4,400 more than in 2017.</p><p>In addition to this significant increase for 2018, I also secured a further &euro;500 million for investment in social housing over the period 2019 &ndash; 2021.  This additional funding will allow for an increase in the overall level of social housing to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies by a further 3,000 homes, resulting in the overall target for social housing delivery under Rebuilding Ireland being increased from 47,000 to 50,000 homes, with the total funding investment increasing from &euro;5.35 billion to over &euro;6 billion.</p><p>As previously announced, I am placing a greater emphasis on the direct building of social housing than was originally envisaged under Rebuilding Ireland.  Therefore, in 2018 we will see some 5,000 homes built; this  includes 3,800 homes to be built by local authorities and approved housing bodies, an increase of 800 as a direct result of the reorientation towards increasing building activity overall.</p><p>With the increased focus on construction delivery, supported by the required funding, some 33,500 new social homes will be delivered through various construction programmes over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>In relation to construction activity, my Department publishes comprehensive status reports on a quarterly basis of all social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas, showing details such as their locations and a range of information relating to their advancement.  The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end of quarter 2 of 2017; it contains information on the delivery of 11,000 new social homes &ndash; currently approved and progressing through planning, design, and construction.  The report also contains details of the homes delivered in 2016 and to the end of quarter 2 of 2017.  The report can be accessed at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The level of funding provided to local authorities for their social housing construction activity is directly linked to the scale of delivery they achieve on these projects.  Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing construction programmes as speedily as possible and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p></reply>

It also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps (including the exercise of any appropriate statutory powers) to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site.  To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on sites which are included in the local authority&rsquo;s derelict sites register, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site. Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. This facilitates members of the public to engage, if they so wish, with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites. </p>  <p>  Before including a site on the register, local authorities are required to give notice to any owner and occupier of their intention to include the site on the register, and must consider any written representations that any owner or occupier may make before deciding whether to include the site on the register. Local authorities are also required to send notice of the inclusion of a site on the register to the owner and occupier of the site. </p>  <p>  I understand from Kildare County Council that the particular site in question is not included in their Derelict Sites Register.  It is open to any person to contact a local authority in relation to a particular site which may be considered a derelict site for the purposes of the Act.</p></reply>

There properties are either privately owned or owned by AHBs. Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.</p><p>AHBs have a key role to play in the provision of high quality sustainable social housing. My Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct and purchase housing units and make them available for social housing with assistance using the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF). These housing units are secured under long-term leases/ availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs, the ongoing costs of which are recouped to local authorities by my Department under SHCEP. The CALF is a facility which is exclusively available to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to assist them in accessing private or Housing Finance Agency (HFA) finance for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of units that will then be made available for social housing purposes under SHCEP. These properties will therefore be AHB owned and at the end of the Payment and Availability term it is anticipated that, given the nature of the AHB sector, the properties would remain in social housing.</p><p>The additional units funded through SHCEP in each of the years 2014 to 2016 and to date in 2017 is set out in the following table. As units are not targeted for delivery under the NTMA/ISIF delivery stream until 2018, this category is not included.<table><tr><th>Type of lease</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 (up to end Q3)</th></tr><tr><td>AHB/LA Lease (Private Owner)</td><td>626</td><td>652</td><td>574</td><td>413</td></tr><tr><td>AHB Acquired</td><td>303</td><td>349</td><td>283</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>AHB Build</td><td>16</td><td>43</td><td>283</td><td>216</td></tr><tr><td>NAMA/SPV Leases</td><td>120</td><td>433</td><td>218</td><td>258</td></tr><tr><td>Repair &amp;amp; Leasing</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,065</td><td>1,477</td><td>1,358</td><td>1,205</td></tr></table></p><p>The average length of leases of properties secured for funding under the SHCEP programme is outlined in the following table.<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Average lease length</th></tr><tr><td>AHB/LA Lease (Private Owner)</td><td>10.5 years</td></tr><tr><td>AHB Acquired</td><td>27 years</td></tr><tr><td>AHB Build</td><td>28 years</td></tr><tr><td>NAMA/SPV Leases</td><td>20 years</td></tr></table></p><p>The termination provisions vary depending on the type of agreement concerned but in general terms, the position is as follows:</p><p>- Where the local authority or AHB acts as the landlord to the tenant and is responsible for the management of the tenancy and the maintenance of the property, the lease term must be for a minimum of 10 years. Break clauses after 10 years may be negotiated as part of the lease agreement and theproperty may be sold by the property owner during the term of the lease, on the condition that the lease agreement is transferred to the new owner and the local authority or AHB are notified in advance and consent to same.</p><p>- Where the property owner acts as the landlord to the tenant and retains responsibility for the management of the tenancy and maintenance of the property, the terms of the Residential Tenancies Acts apply. Under this type of agreement, the tenant acquires the right to a Part 4 tenancy under the Residential Tenancies Act after 6 months and as such, the tenancy may not be terminated other than in accordance with section 34 of the Act.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities. However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century. Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era. My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  The main issues being addressed in the General Scheme include the consolidation of over 20 separate pieces of legislation dealing with commercial rates into a single enactment; improved enforcement powers for local authorities to collect rates; provisions to allow the local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support national and local policy objectives; and provisions for temporary abatement for vacant premises.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill on 11 April 2017.  The General Scheme of the Bill has been submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Committee has been invited to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny on the proposals. </p></reply>

Its primary purpose is to provide a dedicated multifunctional facility in which ministers and/or senior officials convene to co-ordinate the response in the event of a major emergency or incident requiring a national-level response.  The NECC is activated in support of all emergencies which require a national-level response. Staff from the Office of Emergency Planning (civil and military) in the Department of Defence manage the Centre on an ongoing basis during such emergencies providing support to the Lead and other Departments. The centre is available to all departments with an emergency planning/management role and is regularly used outside of emergencies for meetings of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and associated subgroups along with being used for training and exercises.  The National Emergency Coordination Group (NECG) is a generic group representative of all Government Departments and Agencies providing support to the Lead Government Department chairing the NECG. The NECG is activated in response to an emergency and when activated is chaired by the Department with lead responsibility in respect of the particular emergency. The NECG meets in the NECC. While there is no specific annual funding allocated to the National Emergency Coordination Group there is an annual funding budget for the Office of Emergency Planning which maintains the NECC and that is set out in the following table. This funding covers the operational, maintenance and training costs associated with running the National Emergency Coordination Centre, the annual &lsquo;Be Winter Ready&rsquo; campaign and any costs attributed to meetings of the National Emergency Coordination Group (NECG). <table><tr><th>YEAR </th><th>BUDGET </th></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>&euro;400,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;410,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;400,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;365,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>&euro;365,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>&euro;500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>&euro;500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>&euro;500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>&euro;500,000 (projected) </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The European Union Military Committee (EUMC) is the highest military body within the EU and was established by Council Decision 2001/79/CFSP of 22 January 2001. It is composed of the Chiefs of Defence (CHODs) of the Member States who, on a day to day basis, are represented in Brussels by the Military Representatives from the Permanent Representations of the member States. Ireland has participated in the EU Military Committee since its establishment.   </p>  <p>  Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Council Decision 2001/79/CFSP, setting up the Military Committee of the European Union  , the Chairman of the Military Committee of the European Union is appointed by the Council on the recommendation of the EU Military Committee meeting at the level of the Chiefs of Defence. Accordingly, the next Chair of the European Union Military Committee (EUMC) will be selected by secret vote by the Chiefs of Defence of the EU Member States, at a meeting scheduled to take place next month in Brussels. On the basis of that vote, the Chair is then appointed by the European Council for a fixed period of three years. </p>  <p>  The Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006, provides in section 3(1)(a) that, a contingent or member of the Permanent Defence Force may, with the prior approval of and on the authority of the Government, be despatched for service outside the State for the purposes of carrying out duties as a military representative or filling appointments or postings outside the State, including secondments to any international organisation. Pursuant to this provision, the Government, at its meeting of 19th   September, 2017, decided to nominate Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, as Chair of the EU Military Committee, consistent with the provisions of the Defence Acts. </p>  <p>  Following that approval, and on the authority of Government, Ireland&rsquo;s nomination of Vice Admiral Mellett for election to the position of Chair of the European Union Military Committee was formally communicated when nominations opened. The nomination for appointment as Chair of the EU Military Committee further demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to remaining at the core of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).   </p>  <p>  Chairmanship of the EUMC has no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. Ireland already participates fully in the work of the Committee through our Military Representative in Brussels and the biannual meetings of EU Chiefs of Defence. The Deputy may wish to note that both Finland (2001-2004) and Sweden (2009-2012) have already held the position of Chair of the EUMC as neutral countries.   </p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the strongest contributors to CSDP operations and remains committed to all aspects of CSDP and to the role CSDP can play in UN mandated peacekeeping operations. It is the case that the UN has continually stressed the important role the EU can and does play in support of International Peace and Security. Should Vice Admiral Mellett be successful, it would help to reinforce the existing strategic relationship between the EU and the UN.</p></reply>

Various factors can give rise to such claims.    The rates of remuneration and conditions of employment in the Defence Forces are set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various parts of the public sector. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (the Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy for Public Servants and members of the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) agreement in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Forces. An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017. An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017. </p>  <p>  The pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, has been increased further following an agreement facilitated by the WRC between the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA. These improved payscales, have been backdated to 1 July 2016. The payments were made to relevant personnel on 30 August 2017. </p>  <p>  On completion of recruit and three star training newly qualified 3 star Privates and their Naval Service equivalent can expect minimum gross annual earnings of &euro;27,000 (inclusive of military service allowance). </p>  <p>  Going forward, there is the potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for:</p>  <p>  - a 7.25% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning less than &euro;30,000 per annum</p>  <p>  - a 6.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning between &euro;30,001 and &euro;32,000 per annum, and</p>  <p>  - a 5.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning over &euro;32,000 per annum. </p>  <p>  The proposals have been presented to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations who participated in the negotiation process. They are subject to ballot by members of the Associations. </p>  <p>Future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will continue to be dealt with within this process.</p></reply>

This was a special acknowledgement from the Government to the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, both Permanent and Reserve, who served during the centenary year of 2016.  The 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal was awarded as a commemorative medal, personal to an individual&rsquo;s service in the Defence Forces in the course of 2016.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to former members of the Defence Forces who were not in service in 2016.  Since the foundation of the State many thousands of personnel have served in the Defence Forces.  It would not be administratively possible within the resources of the Department to identify and contact all of these persons, decide on eligibility and, in the case of infirm or deceased former members resolve who should get the medal on their behalf. </p>  <p>  At my request, however, discussions took place between the Department and the Veterans&rsquo; Organisations, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Organisation of National Ex-service personnel (ONE), and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO), to explore alternative means of recognition of the contribution of veterans to the centenary commemorative events in 2016.  Following these discussions it was agreed that a single presentation would be made to each of the Veterans Organisations of a framed medal with an accompanying citation in recognition of the significant contribution of members of the three organisations to the 1916 centenary commemorative events and their service to the State. The medal would have a bar with the term Veteran inscribed on it.  </p>  <p>  I agreed that a plaque would be given to each of IUNVA&rsquo;s 21 Posts and to each of O.N.E.&rsquo;s 41 Branches.  As you know, I presented one plaque to each of the three Veterans&rsquo; Organisations at the Defence Forces&rsquo; Veterans&rsquo; Day which took place in the Defence Forces Training Centre, The Curragh, on Sunday 8th October 2017.

Equipment priorities for the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process. In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.  The White Paper on Defenceprovides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks. The tender competition for the procurement of the three new aircraft is underway and the cost will be determined by the outcome of the tender competition. </p><p>The two Air Corps CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019.
