There are currently approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). HAP will provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.  Rent supplement will continue to be paid to those already in the private rented sector who have a short-term need of rental support, often as a result of the loss of employment.  <br/><br/>HAP was introduced in Cork County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council on 15th September, 2014 and in South Dublin County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council on 1st October, 2014. <br/><br/>To date, over 200 customers have been taken onto the HAP scheme, which includes both direct transfers from the rent supplement scheme and new applicants that have being assessed as qualifying for social housing support by the local authority. <br/><br/>Department of Social Protection officials are continuing to work closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to support the implementation of HAP within the selected local authorities.  <br/><br/>HAP Statistics by Local Authority are provided in the attached tabular statement. Statistics on rent supplement recipients are maintained on a County basis. Rent Supplement recipients and expenditure for 2012 and 2013 are also provided.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: HAP Recipients by Local Authority</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>158</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>207</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Table 2:</b><br/><br/><b>Rent Supplement: End of Year Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2012 to Date </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Recipients</th><th>Cost &euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>87,684</td><td>422,536</td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>79,788</td><td>372,909</td></tr><tr><td>End October 2014</td><td>72,444</td><td>284,000</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Table 3</b><br/><br/><b>Rent Supplement Recipients by County, End October 2014</b><table><tr><th>COUNTY</th><th>RECIPIENTS</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td> 1,065 </td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>398 </td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td> 1,354 </td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td> 8,351 </td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td> 1,826 </td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>26,978 </td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td> 3,608 </td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td> 1,741 </td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td> 3,751 </td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td> 1,129 </td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td> 1,010 </td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>335 </td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td> 2,565 </td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>475 </td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td> 2,272 </td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td> 1,639 </td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td> 1,744 </td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>359 </td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td> 1,043 </td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>679 </td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>461 </td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td> 1,952 </td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td> 1,386 </td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td> 1,524 </td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td> 2,659 </td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td> 2,140 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>72,444</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-20a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112000062#WRA02100"><p>In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle long-term unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.<br/><br/>However, the Government also recognises the need for additional measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy. Pathways to Work 2015 prioritises the allocation of available resources to the long-term unemployed. While many long-term unemployed return to occupations that required little or no reskilling, the Government recognises that in some cases certain skills may not be in strong demand at a particular point in time or that a de-skilling effect may take place when someone remains out of work for a long-period of time. The ambition in Strand 3 of Pathways to Work 2015 is: &ldquo;<i>To provide unemployed people, in particular people who are long-term unemployed and young unemployed people, with opportunities to enhance their job prospects through value-adding work experience, education and training activities</i>.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Hence, the Department in conjunction with other Departments and agencies (most notably the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills and Solas) has put in place a range of options for reskilling as part of the wider whole of government approach contained in the Pathways to Work Strategy. A range of SOLAS, ETB Further Education and Training and Higher Education Programmes are available to meet the needs of the long term unemployed. Fifty seven thousand places are targeted for the long term unemployed in 2014, and subject to demand a further 57,000 will be made available in 2015. <br/><br/>The places targeted for the long-term unemployed in 2014 include 8,700 places on Solas (formerly F&Aacute;S) training courses for unemployed people, 6,200 on Momentum, 4,300 on Springboard, 4,000 on PLC courses, 3,200 on VTOS, and 29,000 opportunities on other further education programmes. <br/><br/>The former FAS training provision is being progressively transferred to the new regional Education and Training Boards (ETBs) up to mid-2014. The main FAS/Solas programmes of relevance to the long term unemployed are Specific Skills Training, Traineeships, Local Training Initiatives, and training for people with disabilities through Specialist Training Providers.<br/><br/>MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, was rolled out by the Department of Education in 2013. MOMENTUM supports the provision of free education and training projects to allow up to 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.<br/><br/>Long-term unemployed people undertaking re-training on a full-time basis generally qualify either for a Solas training allowance or for support from the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Back to Education Allowance scheme. Where the training is part-time or of shorter duration, support may be provided under the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;amp;D). The PTEO allows participants to attend part-time day/evening or weekend courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis. Payment is made at the same rate as the primary payment and no maximisation of payments occurs. The ET&amp;amp;D allows participants to attend certain courses of education, training or development of short duration and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists. Participants are exempt from engaging in job search but must be available for employment should an opportunity arise. <br/><br/>In conjuction with these programmes, there is also ongoing engagement between Intreo Offices and Education and Training Boards (ETBs) to ensure that training programmes are relevant to the needs of the unemployed. <br/><br/>More generally, substantial reform is being undertaken in the education and training sector to ensure programmes are relevant to the needs of learners and employers. <br/><br/>When taken together these reforms and initiatives constitute a comprehensive approach to the reskilling of the long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

Depending on the supply being offered, different variations of VAT treatment may apply, but in all cases, suppliers established in Ireland compete on a level playing field in the UK market with UK established suppliers.</p><p>  The EU VAT Directive, with which Irish and UK VAT legislation must comply, distinguishes between a supply of goods and a supply of services.  Where an Irish VAT registered trader makes a supply of goods to a UK business, the Irish trader zero-rates the supply and the UK business self-accounts for VAT on the goods.  If the UK trader purchases the goods from a UK business, VAT would apply on the supply as normal.  In both cases the UK trader will have the right to deduct the VAT charged on the goods if they are used for their taxable supplies.  In this case the VAT treatment of the supply of goods is the same whether the supply is made from an Irish or a UK based supplier.</p><p>  With regard to the supply of a service of the installation of fittings to a UK business, the same VAT treatment applies.  Where supplied by an Irish company, the service is zero-rated, and the UK business self-accounts for VAT.  Where supplied by a UK company VAT is charged on the supply as normal.  In both cases the UK trader will have the right to deduct the VAT charged on the service of the installation of fittings if they are used for their taxable supplies.  Again, there is no difference in the entitlement to deduct input VAT by the UK company who receives the services, whether the supplier is based in Ireland or the UK.</p><p>  The VAT situation differs where the service being supplied relates to the installation of fixtures, but in any event, there is no discrimination in terms of VAT deductibility depending on the location of the supplier.  Where a service consists of the installation of fixtures, the place of supply for VAT purposes will be the country where the installation takes place.  In the case referred to in your correspondence, the installation of fixtures will take place in Ireland which means the service is liable to VAT in Ireland.  In this situation the service should be charged with Irish VAT by both the Irish supplier and by the UK supplier, who will have to register for VAT in Ireland if not already registered. The UK recipient of the service will be charged to Irish VAT regardless of where the supplier of the service is based.  Where they are entitled to input VAT deductibility on the service received, the UK business can make a claim to the UK revenue authorities for a refund of the Irish VAT charged on the service.  While the VAT treatment is different in the case of the service of the installation of fixtures, than in the case of the service of the installation of fittings, and the supply of goods in general, it is still the case that UK and Irish suppliers of these services and goods operate on a level playing field in terms of VAT.</p></reply>

The main deductible expenses are:<br/><br/>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<br/><br/>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<br/><br/>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;<br/><br/>- the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and<br/><br/>- payment of local authority rates.<br/><br/>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.<br/><br/>Where the aggregate of deductible expenses in any year exceed the gross rental income, the amount of the deficit is set against rental profits of the same year from other property. Where there are no other rental profits in the same year, the deficit is carried forward as a rental loss for offset against rental profits in future years. <br/><br/>I have no plans at the moment to change the tax treatment of rental income for tax purposes, however, as a matter of course all such taxation measures and reliefs are considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

These frameworks are required to ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset for the State.</p><p>  In the case of IBRC (in Special Liquidation), the decision to sell the mortgage loans by way of portfolio sales was arrived at by the Special Liquidators having taken independent advice that the most efficient method of disposal and the one most likely to maximise sales was to sell the loans as part of a larger portfolio. It is important to note that the Special Liquidators are obligated by the conditions set out under the IBRC Act 2013 to ensure that the assets are sold at a price which maximises the overall return for its creditors including the State. Although I can understand that many mortgage owners might be interested in buying their loans, the time, cost and practicalities of this would make this option more costly.  The Government is not in a position to interfere with these decisions as to do so would leave the State open to challenge from other creditors of IBRC where it may be argued that decisions were taken for the benefit of one creditor over another.</p></reply>

The details of the scheme are set out in Circular 4 of 2013. <br/><br/>The Haddington Road Agreement has not changed the operation of the Civil Service career break scheme. It is a voluntary scheme and staff are aware that, under the rules of the scheme, there is no guarantee they will be able to return to the specific post they vacated before taking a career break. <br/><br/>The scheme sets out that the return to work is subject to there being an appropriate vacancy in the employing organisation.  In this context, civil service departments and offices are not required to facilitate a return to work for up to twelve months after the end date of the career break.  Individuals are required to sign a form of undertaking noting this fact, and their obligations around informing the HR Manager of their return to work, prior to commencing the career break.  If the organisation is aware that it is unlikely a vacancy will arise, the onus is on the organisation to ensure the person is put on the PAS redeployment panel and inform the individual of this and the fact that s/he will be circulated with redeployment vacancies. If it is not possible to make a reasonable offer within the 12 month period after the expiry of the career break, the possibility of facilitating the civil servant on a supernumerary basis must be explored.<br/><br/>Where the civil servant refuses a reasonable offer of work, the Department is under no further obligation to provide employment and can deem a refusal to be a resignation.<br/><br/>A copy of the Circular can be found at: .</p></reply>

Also required is the drafting and publication of a code of practice for the conduct of adjudications, which will be binding on all adjudicators operating under the Act, not just those appointed to cases by the Chair of the Adjudication panel.  Work on these items, and the required consultation with industry, has been and is ongoing. It is hoped that the Act will be implemented in full by Spring 2015.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-20a.95.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014112000063#WRB02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 to 41, inclusive, together. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my colleague Ged Nash TD, Minister for Business and Employment, presented the General Scheme of the proposed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for pre-legislative scrutiny at its meeting on 11 October last; it is my understanding that the Deputy was present at the meeting. The General Scheme and discussion which took place at the meeting addressed in detail most of the issues raised in this series of questions put down by the Deputy.</p><p>  The main purpose of the proposed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 is twofold. Firstly, it will provide for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of enterprise-level employment agreements. In this context an enterprise-level agreement means an agreement relating to the remuneration or the conditions of employment of workers of any class, type or group made between a trade union, or trade unions, of workers and an employer, or a trade union of employers that are binding only on the parties to the agreement.</p><p>  Such agreements will not be legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, nor would it be constitutionally permissible to so legislate. Indeed, prior to the Supreme Court ruling in the McGowan case, enterprise-level Registered Employment Agreements were not given general application on a sector-wide basis.</p><p>  Enterprise-level Registered Employment Agreements, which are in line with Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing voluntarist industrial relations system, provide certainty for the employer and workers in terms of rates of pay and other terms and conditions over the period of the agreement. Furthermore, all such agreements will be required to contain a provision that, if a trade dispute occurs between workers and their employer, a strike or lock-out shall not take place until the dispute has been submitted for settlement by negotiation in the manner specified in the agreement, thereby contributing to industrial peace in the enterprise or enterprises.</p><p>  As such agreements are not legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, the same constitutional issues regarding the delegation of legislative authority that arose in McGowan do not apply in these cases</p><p>  Such REAs will set terms and conditions across a range of matters; as they cannot undercut sectoral Orders, they cannot undermine such Orders.</p><p>  The Bill will separately provide for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers, particularly in the context of transnational provision of services and in the context of promoting harmonious relations between workers &ndash; in effect a framework to replace the former sectoral Registered Employment Agreements system, which included the Construction and Electrical Contracting Sector. </p><p>  In this context, the new framework proposes a mechanism whereby, in future, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and/or of workers, the Labour Court can initiate a review of the pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter. </p><p>  The Labour Court is identified as the appropriate expert body to make judgment calls in relation as to whether a review should be instigated in the first place and, where it is, to decide on what recommendation, if any, to make to the Minister. As the Labour Court is the delegated authority, the legislation does not provide for an appeal mechanism in this regard.</p><p>  This mechanism is in contrast with the previous REA system struck down by the Supreme Court which, prior to the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, provided for employment agreements made between trade unions and employer representatives being given general application by being registered by the Labour Court. The 2012 Act, which was not considered by the Supreme Court in McGowan, provided for a Statutory Order by the Minister confirming the registration of the agreement.</p><p>  The new legislation will provide the Labour Court with specific principles and policies that it will be obliged to take into account when considering whether to make and, if so, what recommendation to make to the Minister in relation to pay and pension/sick pay terms in a particular sector. In this context, the proposed Bill provides that the Labour Court shall not undertake an examination unless it is satisfied that the request applies to all workers of a particular class, type or group and their employers in the identified sector and that the Court is satisfied that it is desirable or expedient to have separate terms and conditions relating to pay, or pension scheme and sick pay scheme for that class, type or group. In addition, the Court shall only undertake an examination where it is satisfied that the organisation or organisations making the request is/are substantially representative of the class, type or group of workers and employers in the sector to which the request is expressed to apply, and any recommendation is likely to promote harmonious relations between such workers and employers.</p><p>  There is no specific definition of substantially representative in the proposed Bill, rather it will be a matter for the Labour Court to judge, based on the principles set out in the Bill. In this context, in satisfying itself  with regard to whether the parties are substantially representative, the Court will take into consideration -</p><p>  (i) the number of workers represented by the organisation representing the workers, and</p><p>  (ii) the number of workers employed by the employers represented by the organisation representing employers, in the class, type or group of workers to which the request is expressed to apply.</p><p>  The Court shall not make a recommendation to the Minister unless it is satisfied that</p><p>  i. to do so would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and assist in the avoidance of industrial unrest;</p><p>  ii. the recommendation is reasonably necessary to promote and preserve high standards of training and qualifications in the sector; and</p><p>  iii. the recommendation is reasonably necessary to ensure fair and sustainable rates of remuneration in the identified sector, in light of EU law on the transnational provision of services.</p><p>  The Court shall, for the purpose of making a recommendation to the Minister, take into account/ have regard to the following matters:</p><p>  (a) the potential impact of the recommendation on levels of employment and unemployment in the identified sector;</p><p>  (b) the terms of any relevant national agreement relating to pay and conditions for the time being in existence;</p><p>  (c) the potential impact of the recommendation on competitiveness in the identified sector;</p><p>  (d) the general level of wages in sectors within which workers of the same, class type or group are employed.</p><p>  If the Minister is satisfied that the process provided for in the new legislation has been complied with by the Labour Court, the Minister shall make the Order.  Where the Minister is not satisfied that the provisions have been complied with, he or she shall:</p><p>  i. refuse to make an order in accordance with the terms of the recommendation, and</p><p>  ii. notify the Court in writing of his or her decision and the reasons for the decision.</p><p>  The standard provisions dealing with the laying of orders before the Oireachtas are proposed.</p><p>  Where such an order is made in relation to a class, type or group of workers it will be binding across the sector to which it relates and will be enforceable by the National Employment Rights Authority. The existence of such a legislative provision is recognised under European Union law and ensures, in accordance with the Posted Workers Directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction, who may be using employees from lower wage economies, do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s robust suite of employment rights legislation, including any order made under this proposed legislation, applies to all workers, whether employed by a sub-contractor or other class of employer.  </p><p>  This sectoral mechanism proposed is constitutionally robust compared with the previous REA system struck down by the Supreme Court which, prior to the enactment of the IR (Amendment) Act 2012, provided for employment agreements made between trade unions and employer representatives being given general application by being registered by the Labour Court. As enterprise-level agreements never were and will not be legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, the same constitutional issues regarding the delegation of legislative authority that arose in McGowan do not apply in such cases.</p></reply>

The first annual APJ was launched in February 2012, and its first successor was published in February 2013. Together, these comprised over 600 specific actions. The third APJ was published in February of this year, building on and drawing lessons from its predecessors. This multi-annual Framework represents a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to strengthening the competitiveness of the Irish economy and to stimulating job creation and retention. Coupled with this, the APJ process contains a rigorous quarterly monitoring and reporting system.<br/><br/>The 2014 Action Plan, with a strong focus on the domestic economy, improving competitiveness and supporting our entrepreneurs and smaller firms with new Local Enterprise Offices, contains 385 actions. In total since the APJ was launched almost 1,000 actions have been proposed and progressed in order to deliver private sector-led, export-oriented economic growth and job creation.<br/><br/>The OECD has reviewed the APJ process and has found that the Plan&rsquo;s most striking innovation in the Irish public policy context is a coordination mechanism that ensures high-level political buy-in and oversight, whole-of-government engagement and the establishment of quarterly targets underpinned by a robust monitoring system.  <br/><br/>As of Q2 2014 there were1.9 million people were employed, an increase of 33,500 on last year. At 11% the rate of unemployment is still unacceptably high. This is why the Government has designated 2014 to be the &ldquo;year for jobs&rdquo;; we are working relentlessly to ensure that the unemployment rate continues to decrease.<br/><br/>In the third quarter of 2014, Departments and agencies were to deliver 100 measures relating to 84 of APJ2014&rsquo;s 385 actions. Some 88 of the measures due in Quarter 3 (Q3) of 2014 have been delivered, giving a completion rate of 88%. In delivering 88 third quarter measures under the Plan, the Government has, for example launched two programmes to support Youth/Graduate Entrepreneurship, a competitive Youth/Graduate Entrepreneurship Fund to complement the new  LEOs/Microfinance Youth Programme, and rolled out &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young  Entrepreneur&rdquo; competition which involves a total fund of &euro;2 million. The Government also launched a national trading online voucher scheme in Q3, which will target the distribution of 1,000 vouchers to Irish SME&rsquo;s in 2014, and which involves all 31 Local Enterprise Offices. These are just some examples of the practical job retention and job creation steps taken recently under the Action Plan process. <br/><br/>The Action Plan for Jobs is complemented with the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>labour market activation strategy. The <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy, first introduced in 2012 and led by the Department of Social Protection, seeks to ensure that as many newly created jobs as possible go to people on the Live Register. The key strands of Pathways to Work include incentivising employers to provide more jobs for those who are unemployed, better engagement with unemployed people, greater targeting of activation places and opportunities for those who are long-term unemployed, and incentivising the take-up of employment opportunities by unemployed jobseekers.<br/><br/>In addition, we are continually monitoring skills supply and demand within the economy through the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. For example, over recent years there have been substantial job gains in the high-tech sector. The Government&rsquo;s national ICT Skills Action Plan for 2014-2018 sets out a range of measures to build the domestic supply of high level ICT skills and will confer a significant advantage on companies operating in Ireland and create a substantial level of sustainable employment opportunities for Irish graduates.</p></reply>

The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works with High Potential Start-Up&rsquo;s (HPSUs) with a capability to start a business and sell in export markets, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing and internationally traded services, large companies employing 250 or more, and, Irish-based food and natural resources companies that are overseas owned or controlled. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients delivered &euro;17.1bn in exports and 149,718 full time jobs in 2013.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland supported 4,086 companies between 1 January 2009 and 18 November 2014, totalling &euro;707.8m broken down between grant (66%) and equity (34%) payments. Table 1 shows the number of companies supported each year. Some of the 4,086 companies would have received support in one or more years as a grant allocation would be drawn down over time.<br/><br/>The number of full time jobs created by Enterprise Ireland clients between 2009 and 2013 is given in Table 2. 2014 figures are not yet available as EI are currently in the process of carrying out the Annual Employment Survey for 2014.<br/><br/>The majority of funding from Enterprise Ireland is non-competitive and therefore each company&rsquo;s application is assessed based on a holistic view of the company&rsquo;s Development Plan, the need for financial assistance and the eligibility criteria for the individual financial support. EI provides a wide variety of Programmes to enterprises at different stages of the business life cycle. There are different formats for applying for funding (i.e. some are competitive and some are not). In general, EI does not reject companies but works to see what other programmes or assistance can be provided to the company to enable it to remain an EI client. For this reason, Enterprise Ireland does not maintain a database of each company that did not qualify for assistance.<br/><br/>All companies are encouraged to discuss their applications for financial supports with the Development Advisor prior to submitting an application. In some cases, as a result of this discussion, companies may be re-directed to apply for alternative financial supports that are more appropriate to their development needs.<br/><br/>Information in relation to the number of indigenous enterprises that had projects approved for grant aid from the County Enterprise Boards/Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in each of the past five years to date, and the number of jobs associated with the projects approved, is set out in Table 3 below.<br/><br/>Details of the number of any such applicants deemed to have failed to qualify for any assistance are not collated by the LEOs, since all LEO clients are offered some type of support, including non-financial supports such as business advice, training, mentoring, etc.<br/><br/><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th><b>2009</b></th><th><b>2010</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th><th><b>2013</b></th><th><b>2014 (1/1/2014 &ndash; 18/11/2014)</b></th></tr><tr><td>No of Companies paid per year</td><td>1,643</td><td>1,571</td><td>1,521</td><td>1,402</td><td>1,353</td><td>1,182</td></tr></table>Source: Cognos Payments Report ran 19/11/2014 and excludes Infrastructural clients, Shannon Free Zone transfer clients, Incubation Centres, Clients who were paid under the Employment Subsidy Scheme).<br/><br/><b>Table 2</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th><b>2009</b></th><th><b>2010</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th><th><b>2013</b></th></tr><tr><td>Full time gains</td><td>7,443</td><td>8,193</td><td>9,076</td><td>12,861</td><td>12,532</td></tr><tr><td>Total Full Time Employment </td><td>133,523</td><td>137,241</td><td>141,228</td><td>145,460</td><td>149,718</td></tr></table>Source: Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey Results for each year<br/><br/><b>Table 3: No. of Projects and Jobs Associated with LEO Funding</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Projects Approved</th><th>Amount Approved</th><th>Associated Jobs at Application Stage</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,082</td><td>&euro;15,082,055</td><td>1,614.5 </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,072</td><td>&euro;15,296,098</td><td>2,365.5 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>964</td><td>&euro;14,939,967</td><td>1,916.5 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>993</td><td>&euro;15,576,362</td><td>2,069.5 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 to date</td><td>650</td><td>&euro;10,528,674</td><td>1,172.0 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. In fact since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced.  While some of the specific data sought by the Deputy in his questions is not available in the precise format requested, overall trends are very positive. The Annual Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 since 2011. The latest data for Agency &ndash;supported Internationally Trading Services companies show a rise of over 14,000 in the same period. Other Services sectors in the domestic economy have shown significant growth in employment in recent years. <br/><br/>Manufacturing encompasses a broad range of sub-segments that present considerable opportunity for growth: Developing manufacturing has been adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting a range of indigenous and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative. The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Manufacturing Strategy recommendations. <br/><br/>Services encompasses a diverse range of activities -  there is a complex mix of high value added internationally traded activities such as software, financial services and customer support services as well as more labour intensive (primarily) locally trading sectors such as retail, logistics, professional services and a range of private and public sector delivered healthcare,  education and transport services. <br/><br/>The Government have made great strides in addressing various issues impacting on costs for business over recent years  and we will continue to carry out analysis on  the various factors impacting on the cost base of all sectors, including manufacturing and services.  Maintaining and improving our competitiveness is an ongoing priority. <br/><br/>Innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in both the Manufacturing and Services sectors. Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. By way of illustration, in 2013 SFI had links to 65 per cent of the jobs announced by IDA in fields covered by SFI&rsquo;s legal remit.<br/><br/>The importance of innovation and technology to Ireland&rsquo;s on-going and future economic recovery is well recognised by the Government as being crucial to growth in both our indigenous and FDI sectors. Evidence, from both the EU and internationally, shows that the Government&rsquo;s strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our Science Technology and Innovation investment is paying off.  While is it not possible to fully disaggregate the contribution of Innovation and Technology to job creation, all the evidence is that it is very significant, as Ireland moves up the value chain and exploits our competitive position  in  knowledge based activity.  We have actively pursued the availability of EU funding for Research and Innovation and, in particular, we will ensure that we will access significant funding from both new EU <i>Horizon 2020 Programme,</i>to further enhance Irish business capability.<br/><br/>Measures designed to support industry growth are set out in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014</i>and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start‐up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment. Work is currently underway to draft our 2015 Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

Since 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness rankings in both the IMD and WEF competitiveness reports has improved &ndash; from 24th to 15th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, and from 29th to 25th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report. In the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2015 report, Ireland is ranked 13th out of 189.<br/><br/>According to the WEF, Ireland ranks ahead of other advanced countries in categories such as Institutions (e.g., rule of law, corporate governance, etc.), Labour Market Efficiency, and the Goods Market category (e.g. presence of competition, taxes, etc.). Irish scores are weakest in the 'Macro-Economic Environment' category which is driven by Government debt and borrowing. Market size and access to funding are also somewhat weaker. These weaknesses are being addressed through Government macro-economic policies and the on-going focus on improving the performance of financial institutions.  Ireland&rsquo;s positive and improving business environment was noted in the European Commission&rsquo;s <i>Member States&rsquo; Competitiveness Report</i>(published 11 September 2014).<br/><br/>All of these factors reflect Ireland&rsquo;s enduring strength as an investment location. This strength is reflected in the performance of firms support by the Enterprise Agencies &ndash; for example, total permanent, full-time employment in agency-assisted companies in the industrial and services sectors amounted to 303,155 in 2013, an increase of 8,579 jobs on 2012 employment.<br/><br/>Foreign Direct Investment has been buoyant so far this year, with IDA Ireland securing over 100 investments in the first half of 2014, up from 70 in the same period of 2013, with potential job creation of 8,000.  The IDA note that 40% of the investments came from companies investing in Ireland for the first time, as Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition continues to resonate with new investors. The Government has recently published a Policy Statement on FDI designed to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment offering continues to be attractive and competitive. <br/><br/>On the indigenous side, Enterprise Ireland had a record year for job creation and exports in 2013 and are the outlook is for continued strong export growth for 2014. I recently published the National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship in Ireland, which aims to support the creation of an additional 93,000 jobs from start-up companies in the next five years.<br/><br/>The APJ 2015, which is currently under development, provides further opportunity to design actions to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competiveness, which will provide the underpinning for a continued strong investment performance.</p></reply>

For example, the National Competitiveness Council note that office rents in Dublin on new leases fell by 28 per cent between 2008 and 2013 considerably improving the cost competitiveness of high spec commercial rental vis-&agrave;-vis other international cities. Prime high street rents have also come under downward pressure over recent years.</p><p>  The resumption of economic growth and related upswing in activity has, however, seen commercial rental prices begin to increase once again. This is particularly the case in relation to the market for commercial office space, which may reflect a lag in the development of well located, high quality premises.</p><p>  As with all cost factors, it is important that we remain vigilant and carefully monitor Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness. </p><p>  In relation to the matter of upward only rent reviews, despite extensive consideration, it has not proved possible to develop a targeted scheme to tackle upward only rent reviews in existing business leases that would not be vulnerable to a legal challenge or require compensation to be paid to property owners. This is based on advice from the Attorney General. The situation has not changed since the receipt of the advice of the Attorney General and, as has been indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on the subject of upward only rent review clauses, there are no plans to re-examine the decision which was taken in 2011.</p></reply>

I am very pleased that the Member States concerned and the EU Commission have already taken urgent steps to control the spread of the virus. The measures taken include the culling of the poultry on the affected holding, the establishment of protection and surveillance zones, the prohibition of movements to sell live poultry, eggs, poultry meat and other poultry products to other EU countries and non-EU countries and the culling of affected flocks only in the restricted zones. These measures will help to reduce the likelihood of the disease spreading to other countries, such as Ireland, but clearly, given the nature of the disease and the fact that it can be spread by migratory birds, they cannot guarantee that the disease will not spread.<br/><br/>I would like to stress that avian influenza is a disease of poultry and that there is no known food safety risk associated with the strain of the disease which has been confirmed in the 3 countries.  The strain of the disease which has been confirmed is not the H5N1 virus that can cause severe disease in people who are infected from close contact with birds. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has stated that no human infections with the particular form of virus which has been confirmed as being involved in these outbreaks have ever been reported world-wide and that the public health threat from these outbreaks is considered very low.<br/><br/>In light of the increased threat of an incursion of this disease into this country, my Department has reviewed its state of preparedness to deal with an outbreak of the disease. The Department has a full range of contingency plans in place and, should an outbreak occur, it will take immediate measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The Department has been liaising with other State agencies including FSAI and the Department of Health on the matter. Close co-operation is being maintained with Bird Watch Ireland in relation to migratory patterns of wild birds. My Department has also been in touch with officials in DARDNI with a view to ensuring maximum co-operation in the event of an outbreak.<br/><br/>The key focus at this stage is that bio-security measures are applied at the optimal level on farms. In view of this, contact is being maintained with farm representatives and poultry processors to ensure that a high degree of vigilance is being maintained with a view to preventing the incursion of the disease, insofar as this is possible, and to detect an outbreak at an early stage in order to prevent its spread. Avian Influenza is notifiable to the Department and it is a legal requirement to notify any unusual increase in mortalities or any suspicion of the disease to the veterinary practitioner and to the Department.<br/><br/>The Department also operates an Avian Influenza hotline (<b>1890 252 283)</b>where members of the public can report dead wild birds.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that the Department continues to maintain the upmost vigilance in its approach towards this disease and it will continue to monitor the situation very carefully.</p></reply>

Chaplains are mostly Roman Catholic, but also come from the Church of Ireland and Methodist denominations. Spiritual advisors of other churches/religions can also attend the prisons on a visiting basis, subject to normal visit rules.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service fully acknowledges that Chaplaincy has a significant contribution to make as part of the multi-disciplinary team in a prison, addressing the physical, social and spiritual needs of prisoners in a holistic way. Prisons are difficult environments in which to live and prisoners face many personal challenges in their daily lives and at particular times of crisis, for example, family bereavement, health problems or loss of a court appeal and also in settling into prison upon committal or getting ready for release. Prison chaplains can offer a comforting and supportive presence that is independent and professional, while working as part of the prison multi-disciplinary team reporting to the Governor.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has recently secured sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the filling of 3.5 chaplaincy vacancies throughout the prison estate, specifically: 1 post each in Cork and Limerick and half time positions in the Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Loughan House Open Centre. This will increase resources of the chaplaincy service to 15 posts, covering 14 institutions. The intention is to bring the total number of chaplains in the prison service up to 18.5, in order to ensure an effective and meaningful chaplaincy service. These new chaplains recruited from a Public Appointments Service competition will be direct employees of the Irish Prison Service.</p></reply>

Membership of the PSA Board is as prescribed in the Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) and includes an officer of my Department.  Members of the Board act in accordance with the primary legislation, the Ethics in Public Office Acts, the PSA General Governance Guidelines (which are based on the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies) and the Authority&rsquo;s Code of Business Conduct. In addition, the Authority is subject to annual audit by my Department and by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>  One of the security services prescribed for regulation in the primary legislation is that of 'installer of security equipment' which includes services such as intruder alarms, access control and CCTV.  In order to obtain a licence contractors are required to meet standards specified by the Authority.  I am informed by the Authority that the standard required for the access control sector is SR 40:2005 - an Irish Standard Recommendation for electronic security services.  For CCTV, both the SR 40 standard and PSA 2006:12 are required, the latter being the Authority's requirements for CCTV installation. SR 40 is also the standard for intruder alarms along with two European Standards, EN 50131:1 and EN 50131:7.  It is a requirement of SR 40 that all installations comply with the national wiring rules (ET 101). I further understand that compliance with SR 40 is certified on an annual basis by auditing bodies accredited to Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB).  The audit includes a visit to at least two installations to ensure full compliance with the standards. Failure to meet the requirements of a standard can result in a licence being suspended or revoked. </p><p>  In addition, the PSA has informed me that all PSA licensed contractors operate within the regulations set down by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), the body responsible for the regulation of the electrical industry. Where CER identifies a breach of their electrical regulations involving a PSA licensed contractor the Authority will take action against the licensee. To date, the Authority has not been advised of any such breach.</p><p>  ET 101 is published by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland and the Authority is not in a position to say who has obtained copies of same. </p><p>  The PSA has currently issued over 650 licences in the access control sector, 640 CCTV licences and 610 intruder alarm licences, with contractors observing regulations set by the Authority and the CER.  I am satisfied that the Board of the Authority is acting in a proper manner and is applying the required standards of corporate governance and oversight of the Authority's operational remit. </p></reply>

The Act states that a person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person&rsquo;s birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.<br/><br/>The Act also provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must -<br/><br/>- be of full age or be a minor <i>born in the State</i><br/><br/>- be of good character<br/><br/>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years<br/><br/>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation<br/><br/>- have, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows&mdash; <br/><br/>(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and<br/><br/>(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.<br/><br/>The parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to a child born in the State who did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship may apply for a certificate of naturalisation on their behalf using Form 11, which is available on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website at www.inis.gov.ie.<br/><br/>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<br/><br/>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This permission was renewed subsequently until 1 September, 2008, the expiry date on the passport of the person concerned.

These functions are provided from the Burgh Quay offices in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The offices also provides a range of other immigration related services with in the region of 130,000 people per annum attending in person at the office. These include applications for re-entry visas which are issued to visa-required nationals resident in Ireland to ensure they can return following a trip to their home country or a third country.  There is no requirement to attend in person to apply for such a visa and a postal service and a drop-box service are provided.</p><p>  The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to five-hundred people  who attend at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at this registration office, to ensure that those attending are dealt with on a &lsquo;first come first served&rsquo; basis.  In addition those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.  Specific times are set aside for certain categories of persons such as students.  In addition, to deal with the recent high level of demand for services the office opened on two recent Saturdays: 4 October and 11 October 2014.</p><p>  In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at my offices.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  For the majority of customers the Garda National Immigration Bureau provides a 'same day service' at its Burgh Quay office.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s customer service charter encompasses INIS and the organisation is continually seeking to improve the quality of services provided to customers.  A major overhaul of the public reception facilities in Burgh Quay with vastly improved public areas was completed last year.  In addition, the immigration service is planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments as part of a wider plan to transfer the registration function from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS.  The aim of the booking system is to give certainty to customers that they will be dealt with within a stated time window and at the same time enabling the immigration service to match its staff resources to meet demand at any particular time.  The new reception facilities have been designed to cater for such a system.</p><p>  Finally, I might add that this office is probably one of the busiest Public Offices with some of the longest opening times in the State.  As I indicated earlier, around 130,000 persons attend the Burgh Quay office each year, which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate presents ongoing logistical challenges.  I am anxious that queuing be reduced to the absolute minimum at the earliest possible opportunity and consistent with the requirement to protect our immigration system from abuses.  I am confident that the measures outlined above will further improve the services provided to customers calling to this office.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me, as Minister, to interpret or otherwise provide what would amount to legal advice on particular matters of probate which may also be the subject of ongoing legal dispute between any of the parties concerned.  It should also be pointed out that a number of these matters come within the remit of the Probate Office whichis not a Government office but operates under the 'non-contentious' probate jurisdiction of the High Court. Further information relating to the Probate Office, which has a number of district branches, can be found on the website www.courts.ie. <br/><br/>While I do from time to time receive correspondence relating to probate matters and while the general issues so raised may come to inform policy and legislative change, I am not, as Minister, the appropriate authority to deal with specific or individual complaints in this area. Should a client have concerns about the conduct of a solicitor in dealing with specific matters relating to wills or probate, then he or she may wish to make a complaint under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2011. Under the Acts the Law Society is the designated regulatory body for solicitors in the State and complaints should be made within that legislative framework. An aggrieved client wishing to make such a complaint under the Solicitors Acts should contact the Law Society directly. Much of the relevant information, including the Society&rsquo;s contact details, is to be found on the website including guidance on how to make a complaint.<br/><br/>The independent Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal is a further route of redress for anyone who is unhappy with the legal services they received from a solicitor. The Tribunal deals with allegations of serious misconduct and may be accessed directly by members of the public. The website provides guidance in this regard. A request for a review of a decision of the Law Society in relation to a complaint made may also be made at a later stage to the Independent Adjudicator ().<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>Should it be considered in their best interests, aggrieved clients may also choose to pursue their case through the judicial process.</p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.</p><p>  I am aware that a campaign by the staff associations not to pay the fee is actively underway and I am concerned regarding the possible implications for the health service and patient safety should this action continue.  My Department requested the Board to give this matter very careful consideration at its meeting on 19th November, with a view to agreeing and implementing a course of action most likely to achieve a satisfactory outcome. I understand that the staff associations have sought discussions with the Board in this regard.</p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <br/><br/>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <br/><br/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.<br/><br/>In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br/><br/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25th July 2014 and is currently being considered in line with the agreed procedures and timescales. No further comment is possible at this time as the HSE decision making process is ongoing.<br/><br/>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department, and the HSE, fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug. While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

In this context all public nursing homes are currently registered with HIQA.<br/><br/>In 2013 HIQA issued a regulatory notice in relation to Standard 25, which addresses the physical environment, advising the sector that <i>&quot;where particular criteria regarding premises are not met in the Centre, the provider must provide clear evidence of the other ways by which they are reaching the Standard and must demonstrate to the Chief Inspector that these alternative arrangements are delivering on the Standard for each individual resident. In the case of Standard 25, the Chief Inspector will require substantial and exceptional justification for any premises which purports to meet Standard 25 without implementation of the individual criteria.&rdquo;  </i><br/><br/>Registration renewals for the majority of these are due from the middle of next year. Bearing in mind their age and structure, public nursing homes face real challenges and require investment in excess of the funding that will be available in the short to medium term.  <br/><br/>It is important that we do everything possible to apply appropriate standards to all facilities. It is also a fact that publicly-run facilities provide bed capacity which is critically needed by older people, particularly by those with high or complex care needs for whom public facilities are often the only place that can meet their needs. Notwithstanding the problems that some facilities face with structures and facilities, the vast majority of their residents receive excellent levels of care. Without these public facilities many older people would simply have nowhere to go, other than our acute hospitals which are already under pressure.<br/><br/>The critical thing for me is to manage this situation in the best interests of the older people affected by it, and discussions have already taken place between the HSE and HIQA on the issues that arise for facilities around the country. In addition, my Department and the HSE are working to establish the options that may be available in this regard and how we can ensure that older people continue to be looked after. That is and will remain my priority.</p></reply>

The review was directed by a Steering Committee chaired by an independent chairperson and included key officials from four Government Departments.  The Report makes a number of recommendations including relating to the challenges associated with the operation of one-diplomat missions.<br/><br/>Overall, the review found that the work of our bilateral mission network in other EU member states plays a key role in helping Ireland maintain close relations with its EU partners and in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic and other interests. It also notes that, with quite modest resources, the missions do what they set out to do or are called upon to do; that they provide a platform to advance Ireland&rsquo;s policy objectives within the EU; and that in a variety of ways, these missions make important and timely contributions to promoting and protecting Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests, including helping rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.<br/><br/>In discussing one-diplomat missions, the report notes the advantages and drawbacks of such representations and also highlights locations where such a model is not realistic - such as in countries where, for example, there are high demands for consular services - and the skills set required to oversee a one-diplomat mission. The advantages include reduced operating costs and the ability to maintain an active presence on the ground in a time of reduced resources, while the drawbacks include a high administrative burden on the Head of Mission.<br/><br/>The Department has a duty of care in respect of all staff serving abroad regardless of the size or the location of the mission.  We currently operate twelve one-diplomat missions (10 in Europe and 2 in the US) and, while there is no sense that these missions are &ldquo;fraught with difficulty&rdquo;, we do recognise that one-diplomat missions will from time to time require additional assistance from HQ or a neighbouring mission. Our Human Resources Unit has the capacity to make temporary assignments to cover leave or other absences, while Lead Units at HQ continue to make greater use of video conference facilities for ongoing engagement with missions as well as for planning and training purposes. In addition, the upcoming Heads of Mission conference in early 2015 will provide an opportunity to discuss the operations of these missions with the relevant Heads of Mission.</p></reply>

This FAC &ndash; the first chaired by the new High Representative Federica Mogherini &ndash; had a very busy agenda, with discussions on Ukraine, the Middle East, Ebola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Libya.</p><p>  Ukraine was the first item to be addressed. Our discussions focused on the path to peace, the reform process and maintaining a firm EU response to the crisis. The situation in Ukraine remains extremely fragile and I am deeply concerned in particular by reports of the increased level of violence and troop and weaponry movements in Eastern Ukraine. During our discussions I reiterated the importance of the full implementation of the Minsk agreement, and the need for a sustainable political solution, based on the respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, with clear guarantees of border security, disarmament of all illegal groups and the withdrawal of foreign forces. I joined with my colleagues in supporting a new initiative by High Representative Mogherini to undertake outreach to the parties involved. This will complement the important contribution being made by the OSCE. I also joined with colleagues in welcoming the parliamentary elections which took place on 26 October in Ukraine, and in looking forward to the early formation of a new Government which can seize the mandate for reform given to it by the Ukrainian people. I believe that there is now a need and an opportunity for outreach, national dialogue and reconciliation. At the Council meeting I stressed the need for the new Government to implement an ambitious reform programme to build confidence among the people throughout Ukraine.</p><p>  The question of an appropriate EU response to the deteriorating security situation in Eastern Ukraine and the illegal and illegitimate elections, which took place in Donetsk and Luhansk on 2 November, was also discussed. A decision was reached to prepare further sanctions against separatists by the end of November. Council conclusions on Ukraine were adopted.</p><p>  The Council then exchanged views on latest developments in the Middle East Peace Process and received a report from the High Representative on her recent visit to the region. I had advocated such a visit and welcome it as a sign of the continued priority which the EU accords this issue. The growing violence by both sides in East Jerusalem and the West Bank is of great concern, and shows us that continued political failure will leave a vacuum which more militant or despairing voices will fill. Gaza has just highlighted the perils of allowing an unsustainable situation to simply drift on. I believe that the EU must become more actively engaged in the efforts to re-launch the peace process, and in confronting the increasingly serious threats to securing a viable, negotiated two-State solution. I am confident that High Representative Mogherini will embrace a more active role for the EU so that we can play our part in bringing about a comprehensive peace settlement. At our meeting Foreign Minister Wallstrom also took the opportunity to brief the Council on Sweden&rsquo;s recognition of Palestine. Council conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process were adopted.</p><p>  The Council was then briefed by EU Ebola coordinator Christos Stylianides on his priorities and on the findings of his mission together with Health Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis to the affected countries in West Africa. With the EU and its Member States having together pledged &euro;1 billion in funding, the EU is the prime donor amongst the international community in addressing Ebola. Ireland continues to work closely with EU partners as well as through the UN system to ensure a coordinated and robust response to this crisis. On the ground in West Africa, Ireland is working to combat the spread of Ebola, providing support of over &euro;17 million to the affected countries. Three members of the Irish Defence Forces will also be deployed to Sierra Leone to reinforce Ireland's Embassy in Freetown. The Council also discussed a proposal from Germany and France for the EU to establish a reserve pool of health experts which would allow for quick and targeted deployment in future health crises similar to the Ebola crisis. It was decided that this proposal could be considered at a future point following the current crisis. Council conclusions on Ebola were adopted.</p><p>  The Council took stock of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the elections on 12 October. Ministers discussed ways and means to encourage reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European perspective for the country. Ireland has long been a strong supporter of Bosnia and Herzegovina&rsquo;s EU aspirations and we are supportive of proposals that might unblock the current stand still. It remains important however that there is no relaxation of the substantive conditions which are an integral part of the enlargement process.</p><p>  The Council briefly discussed the current situation in Libya. I joined with my colleagues in expressing our full support for the efforts of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Bernardino Leon, to address the current crisis for the benefit of the people of Libya.</p><p>  Finally the Council approved, without discussion, the Council Conclusions on CSDP which were formally adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council (Defence) on 18 November.</p></reply>

Since Ireland has not yet decided to recognise Palestine, it would not be appropriate for us to suggest to EU partners that they need to do so.</p><p>  At the recent Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on 17 November, Ministers did informally exchange views on the question of recognition, and Sweden in particular set out the thinking behind their own recent decision. Many partners, including Ireland, are open in principle to recognition as part of the search for a comprehensive peace in the region, and at a time when it would help achieve that objective. At this time no other partner has decided to follow Sweden&rsquo;s example.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to the earliest possible achievement of a sovereign Palestinian state as part of an agreed two-state solution to the conflict and all our policies are constructively designed to advance this goal.</p></reply>

SOLAS with the assistance of relevant experts such as the ESRI, employers and local and national organisations have published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system. The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development.</p><p>  In addition to the 5 year Strategy, SOLAS has published a first ever integrated Further Education and Training Services Plan for 2014 and it provides information on the range of further education and training funded by the Irish Government and it will set out in detail how the State's investment in 2014 will be used by SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards to meet the skills needs of learners and employers.</p><p>  The Government recognises the importance of a modern well-functioning apprenticeship system in meeting skills needs and supporting economic growth. As part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative my Department undertook a review of the Irish Apprenticeship system to determine whether the current model should be retained, adapted or replaced. The review was tasked with taking into account the needs of both learners and industry and to ensure that we have a value for money system that is cost effective and sustainable into the future.</p><p>  An independent Review Group undertook a substantial consultation process with all major Stakeholders as well as inviting submissions from members of the public. 69 written submissions were received by the review group in that context. The report of the Independent Review Group made a number of recommendations regarding a new structure for Apprenticeship, which is envisaged as being relevant to a much wider group of enterprise sectors. Recommendations were also made in relation to current apprenticeships.</p><p>  Following on from the Review an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published on the 30th June 2014. As part of this plan a new Apprenticeship Council has been established. The Council is enterprise led and have representatives from business, trade unions, further and higher education bodies.  The first meeting of the Council took place on 18 November. The first job of work of the new Apprenticeship Council is to make a call for proposals from industry for new apprenticeships. This call for proposals is expected to be made before the end of 2014.</p></reply>

It provides for applications to be brought by the spouse or children of survivors who would have qualified as applicants and who died after 11th May 1999.  It also provides that where an applicant dies after making an application but before the Board has made a determination, the surviving spouse or children can proceed with the application.  In these situations the Board must direct that the award is paid to the personal representative of the deceased survivor.  The section was amended in 2005 to provide for situations where an applicant dies after the Board has made an award but prior to the applicant deciding whether to accept or reject the award.  In this circumstance a surviving spouse or child can proceed with the matter or where there is no surviving spouse or child, the applicant is deemed to have accepted the award and the Board will direct that it is paid to the personal representative of the applicant.</p><p>  I have no plans to amend these provisions.

These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works. The current practice is to use a guideline of 80m&sup2; as the standard size for a general primary school classroom. This space allows for the inclusion of two en-suite toilets and in room storage. In the case of existing schools and given the limitations of existing buildings, site conditions and funding availability, it is not always possible to achieve the level of accommodation that is provided with a new school design. For example, ensuring the availability of sufficient playground space can be much more difficult particularly in town and city locations. However, such limitations can often be addressed through the use of a school's general purpose room together with the arranging of access to local community facilities and amenities.</p><p>  The Government's focus in recent years has been on operating a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis. My main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system. We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect existing pupil teacher ratios. There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before. There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p></reply>

General purpose grants are a contribution, from my Department, towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers.  2015 will see the ending of the General Purpose Grant payments and the introduction of Local Property Tax (LPT) being paid to local authorities through the Local Government Fund.</p><p>  The amount to be paid to local authorities from the Local Government Fund for general purpose grants in 2014 recognises the removal of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water. The general purpose grant allocations to County Councils in 2014 are &ldquo;county at large&rdquo; allocations in respect of the County Council and any former Borough or Town Councils within the county.</p><p>  Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government has decided that no local authority will receive less income from LPT in 2015 than they received from the Local Government Fund in 2014. Certain local authorities, with stronger property bases, will receive greater levels of funding from local retention of LPT in 2015 than they received from the Local Government Fund in 2014.</p><p>  My Department has advised local authorities of their provisional Local Property Tax allocations from the Local Government Fund for 2015. 80% of LPT will be retained locally to fund vital public services in 2015. The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.</p><p>  Local authorities also had the power to vary LPT rates by up to 15% for 2015 before 30 September 2014; a decision to reduce rates will result in a reduction in LPT allocation to that local authority for 2015 to the value of the tax income foregone.</p></reply>

The Housing Assistance Payment (Section 50) Regulations 2014 provide for the application of Part 4 of the 2014 Act from 15 September 2014 by Cork County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council in respect of all classes of qualified household. The Housing Assistance Payment (Section 50) (No. 2) Regulations 2014 provide for its application in Kilkenny, Louth, Monaghan and South Dublin County Councils in respect of all classes of qualified household from 1 October 2014. </p><p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, I have directed the seven housing authorities taking part in the first phase of the statutory pilot for implementation of HAP, to ensure that HAP recipients, during this phase, can be afforded access to other forms of social housing support, via existing transfer lists, if that is their choice.</p><p>  I have also directed that for those HAP recipients who come directly off the waiting list and into HAP, who apply to go on the transfer list immediately, the transfer list should reflect the specific priority that that household had on the main waiting list within the authority area in which they are resident. That is they should retain the time they spent on the waiting list, once on the transfer list, and therefore be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.</p><p>  My Department is currently undertaking a review of overall allocations policy which will include the development of a standardised transfer policy.

The Panel met on several occasions since then to consider and approve the terms of reference for comprehensive, route specific studies and reports of fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects. The studies and reports are required to include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The terms of reference for the works to be carried out were published in May and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  EirGrid will either undertake or commission the necessary work in accordance with those terms of reference set by the Panel. In due course, the Panel will provide an opinion to me on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports and will oversee the publication by EirGrid of the two studies and reports prior to EirGrid proceeding to public consultation on the two projects. The Panel expects to be in a position to provide an opinion to me on the Grid West project in Q1 2015. An opinion on the Grid Link project is expected in Q3 2015. </p><p>  In relation to the Grid25 Strategy, the overall strategy was forecast to cost up to &euro;4 billion at its launch in 2007. EirGrid reviews all projects and strategies at regular intervals to take into account relevant developments including economic conditions and electricity demand forecasts. In 2010, a review of Grid25 resulted in EirGrid reducing the estimated cost of the programme to &euro;3.2 billion. EirGrid is currently undertaking a further review which it expects to complete in Q1 2015.</p></reply>

Enhanced security of supply, increased competitiveness, ability to integrate greater quantities of renewable generation resources and development of a significant renewable energy export industry are the potential benefits of further interconnection. </p><p>  In the context of achieving a fully functioning and connected internal energy market, measures are expected to be taken at EU and member state levels to increase electricity interconnections between EU member states by 2020. These measures will be pursued through the implementation of EU &quot;Projects of Common Interest&quot; (PCIs).</p><p>  In June 2013, EirGrid and its French counterpart, RTE (R&eacute;seau de transport d&rsquo;&eacute;lectricit&eacute;) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to commission studies on the feasibility of building a submarine electricity interconnector between Ireland and France. Pre-feasibility studies to investigate a possible interconnector took place between 2011 and 2013. The studies will involve desktop studies and marine survey studies to collect data to inform a decision on the feasibility and possible benefits of such an interconnector. If, on completion of the studies, the project is deemed viable, both partners would then decide on progression to the planning and development stages. The project is on the current list of PCIs adopted by the European Commission.</p></reply>

Currently, this is a 'straight-to-court' offence which attracts 5 penalty points on conviction. The change to that position that I will be implementing shortly - by commencing section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 - is to bring this offence within the Fixed Charge Payment System so that persons will have the option of receiving 3 penalty points on payment of the Fixed Charge rather than automatically being required to go to court.    </p><p>  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of the National Car Test.</p><p>  I am advised that any car owner will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days.  I understand that, in order to meet this standard, in some cases, the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found. In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale.  However, if a slot is not found within 28 days, the test should be offered free of charge.</p><p>  Also, to further facilitate demand, an NCT may now be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the test due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system is in place to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires. The RSA has run a significant advertising campaign since September to highlight this.</p><p>  The RSA informs me that it is in a favourable position to deal with current demand and that the NCTS has been testing record numbers of vehicles to date in 2014.</p></reply>

It has also held 2 public consultation meetings in Thurles and Dublin. I met with the group on 12 November last, when I conveyed to it the contents of the outline 2016 Commemoration programme.  <br/><br/>The outline programme includes a series of commemorative events in Arbour Hill on Easter Saturday, and in Kilmainham Gaol and O'Connell Street on Easter Sunday. A commemorative event will also be held in Arbour Hill on Sunday 24 April 2016.<br/><br/>A widespread public consultation process is due to commence shortly, in order to encourage and facilitate the involvement of ground-up initiatives in the wider commemorative programme.  I will be presenting the ideas and recommendations arising from this process to the Group for their advice in due course.</p></reply>
