These associated plantations were destroyed on a precautionary basis. Out of a total of 59 findings in forestry plantations, all were privately owned apart from one Coillte site.  Infected ash has also been destroyed in privately owned non-forestry locations such as horticultural nurseries, gardens and farm /agri-environment plantings. There have also been findings in ash planted along roadsides which have been subject to eradication measures.In relation to ash planted under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme the data is not available specifically for ash trees. We do know however, that 23 cases of Chalara have been found on <i>Farm planting/Agri-environment sites</i>.  With regard to hedgerows I can confirm that 4 cases of infection in hedgerows have been identified, all of which are associated with sites planted with infected imported material. </p></reply>

In this regard, I have requested Teagasc to undertake an appropriate cost benefit analysis of the impact of the introduction of an IBR control/eradication programme in Ireland. This analysis will cover a number of areas, including (i) the costs associated with the loss of the live export trade in calves and weanling to EU markets and (ii) the on-farm losses associated with reduced output on farms.  I am hopeful that this study will be completed in 2015. In view of the importance attached to the live export trade, Animal Health Ireland has developed a series of information leaflets providing veterinary practitioners, farmers and their advisers with up to date information on IBR and its control. I would urge all concerned to adopt the advice in this leaflet with a view to minimising the impact of this disease.</p></reply>

The ranking system itself has not changed &ndash; it remains the case that Tier 1 receives priority over Tier 2 and Tier 2 over Tier 3.  The Terms and Conditions of the Scheme have always made specific reference to the use of selection criteria in the ranking process and the most recent communications, which were included in a circular to all advisors, simply makes it clear that for Tranche 1 <i>their use will be confined to Tier 3 applications</i>.  This is the minimum required under the terms of the agreed Rural Development Programme.</p><p>The selection criteria in question are included in the RDP and were discussed with the RDP Monitoring Committee some weeks ago, which includes representatives of the various stakeholder interests.  I am happy that what has been proposed is both fair and proportionate. I do not accept that it lays an undue burden upon applicants or their advisers: in that regard, my Department has provided all advisers with a ready reckoner to allow them to predict the scores for the various applications they have prepared very quickly. This will allow them to confirm that each exceeds the required pass-mark and will also help them decide whether they should make any changes before submission.  For example, the selection of key actions that guarantee promotion from Tier 3 to Tier 2 is an established and well-recognised feature of GLAS, and one which both the Department and the Minister have consistently encouraged as a means of significantly increasing the probability of selection in this Tranche.</p><p>As we approach the closing date for GLAS it is important that farmers and their advisors critically review their applications to ensure that the best possible projects are presented to the Department.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-14a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051400038#WRA01400"><p>My Department has been in communication with the European Commission on this subject since September of last year. The unequivocal advice we have received from them is that a recreational fishery for bluefin tuna is not legally possible in the absence of a national bluefin tuna quota. We do not have such a quota and it is extremely unlikely that we could obtain one as it would involve reducing the share of the Total Allowable Catch of those Member States that do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery. There would be no support from any quarter for any action by Ireland that might lead to an increase in bluefin mortality.  The only possible option remaining would be a tag and release programme that would not impact on mortality and would contribute to the overall scientific knowledge of this species. A case would have to be made in the first instance at EU level and only if successful there could it be pursued with ICCAT. Even the most scientifically robust case will be difficult to progress at EU level given the sensitivities around this stock, with those Member States for whom this is an important commercial fishery completely opposed to any activity that could even possibly impact on the stock.   </p>  <p>  Consequently, careful consideration needs to be given to how a case can be put together to, in the first instance, reassure our EU colleagues that there would not be any negative impact on the stock. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who have responsibility for angling, are currently examining the proposal from the Irish Big Game Angling Association and I look forward to hearing their views. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with DCENR and relevant stakeholders on this matter to consider who would be in a position to undertake the detailed work required to prepare a case on how a possible tag and release scheme might work in practice which will need to cover issues such as the possible scope of the scheme in terms of seasons and numbers, how fish are handled etc.</p></reply>

Its April 2015 report &ndash; &lsquo;<i>A Study of the Current and Future Skills Requirements of the Marine/Maritime Economy to 2020&rsquo;,</i>notes that in the seafood sector in particular, the workforce is ageing and this will present a skills difficulty unless measures are put in place to attract and upskill younger workers.  On 27 March 2015, I announced plans for a new &euro;241 million development programme for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020, co-funded by the EU through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. A public consultation on the draft Programme closed on 1 May 2015 and I am now working to finalise the Programme with a view to bringing the Programme to Government shortly for approval.<i>Through Food Harvest 2020 and this new Seafood Development Programme, I am targeting growth of the seafood industry to &euro;1 billion by 2020, with growth in employment of 3,000 to 14,000 people employed in our coastal communities.</i></p><p><i>The draft Programme recognised the ageing profile of fishermen in particular and more generally recognised the need for tailored supports for new entrants and for supports for training and advice. The draft Programme proposed a New Fishermen Scheme to provide aid to new entrants to purchase their first fishing vessel and a New Farmers Scheme for new aquaculture enterprises to provide aid for start-up capital investment. It also proposed a special scheme of training for the aquaculture sector and the final Programme will provide for similar training for fishermen. Of course BIM has been providing training to new entrants to the seafood sector for many years, including training for the fishing, aquaculture and processing sectors</i>.</p><p>In relation to the New Farmers Scheme, this is a new initiative included in the draft Seafood Development Programme and has not previously operated. The draft Programme makes no reference to any cap of &euro;25,000 on the level of support that will be provided through the Scheme. I have not yet made any decision on the detail of that new Scheme, which will in any event require to be approved by the Monitoring Committee of stakeholders to be established under the Programme.</p></reply>

The main products involved are strawberries, lettuce and tomatoes.  Crops which have lower energy and capital requirements, such as lettuce and, in particular, strawberries, continue to expand. </p>  <p>  Crops, like tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, which require more sophisticated growing facilities and higher energy requirements have remained relatively static over the past few years. These crops are also subject to intense competition from imports.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to support the sector through the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector. This scheme is intended to assist development of the horticulture sector by grant aiding capital investments in specialised plant and equipment as well as emerging technologies specific to commercial horticulture production. The Scheme aims to facilitate environmentally friendly practices, promote the diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products and improve working conditions.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, approvals of grant aid, totalling &euro;5.7m, issued to 158 applicants; this has the potential to support capital investments exceeding &euro;14m.

Badgers are removed in accordance with the conditions of a licence issued by the Department, Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under the 1976 Wildlife Act which requires that the total area under capture is maintained below 30% of agricultural area in the country. Approximately 6,000 badgers are culled annually by trained contractors and the process is monitored and supervised by Department staff. Research conducted within UCD has shown that damage or injury to captured badgers is absent or minimal and is lower than with other capture methodologies. Finally, I should point out that the Council of Europe has found that Ireland&rsquo;s badger population is not being threatened by the removal programme. </p>  <p>  In tandem with the badger removal programme, my Department continues to sponsor research and trials into developing a vaccination programme to control Tuberculosis in badgers, thus improving the overall health status of that species, and breaking the infection link to cattle. The research to date has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against bovine TB. Current research is aimed at confirming that such a protective effect holds true in the wild population.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s ultimate objective is to incorporate badger vaccination into the TB eradication programme when data is available to ensure that it can be incorporated in an optimally effective and sustainable manner. A number of field trials are ongoing with this objective in mind, but it is anticipated that it will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term in the interests of ensuring that the progress achieved in recent years in combating TB in cattle is maintained.</p>  <p>  It is also notable that there has been a significant improvement in the disease situation in Ireland both in the cattle and badger populations since the badger removal programme was put on a more structured footing in 2004. The incidence of TB in cattle has fallen by almost 40% since 2008 and is currently at record low levels. It is particularly interesting that the incidence of TB in Northern Ireland, where badger removal is not practised, is approximately twice as high as on this side of the Border.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that there are also a significant number of businesses, particularly restaurants, operating in the Harbour. With that in mind my Department is anxious to increase the profile of the Harbour for the betterment of the wider community.</p>  <p>  My Department engages and co-operates with Fingal County Council on an ongoing basis in regard to issues of joint interest in Howth. In the context of the Council&rsquo;s Public Realm Consultation Process, the Harbour Master for Howth attended the Public Consultation Participatory Workshop on 22nd  October 2014 organised by the Council.

The current Safety Scheme has been designed to overcome some of the particular hazards which may be present on farms. A total of &euro;12.2m has been allocated to this scheme offering a 40 per cent rate of aid, up to a maximum eligible investment ceiling of &euro;20,000, i.e. a maximum grant of &euro;8,000. As this scheme was introduced under the 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme, very tight time-limits are applicable as far as the completion of work by farmers is concerned. All work must be completed by farmers and a payment claim lodged with the Department by the 31st August 2015. There can be no extension to this deadline.  A total of   6,299 applications for aid were received before the final closing date in January.</p>  <p>  Over 3,100 approvals to proceed with proposed investments have already issued to applicants and the remaining applications continue to be processed to approval stage, as appropriate, on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Processing of the applications for the Farm Safety Scheme involves a series of checks, including checking of farm building sketches to ensure that no internal slurry agitation points, which are a major safety concern, exist in buildings where investments are planned. This is a time-consuming exercise and the quality of many of the sketch-plans submitted has been poor. However, this is an extremely important check to make and where the plans submitted are not clear, my Department&rsquo;s officials have been contacting farmers individually to clarify the situation on the ground.</p>  <p>  There has been no undue delay in processing applications and I am very pleased with the progress made by my Department in the issuing of approvals for what has proved, and rightly so, a very popular scheme among farmers.</p></reply>

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.  Eligibility checks, including checks on the eligibility of land declared for aid, must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants. My Department has made every effort to respond to concerns about the impact of on-the-ground inspections on farmers and arising from this some 85% of these inspections are initially carried out <b>without the need for a farm visit,</b>as the information needed is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite. </p><p>The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is a minimum of 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural Environmental Condition (GAEC) standards apply. However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep/goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.</p><p>These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.6 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances. The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements.</p><p>My Department continuously reviews the inspection process to take account of changes in the governing regulations and also to reflect comments and findings contained in the various audit reports. Inspecting officers in my Department are regularly trained in inspection procedures, with a process of continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification inspections to ensure a consistent approach. In addition, the Inspection Unit participates fully at various meetings and workshops organised by the European Commission, where Commission experts and experts from other EU member states share their knowledge. In this way the Inspection Unit has and continues to build up extensive corporate knowledge on inspection requirements. This ensures that the EU regulatory requirements are being fully met and also that the training of the inspecting officers on inspection procedures is kept up-to-date.</p><p>As part of the current consideration of CAP simplification at EU level Ireland has proposed a rationalisation of the inspection regime. Other Member States have done likewise and we hope that progress can be made on this issue when the Commission comes forward with its final simplification proposals in the Autumn.</p></reply>

However, annual round testing of animals, restriction of affected herds and removal of reactors will continue to be central elements of the Programme. </p>  <p>  The Programme has delivered considerable success, particularly in recent years, with, for example, numbers of reactors in 2014 at virtually half the levels of 2008. In the same period, herd incidence of TB has fallen from 5.9% to 3.6% and has continued to decline further in the current year to 2.5%. This has already brought significant benefits to farmers due to a significant reduction in the number of herds being restricted with, for example 2,700 fewer herds restricted in 2014 compared with 2008.</p>  <p>  The reduction in the incidence of the disease reflects the fruits of the various improvements which have progressively been made to various elements of the Programme in recent years, including the badger removal programme which was put in place a decade ago in its current form. The badger removal programme, while protecting the viability of the badger species, has contributed significantly to the sustained improvement in disease levels by reducing spillback from badgers to cattle. The Deputy may be aware that my Department plans to replace the current badger removal programme with a vaccination programme as soon as possible and research and field trials are being conducted to make this a reality.</p>  <p>  As I have said earlier, the TB eradication programme is subject to on-going review, including by the EU Commission who provide significant funding towards the programme. Our objective in any review is to make the TB Programme more effective with a view to bringing disease levels down further and driving on towards the goal of eradication. We must draw from lessons learned in other areas, for example, brucellosis, where sustained focus on problem areas delivered the prize of eradication which has brought very significant savings to farmers through reductions in testing costs and trade restrictions. In this context, in light of contacts with the EU Commission and following consultations with the farming organisations, I am proposing to make some very minor changes to the testing regime which applies to herds after they have passed the clearance test. As part of the on going review process, my Department will continue to engage with the farming sector so that the positive engagement and co-operation which has delivered such encouraging outcomes over the last decade or so can continue.</p></reply>

Fertilisers (as with crude oil and gas) are mainly traded in US dollars and are thereby subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A weak euro means increased costs for fuel and fertiliser imports and this has impacted on recent price trends.</p>  <p>  Currently, Europe is only 80% self-sufficient in fertiliser production and must import 20% of its requirements. As such, European and Irish fertiliser prices are strongly linked to global prices and heavily influenced by supply and demand.</p>  <p>  With global demand outstripping supply, Irish fertiliser prices have increased by 6-8% so far in 2015. It is anticipated that world demand will continue to increase into the future maintaining upward pressure on prices to the final consumer in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I understand that the issue of price of fertilisers is an important issue for farmers and the advice from Teagasc is for farmers to keep in contact with merchants as prices often spike at periods of high demand when European order books are full. Purchasing fertilisers at off-peak periods will help minimise prices.</p></reply>

The rules on origin labelling are determined at EU level and I recently signed into law an SI to give effect to the new European Regulations for country of origin labelling of meat from sheep, pigs, poultry and goats.   These mandatory rules require a label to state the Member State where the animal was reared and slaughtered. They do not operate on a regional, multi member state or all-island basis.</p>  <p>  The requirement at EU level applies only to prepackaged meat.   However, I believe this information should also be made available to consumers purchasing meat sold loose through butcher shops and deli counters. As a result, I have asked my officials to work with the Department of Health to extend these rules to &ldquo;loose meat   &rdquo; and work is progressing well in bringing this to fruition.</p>  <p>  With regards to Northern Ireland , I have been in regular contact with my counterpart Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill on labelling issues that affect bot h jurisdictions on the island.</p>  <p>  There is also considerable engagement at official level and, only last week, my Department met with officials from DARD Northern Ireland to discuss the practical implementation of the new  Country of origin labelling requirements, including any impact which these may be having on the trade in lambs from Northern Ireland. It is true to say that the volume of lamb imported here from Norther n Ireland has reduced this year and while the new labelling rules may be contributing to this decline, there are a number of other factors to be considered, including the euro-sterling exchange rate and the early Easter lamb market this year. I&rsquo;m also pleased to note that sheep prices here have maintained their current levels continuing the strong prices seen in 2014. </p>  <p>  The issue with lamb this year bears many similarities to what happened last year with so called &ldquo;nomad cattle&rdquo;. These mixed origin cattle, born and reared in the South and subsequently slaughtered in the North, were less attractive to UK retailers that   have a preference for labelling a single Member State on their beef products. At the time, this was considered to be having a knock on effect on cattle sales at marts in the South, and Minister O&rsquo;Neill and I engaged intensively with processors and retailers in an effort to facilitate the continuation of these traditional trade flows.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, these issues are a function of the market and are driven by customer specification. This is borne out by the fact that live export of beef animals to the North is nearly 50% higher than it was at this time last year and this has been achieved without any change to the beef labelling rules . This shows that a true picture of the market forces impacting on the market takes time to become apparent and the situation for lamb this year is no different, particularly since the new rules have only been introduced from 1   April. </p>  <p>Of course, it is important that we continue to monitor the impact of labelling rules carefully. I will continue to work to ensure that mandatory labelling laws provide clear and transparent information to consumers, are practicable, and do not negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood exports.</p></reply>

We have significant offensive interests in relation to the agrifood sector. We are keen to increase our access to the American market for dairy products, pig-meat, beverages and food ingredients. Now that we have gained access to the US beef market, we want to grow that trade by securing higher quotas and lower tariffs. A TTIP agreement has the potential to facilitate all of this through the reduction of import tariffs and the removal of trade barriers.  Of course we have defensive interests as well. One of these is our beef sector where we are mindful of the potential of increased imports of US beef to have a negative effect on the economics of EU and Irish beef production, particularly beef from suckler cows. We must ensure that the EU market is not undermined by over-supply and our proposals to mitigate the impact of quotas and tariff cuts are well known to the Commission. These defensive interests should be seen in the light of the current high US beef prices which at least temporarily reduce the US competitive advantage, and the recent opening of the US market to Irish beef, with the favourable prospects for capitalising on this through TTIP by further reductions in beef tariffs and the opening of a quota for the EU.</p></reply>

My Department maintains an environment in which live exports can continue in an economic and sustainable manner with due regard for the welfare of animals. In this context, Ireland has a comprehensive legislative framework in place for some time to ensure that vessels authorised for the carriage of livestock by sea are designed and fitted out in a manner which ensures the welfare of the animals. My Department operates a strict licensing system in respect of ships who undertake this trade and continues to work closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE) to ensure that welfare standards are raised internationally.  The OIE is the intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide.  Live exports are a vital component of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry and provide alternative market outlets for certain categories of livestock, thereby serving a market demand and providing increased competition in the market place for cattle. My Department has no jurisdiction in relation to standards of slaughter plants in other countries. However, it does support ongoing efforts by the OIE, to improve welfare standards at slaughter plants worldwide.<b></b></p><p>I should also point out that, should live exports from Ireland or the EU to third countries be banned, it would not necessarily mean that exports of cattle to that country would cease. Sourcing would take place elsewhere, and could involve the shipment of cattle under conditions less exacting than those existing under Irish law.</p></reply>

It also covers administrative costs associated with the operation of each group. The facilitator payment totals &euro;500 per farmer per year. This payment has been independently verified and reflects the emphasis on the individual time the facilitator will be required to spend with each farmer under this measure. Together with facilitating a minimum of 5 knowledge exchange meetings per group, facilitators will be required to spend a total of 12 hours over the period of the programme directly engaging with each individual farmer in completing and updating the Farm Improvement Plan. </p>  <p>From a farmer perspective the funding covers the time spent attending meetings and preparing the Farm Improvement Plan as well as travel costs associated with attending each meeting.

It is an attractive option for extensive farmers who may choose up to 10 hectares at a payment rate of &euro;314 per hectare. As with all options under GLAS, farmers are required to respect the management requirements set out in the detailed GLAS specifications accompanying the Scheme, and any other instructions or clarifications issued by the Department.  In the case of Low Input Permanent Pasture this means that heather cannot be present in the area selected for the delivery of this action. The Low Input Permanent Pasture specification is quite detailed in terms of a restriction in chemical Nitrogen application to 40kg per hectare per annum, the selection of suitable pasture(s) which contain less than 30% ryegrass, along with at least four other <b><i>grass </i></b>species that are dispersed throughout the parcel. Heather is not a grass species. </p><p>In addition, the parcels must also have been declared as forage for the last 8 years on the GLAS applicants SPS. There are also other restrictions in terms of cutting hay/silage and specific topping dates. These conditions are aimed at ensuring suitable Low Input Permanent Pastures receive payment in GLAS based on income foregone and costs incurred in accordance with EU Regulation 1305/2013.</p></reply>

A person on rent supplement who is deemed by a local authority to be Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) eligible may engage in full-time employment and retain their entitlement subject to satisfying the means test.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Payments under the HAP scheme will be based on the local authority differential rent means test under which the full-time employment restriction does not apply and therefore will remove a key barrier to persons on social welfare in getting back to work. HAP is currently in operation in seven local authority areas in which there are approximately 1,800 HAP tenancies already in place. There are plans to roll out HAP to 12 further local authorities during 2015, commencing in Donegal at the end of May.  There is a target to achieve 8,400 HAP cases in 2015 as set out in the &lsquo;Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department continue to work closely with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and housing authorities to ensure the success of the HAP scheme.</p></reply>

The Department implements strict governance procedures in the procurement of such services.</p><p>The majority of expenditure on consultancy expertise is to support the Department in implementing a multi-annual service delivery modernisation and transformation programme involving business process, organisational and technological change.  These programmes are supported by the procurement of separate external development services (IT external service provision) as well as engagement of consultants to provide strategic technical advice.

It was in this context that the decision was taken to reduce the amount of the grant, and any decision regarding the future rate of the grant would have to be taken in the context of overall Budget considerations.</p>  <p>  However, it is worth making the point that the rate of the respite care grant at &euro;1,375 is still more than twice what it was in 2002 when it was &euro;635, and higher than it was in 2006 at the height of the economic boom, when it was &euro;1,200.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that such an annual payment - in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test - is not available for any other group nor indeed is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe. </p></reply>

The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.   </p>  <p>  Where the travel costs are non-recurring, the SWA scheme provides for exceptional needs payments to be made to assist with essential, once-off expenditure in exceptional circumstances.

Again, every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-14a.162.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051400042#WRE01000"><p>I am conscience of the importance of encouraging the availability of land to younger farmers, and this is an issue which was given great emphasis during last year's Agri-Taxation Review.  A number of policies have been enacted or modified for this purpose in recent years, several of them emerging out of the Agri-Taxation Review. Included among these are the following:</p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax</b></p><p><b>Farm Restructuring Relief</b></p><p>The Finance Act 2013 introduced relief from capital gains tax for farm restructuring where the first transaction in the restructuring, for example, the sale, purchase or exchange of farm land, was carried out on or before 31 December 2015 and where the restructuring was completed within 24 months.  The Finance Act 2014 extended this deadline to 31 December 2016.  However, in order to comply with EU State aid requirements, the relief is now confined to agricultural land only it does not apply to buildings on the land.  The purpose of the relief is to facilitate the consolidation of farm land, thereby ensuring the more productive use of the consolidated land holding.</p><p><b>Retirement Relief</b></p><p>Section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 grants CGT retirement relief to farmers in respect of, among other things, the disposal of landincluding land that has been let in certain circumstances.</p><p>In the case of land that is let, the Agri-Taxation Review recommended subject to certain conditions, that land that has been let for up to 25 years in total (increased from 15 years) ending with the disposal of that land should qualify for the relief.  The Finance Act 2014 gave effect to this recommendation.  The letting can be to an individual, a partnership or a company.</p><p>Since the enactment of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, farmers who let their land on conacre agreements were not eligible for retirement relief when the land was ultimately disposed of, except where the disposal was to a child (which includes a child of a deceased child, nephews and nieces and foster children in certain circumstances) of the person disposing of the land.  The Finance Act 2014 gives farmers who let their land on conacre and who ultimately dispose of their land a once-off opportunity to avail of CGT retirement relief, provided they satisfy the other conditions of the relief, where they either:</p><p>- dispose of their land on or before 31 December 2016, or</p><p>- lease their land on or before 31 December 2016 for minimum periods of 5 years (up to a maximum of 25 years) and ultimately dispose of the land.</p><p>An overriding condition in relation to eligibility for retirement relief is that the land ultimately disposed of must have been owned and farmed by the retiring farmer for a period of not less than ten years immediately before the land is leased (or let on conacre up to 31 December 2016).  A farmer who ultimately disposes of the land to his or her child (as defined) can let the land on conacre after 31 December 2016, pending that disposal, without losing eligibility for retirement relief.  The changes outlined above are designed to encourage the long-term leasing of farm land and the transfer of that land to young, progressive farmers.</p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax</b></p><p>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is the overall name for both Gift Tax and Inheritance Tax.</p><p>CAT relief is available in respect of gifts and inheritances of agricultural property, as defined in Section 89(1) Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.</p><p>The relief operates by reducing the value of the agricultural property by 90%.</p><p>The relief has been amended in the Finance Act 2014 to take account of the recent recommendations of the Agri-Taxation Review, designed to ensure productive use of agricultural property.</p><p>In order for a beneficiary of a gift or an inheritance to qualify for Agricultural relief on a gift or inheritance of agricultural property taken on or after 1 January 2015, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance must farm the agricultural property on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits for a period of not less than six years or alternatively, lease the agricultural property to a lessee who will farm the agricultural property on a commercial basis.</p><p>The focus of the changes to CAT Agricultural relief in Finance Act 2014 is to target agricultural relief to active farmers and to thereby ensure that agricultural land is used productively when it is the subject of a transfer by way of either gift or inheritance.</p><p><b>Stamp Duty</b></p><p><b>Leasing farm land</b></p><p>One of the recommendations of the Agri-taxation Review intended to encourage more productive use of farm land is that stamp duty relief be given in relation to certain leases of farm land to encourage more productive use of land.  This recommendation is now reflected in Section 81D of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 which was introduced in the Finance Act 2014 and is subject to a commencement order by myself.</p><p>The section provides, subject to certain conditions, for relief from stamp duty to encourage the long-term leasing of farm land to active farmers.</p><p>The conditions that must be satisfied are:</p><p>- The term of a lease must be for a period of not less than 6 years and not more than 35 years.</p><p>- The land must be used exclusively for farming carried on by the lessee.</p><p>- The land must be farmed on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profitsthus confining the relief to genuine farmers.</p><p>The lessee (be it an individual, partners or a main shareholder and working director) must also:</p><p>- have an agricultural qualification (a qualification of the kind listed in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999), or farm the land for not less than 50% of his or her normal working time.</p><p><b>Consanguinity Relief (Paragraph 5, Schedule 1 to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999)</b></p><p>Conveyances and transfers of certain properties between close relatives were subject to stamp duty at one-half the normal rate of stamp duty.  The reduced stamp duty was payable by the individual to whom the land is conveyed or transferred.  This relief is commonly known as consanguinity relief and was due to expire in relation to instruments executed prior to 1 January 2015.</p><p>The Agri-taxation Review recommended that this stamp duty relief be extended for three more years but confined to conveyances or transfers of farm land, in order to encourage more productive use of farmland.</p><p>Between 1 January and 31 December 2015, a conveyance or transfer by a person of any age can qualify for relief.  Between 1 January 2016 and before 1 January 2018, only a conveyance or transfer by a person under 67 years of age can qualify for relief.  The individual to whom the land is conveyed or transferred must either farm the land or lease it for a period of not less than six years to an individual who farms the land. Revenue will accept that a lease may also be to a partnership or to a company (whose main shareholder and working director farms the land on behalf of the company).  [Where land is leased to a company that is owned equally by an individual and that individual's spouse or civil partner, and at least one of them satisfies the working director and the farming requirements, the relief will apply.]</p><p>The person who farms the land (including partners or working director as appropriate) must be a farmer with an agricultural qualification (a qualification of the kind listed in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999) or farm the land for not less than 50% of his or her normal working time.</p><p>The land must be farmed on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits, thus confining the relief to genuine farmers.</p><p>These various policies are designed to maximise the extent to which younger farmers have access to land.  I have no immediate plans for further policies to encourage the sale of land and it would not be appropriate to speculate on the issue in advance of the Budget process.</p></reply>

While most Member states apply the standard rate to construction services, Ireland has historically applied the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive.  This derogation is only permissible where the VAT rate applying is 12% or greater.  Accordingly, it is not legally possible to introduce a 9% rate of VAT on non-residential construction services.  Having said that, it is possible to apply the 9% VAT rate to the construction of residential properties, but as I have said before this would involve having two separate VAT rates applying to construction services, would be difficult to administer and could lead to underpayment of VAT.  Accordingly, I have no plans to apply different rates to construction services.</p></reply>

The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. Following revaluation there generally will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy. </p>  <p>  Section 9(10) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative. Section 19(1) of the said Act empowers the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the rating authority concerned, to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted. </p>  <p>  The revaluation programme which began with South Dublin County Council, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas has been rolled out more recently to the Dublin City Council area, Waterford City and County Council area and Limerick City and County Council area. The statutory consultation process, required before a valuation order can be made, is now being conducted in relation to a further three rating authorities, Galway City Council, Kilkenny County Council and Carlow County Council. While the Commissioner is exploring a number of initiatives to accelerate the programme, he cannot at present give a date for the commencement of the revaluation of all commercial properties in County Kerry or in other rating authority areas. In the meantime, commercial properties in the county will continue to be valued on the existing valuation lists by reference to the valuation levels prevailing on those lists. </p>  <p>  The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 was recently passed by the Oireachtas. The primary purpose of the Act is to accelerate the national revaluation programme and it contains a number of measures in this regard. Firstly, provision is being made to enable the Commissioner to enter into an arrangement with persons, other than his officers, to assist in the performance of the revaluation function. The effect of this provision is to allow the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. The Commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources. The Act also provides for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation with the assistance of the occupiers of property using elements of self-assessment. This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and I understand that the Commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise certain principles of self-assessment.</p></reply>

Public Procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they must now operate.</p>  <p>  However, I would point out that reforms in this area are being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs.  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  Circular 10/14 issued in 2014 by my Department sets out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises as well as highlighting practices that are to be avoided because they can hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts. The main thrust of the circular is as follows:</p>  <p>  - buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs, etc.</p>  <p>  - the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders;</p>  <p>  - it encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities;</p>  <p>  - buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers where possible;</p>  <p>  - promotes greater use of "open" tendering and less use of "restrictive" tendering;</p>  <p>  - it  encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition; and,</p>  <p>  - it encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so and where it does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.</p>  <p>  The OGP proactively launched a campaign to get more businesses to register with e-tenders (the national tendering portal) which resulted in 12,300 new supplier registrations in 2014.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is working with industry representative bodies to promote the engagement of Irish business in public procurement (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland.  Last year, for example, the OGP supported two 'Meet the Buyer' events - one in Belfast and the other in Dublin attended by over 1,100 businesses. The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

These site visits may take place at the beginning or end of the process and in some cases there are no site visits involved.  Site visits, when they do occur, involve new companies visiting a location for the first time and senior executives of existing companies.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, IDA Ireland does not comment publicly on the success rate of such site visits.</p>  <p>  While these site visits contribute to investment approvals and the creation of jobs, there is not always a direct correlation between site visits made and jobs created in any given year.  It is important also to acknowledge the natural time lag between a decision being made to invest and that investment coming on stream.  The time lag can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and the recruitment and training of suitable staff.</p>  <p>  The level of investment coming on stream is best captured in the number of jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Annual Employment Survey which shows that at the end of 2014 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry with total employment of 1,874.  County Kerry has seen an annual increase in FDI related employment over the past three consecutive years from 1,497 in 2011 to 1,874 in 2014.</p>  <p>  Kerry has traditionally established itself as a centre for foreign manufacturing companies but has seen a number of downsizings/closures in recent years.  It has however attracted a number of services companies (e.g. JRI America, Enercon, etc.) and has a strong cluster of well-established indigenous companies.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.</p>  <p>  The reinstatement of Regional Aid for Kerry with effect from 1 July 2014 under the new Regional Aid Guidelines will also be beneficial to the county.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, officials of my Department and its agencies are actively engaged with regional stakeholders in the development of individual Action Plans for each of the regions, including the South West Region, which will be published in the near future.  Counties Kerry and Cork make up the South West Region.</p></reply>

Tralee is one of the locations chosen for the 2015 investment programme with others scheduled to follow in subsequent years.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the facility to be constructed in Tralee, I am informed by IDA Ireland that the Agency is currently in the process of appointing a design team for the facility and is finalising the specific site location for the new building development. </p>  <p>  This is a positive development for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into regional locations in particular, allowing these locations to compete more aggressively with competitor locations internationally. It will also give regional locations access to modern, turnkey property solutions, which when combined with a strong local talent pool and existing FDI cluster, will give these locations an enhanced proposition to offer international investors.</p></reply>

Having Fexco which employs approximately 850 people is the real source of this success.</p>  <p>  The employment performance in Killorglin is down to the overall calibre and number of successful companies based in the town, some of which have been in the town for decades and is complemented in turn by a number of other companies, some of which are spin-outs of Fexco. </p>  <p>  It is to be welcomed that Fexco, one of the most successful indigenous financial services companies, started in the town over twenty years ago and has remained there, and that a number of other local businesses have thrived on the back of good economic activity generated by this company.  The two IDA Pharma Companies in the town, i.e. Astellas and Temmler also play a significant role. There is also a number of engineering companies which have been based in the area for twenty years. </p>  <p>  In promoting Kerry as a location for investment, IDA Ireland relies strongly on the success of reference companies - both overseas and indigenous in a region to promote it as a location to prospective investors.  In the case of Kerry, the Agency actively includes reference companies including Astellas, Temmler and Fexco. In addition, other companies throughout the county are also profiled as part of efforts to promote Kerry. </p>  <p>  The retention and attraction of large numbers of young people in Killorglin and the greater Mid-Kerry area has been a major economic boost to other businesses in the area such as shops, pubs, restaurants, builders, etc., which has in turn increased overall employment. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, officials of my Department and its Agencies are actively engaged with regional stakeholders in the development of individual Regional Action Plans including the South West Region, which will be published in the near future.  Counties Kerry and Cork make up the South West Region.</p></reply>

This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the European Union. Regional Aid is also provided under Schemes for tourism grants, marine tourism, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes. All such aid comes from the Exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding. The 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines entered into force on 1 July 2014. Areas accounting for 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population are now eligible for assistance under the Regional Aid Guidelines. This represents a substantial increase from the 25% originally proposed by the Commission, and an increase from the 50% under the 2007-2013 Map. This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are now available in Kerry.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines specify the grant aid rates for Regional Aid projects. The Deputy is correct in acknowledging an improvement in the aid rate applicable for eligible projects in Kerry. This specifically relates to the aid rate for large companies, which has increased from 0% to 10% for the period 2014-2020. The Regional aid rates for Kerry and other areas designated under the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines are a maximum of 30% for small and micro enterprises, 20% for medium-sized enterprises and 10% for large enterprises. </p>  <p>  The Regional Aid Map changes which came into effect on 1 July 2014 impact on Capital and Employment support. Since July 2014, four Enterprise Ireland companies have been approved Regional Aid support, in Kerry, amounting to &euro;5,327,740 through both Capital and Employment support grants. </p>  <p>  During 2014, there were no public investment announcements of IDA Ireland projects for County Kerry. However, it should be noted that not all companies agree to announce their investments and as a result, this does not truly reflect the level of investments won or the performance of FDI in a county in a particular year. In this respect, IDA Ireland clients had a very positive employment performance in County Kerry with a net increase of 236 jobs in 2014, compared with 2013. </p>  <p>  Kerry Local Enterprise Office continues to work with its micro enterprise client base in Kerry.</p></reply>

The Natura measure provides for compensation to farmers for disadvantages in their farming activities arising out of 3 Directives &ndash; the Habitats Directive, the Wild Birds Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Under the 2007-2013 RDP, Natura 2000 forms an integral part of the REPS and AEOS agri-environment schemes and applicants with Natura designated land are prioritised under AEOS.  Participation in agri-environment schemes, including Natura, is voluntary on the part of farmers and expenditure is therefore demand led. Actual demand under the Natura measure during the 2007 &ndash; 2013 Programme proved to be significantly less than had been provided for. Therefore, the financial provision for Natura was revised to reflect the actual spend. This involved the reallocation of funds across the agri-environment and Less Favoured Areas schemes in Axis 2 of the RDP without changing the overall spend under that Axis.</p>  <p>  The members of the Rural Development Programme Monitoring Committee were informed of the proposed amendments in April 2013 and asked for observations. The issue was included on the agenda of a RDP Monitoring Committee meeting July 2013, where the issue was discussed and the amendments agreed by those present. The National Parks and Wildlife Service is a member of this Monitoring Committee. Amendments made to the Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013 were processed in full accordance with the regulatory and legislative process in place.</p>  <p>  While money was transferred from the Natura measure, it should be noted that expenditure under the agri-environment budget measures in the 2007-2013 RDP also complemented and incentivised farmers with Natura land to engage with the agri-environment scheme. In the new 2014-2020 RDP, Natura land is deemed a Priority Environmental Asset under the recently launched GLAS agri-environment scheme and thus expenditure on Natura lands will be continued and enhanced in the new programming period.</p></reply>

My Department has a dedicated Inspection Unit to undertake these inspections.  This unit interprets the governing EU regulations as they relate to inspection requirements and implements an inspection process to meet these requirements.  The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission and European Court of Auditors which ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements.

In addition, the Inspection Unit participates fully at various meetings and workshops organised by the European Commission on all inspection requirements, including land eligibility matters related to the Birds and Habitats Directives, where Commission experts and experts from other EU member states share their knowledge. In this way the Inspection Unit has and continues to build up extensive corporate knowledge on inspection requirements.

This application was successful and consequently the value of those entitlements will not be available to the person named for the purposes of calculating his new entitlement value in 2015.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the unit value of the entitlements held by the person named was &euro;118.93.  The estimated initial value of his entitlements in 2015 will be &euro;74.94.  However, the number of entitlements allocated has increased from 76 to 82 and this unit value is exclusive of the greening payment which will be added as an additional payment and is calculated as a fixed percentage of the value of the Basic Payment Scheme entitlements.</p>  <p>  In terms of payment arising from entitlements, in 2013 the person named received a total payment of &euro;9 ,928.  In 2014, having sold entitlements with a total value of over &euro;2,000, he still received a total payment of &euro;8,950.  In 2015, his estimated total payment which is inclusive of the greening payment will be &euro;9,457.10.  Through the process of convergence, this payment will increase on an annual basis so that by 2019 the person named will receive approximately &euro;12,084.45.  This represents an increase of 21.7 % between his 201 5 and 2019 payments.</p></reply>

Financial instruments are defined in the relevant EU regulation as measures of financial support provided on a complementary basis from the budget in order to address one or more policy objectives of the EU.  They may take the form of equity or quasi-equity investments, loans or guarantees, or other risk sharing instruments.  In order for any such instruments to be put in place, an ex ante assessment must first be carried out.  I have recently secured a letter of comfort in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s RDP following an extensive design and negotiation process with the EU Commission , and the RDP commits to keeping the possible use of financial instruments under review during the programming period which runs to 2020.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has been active in exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements.  The recent announcement by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland of a new product, &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo;, is a welcome addition to the sources of funding currently in the market.  This credit is available, subject to qualifying criteria, at favourable terms (i.e. longer term and lower interest rate) for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.</p>  <p>  In relation to accessing finance and credit terms generally, I have recently been in contact with the main banks.  I emphasised that this is a critical phase in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy expansion and that the increased investment and output from production and processing will have significant downstream benefits across the economy generally, including for the banking sector.  In order to support the on-going development of the dairy sector and to mitigate the current difficulties caused by milk price volatility, I asked them to explore the full range of potential measures that could serve to alleviate the loan repayment burden facing farmers and offer maximum flexibility for dairy farmers in what will be a difficult year ahead.  I believe that it is essential that short term cash flow difficulties are not allowed to undermine prudent investment plans or the longer term competitiveness of their operations.  I will continue to communicate with the main banks on issues affecting the sector.</p></reply>

The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence. The fact that producers will face a super-levy bill in relation to the final year of the system is obviously unwelcome. However, the rules governing the imposition of a super levy were set by regulations agreed at EU level. It was not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust these super levy rules.</p>  <p>  I have, on numerous occasions, proposed action at EU level to mitigate the impact of super levy, primarily through an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations. Other options previously discussed included the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, or a type of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would have operated providing overall EU production was within quota.   However, given the opposition of some Member States, it became clear as we approached the ending of the quota era in 2015, that there was no realistic prospect of any movement on the initiatives. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless flexibility has been secured from the European Commission for farmers to pay the superlevy fine on a phased basis over 3 years and my Department is finalising the details of a scheme to give effect to this measure at national level. I will announce details of how to apply for this scheme in the very near future.</p>  <p>  I have also been proactive in other areas in terms of ensuring the right balance of measures are in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence. On-going contact has been maintained with the Minister for Finance to ensure that existing and future taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture. Of interest to dairy farmers here will be the announcement in last October&rsquo;s budget to provide for income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan. In addition, I have impressed upon the Irish banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied now that this mix of measures, the worst impacts of the superlevy have been mitigated and that the dairy sector can look to the future with confidence.</p></reply>

This Article provides for agri-environment and climate change measures and requires that commitments under this measure be undertaken for a minimum period of five years. The BDGP will run for 6 years.  The scheme is an innovative, technology driven scheme which aims to bring about accelerated genomic gain in the national suckler herd, with a particular focus on the maternal efficiency traits of these animals, such as the amount of milk they produce. These maternal traits should allow our beef herd to become more environmentally sustainable.

However, there will be challenges along the way.  Nevertheless, it is independently and internationally recognised that ours is one of the most climate and resource efficient agri-food production systems in the world and we are working with all stakeholders to find even greater efficiencies.</p><p>Meeting annual mitigation targets in the second half of the 2013-2020 compliance period under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision &ndash; which does not take into account the limited cost-effective mitigation options available in the sector &ndash; will be one of the more significant challenges for the sector.  It is vital, therefore, that in terms of setting EU climate policy to 2030, there is coherence between EU agriculture and food security policy.  The October 2014 European Council Conclusions contain critical principles that recognise the multiple objectives of agriculture and the land use sector including recognition of the limited cost-effective mitigation options available. </p><p>I met with Commissioner Canete last month with a view to building upon the October Conclusions and reiterated the reality of the challenges the Irish agriculture sector faces which need to be recognised in future EU Climate and Food policies.  Officials from my Department and other Departments are applying a whole of Government approach to engagement with the Commission in order to seek an appropriate framework for agriculture within EU climate policy. </p><p>My Department has also established an agriculture climate change committee, which includes Teagasc, the EPA and Bord Bia, which is informing the development of national and EU policy in relation to agriculture and climate change. </p><p>In addition, the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan, which is being prepared under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015, will not only focus on addressing the current 2020 compliance challenge but will also look to 2030 and beyond.  My Department is developing the sectoral mitigation plan for agriculture, and this will examine how the sector can play its part.</p><p>Reduced production is not a realistic option for the Irish agriculture sector - we are committed to ensuring that the sector continues to grow sustainably so that Ireland can play its part in meeting the increasing global food demand while having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s climate obligations.</p><p>Looking to the future and further developing the industry over the next decade, a high-level committee, which I established towards the end of last year, is in the process of developing a ten-year Agri-Food strategy to 2025, which will include the impact of milk quota removal.  While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of this important work, the emphasis must be on encouraging sustainable intensification of food production in light of the growing global demand and to reduce the carbon intensity of production, to contribute to both food security and greenhouse gas mitigation objectives.</p><p>In terms of particular Food Harvest 2020 targets a recent report (Milestones for Success 2014) has found that (inter alia):</p><p>- The value of beef exports and pig outputs has already exceeded the Food Harvest 2020 targets.</p><p>- The value of sheep output has already almost reached its target.</p><p>- The value of Dairy Produce &amp;amp; Ingredients exports is more than 80% of the way to its target.</p><p>The Food Harvest 2020 Environmental Analysis (published in January 2014) contains a number of recommendations that would mitigate any slight negative impacts from increased production.  These are informing policy development to ensure sustainability in production and significant investment is being targeted to address potential negative impacts. Measures include:</p><p>- research aimed at developing and refining best practices</p><p>- investment through the Rural Development Programme and</p><p>- the identification and confirmation of sustainability credentials for Irish agricultural production.</p><p>Early analysis suggests that further efficiency improvements are possible such as the more efficient use of fertiliser and manure, grassland management, improved breeding and better fertility.  Essential ongoing research into new technologies is continuing so as to maintain our economic and environmental competitive advantages. </p></reply>

For beef, compulsory labelling rules have been in place for many years, and require food business operators to label fresh, frozen or minced beef with specific information to enable the product to be traced back to the animals from which it was derived.  This must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed, as well as the country in which it was born and reared.</p><p>In 2011 the European Union passed the Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169/2011, which is applicable to all foods intended for the final consumer and including foods delivered to mass caterers.  This Regulation has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas.  In particular, the FIC Regulation extends mandatory origin labelling to meats other than beef for the first time.  The implementing provision is Commission Regulation No. 1337/2013, which introduced mandatory origin labelling for meat from pigs, poultry, sheep and goats with effect from the 1<sup>st</sup>April 2015.  Under this regulation, <b>labelling is required to identify the Member State or third country of rearing and the Member State or third country of slaughter for these meats</b>.  The term &lsquo;<b>Origin&rsquo; can also be used where the country/member state of birth </b>is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter. </p><p>Ireland has been a strong proponent of such rules and I have signed into law a new Statutory Instrument No. 113 to ensure that the necessary provisions are in place to implement this mandatory labelling requirement in the state and a period of compliance building has now begun.  In addition, my Department is liaising with the Department of Health with a view to extending the legislation to include &ldquo;loose meats&rdquo; e.g.: meat cuts that sold through butcher counters. </p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for general food labelling legislation.  However, my Department and in the case of fish or fishery products, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, plays an important role in the labelling of food together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  Under EU law primary responsibility for the safety and traceability of food placed in the market place lies with food business operators.  The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement.</p><p>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates, among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law.  Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.  They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  In other words a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output.  This is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;one step forward one step backward&rdquo; traceability system.  There are additional traceability requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and its Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.</p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant.  The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating both in EU Member States and third countries.  In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States. </p><p>Import controls on products of animal origin, including fish and fishery products, arriving from third countries must be performed at an EU Border Inspection Post approved for that category of product being presented.  Consignments for import requiring veterinary checks must be notified in advance to the Border Inspection Post of import and presented on arrival for checks with all the appropriate documentation.  Third countries exporting to the EU must be approved to export fishery products to the EU and these countries are subject to audit by the Commission&rsquo;s FVO.</p><p>Border Inspection Posts in Ireland are operated by my Department.  The import controls procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance.  Reports of the findings of inspections are published on the FVO's website.</p><p>In order to import fish or fishery products into Ireland from a non-EU country the person who wishes to import fish/fishery products is required to register with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  The SFPA and the Border Inspection Posts operate an agreed sampling plan, which is reviewed annually, to ensure that they meet the EU criteria with respect to potential contaminants, and for the presence of any medical residues or where there is concern that the product may not be fit for human consumption. </p><p>Specific requirements for consumer information for fishery and aquaculture products such as more detailed information on provenance are also set down in EU Regulations under (EU 1379/2013) on the common organisation of markets.  The Regulations on fish labelling are enforced by the SFPA as part of ongoing official controls in food establishments under their supervision.  Comprehensive labelling checks including country of origin are carried out in establishments under SFPA official control as part of routine inspections by authorised SFPA officers and at retail level by the Environmental Officers.  </p></reply>

My aim is to build long-term trading relationships into the future in these sectors, particularly in new and emerging markets and since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. In relation to the individual sectors, the latest position is as is as follows:  </p><p><b>Meat</b><b>Markets</b></p><p>There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.  My Department engages on a very frequent basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues.  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to export beef to the US, Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran, to export sheepmeat to Singapore, South Africa, UAE, and Canada and to export pigmeat to Australia and Serbia. </p><p>In 2014, the Lebanon agreed to re-open its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats.  A certificate has also been agreed with Hong Kong allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat and agreement has been reached with Namibia on a certificate for the export of beef, sheepmeat and goatmeat.  Agreement was reached with the Philippines on the export of beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat and with Vietnam on the export of pork. Ireland can also export fresh pork in consumer ready cuts packaged for direct retails sale to New Zealand. </p><p>In relation to China, there has been a lifting of the ban on boneless beef from Ireland for animals under 30 months.  However, further work is required before trade will commence and my Department is at present engaging with the Chinese authorities on these technical aspects. </p><p>Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets.  This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.  Among Bord Bia's key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.</p><p><b>Dairy markets</b></p><p>The milk quota regime ended on March 31st.  The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence.  Planning for the post quota period by has been ongoing amongst all stakeholders for a number of years and I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence. </p><p>Most market analysts predict that medium-term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity. </p><p>Irish Dairy produce is exported to what is now approaching 130 countries and in 2014 exports were valued at over &euro;3bn.  Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential.  The removal of quotas will be a key driver in this respect.  Ireland exported dairy products worth &euro;2.3Bn in 2010 and by last year this had risen by over one-third to over &euro;3bn.  I remain acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish dairy products.  Key markets presenting future market possibilities for growth include China, the Middle East and Africa, and the re-opening of the Russian market is also an important objective. </p><p><b>Fish markets</b></p><p>There is a strong demand for fish globally and there will be export opportunities created by a requirement for an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood globally due to world population growth by 2030.  Seafood is increasingly being recognised as a natural valuable, cost effective source of protein for a growing global population.  In 2014 the value of seafood exports from Ireland was &euro;519 million. </p><p>As well as the seafood export opportunities in the 28 EU Member States, there are many existing seafood trade agreements with 3rd countries including US, Canada. Ireland also has Memoranda of Understanding with China, Japan and the Russian Federation.  A strong performance and attendance by Irish seafood companies at April 2015 Seafood Expo in Brussels highlighted Irish seafood as a world recognised quality-led brand.</p></reply>

We are seeking greater market access for dairy products both in terms of tariff reductions and removal of regulatory barriers.  Key exports would be branded packaged butter, powdered products and sports products.  We are also interested in meats &ndash; both beef and pork &ndash; and in opening the US market to Irish lamb.  The expectation in the past was of a limited opportunity or niche market for exports of beef to the US.  However, because of the recent higher prices in the US, the US market will become more attractive for other lower value beef cuts.  Consumer foods are also a potential area for growth, particularly porridge oats.</p><p>Of course, on beef, we have defensive interests as well although our defensive interests are tempered by recent developments in US prices and our gaining of access to the US market for Irish beef.  Nevertheless it is important that any quota granted to the US does not undermine the absorption capacity of the EU.  Furthermore, any quota agreed with the US would need to be matched with a <i>quid pro quo</i>quota for EU beef in the US.  Ireland would be well placed to benefit from such a quota, with our first mover advantage on the US market.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-14a.314.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051400046#WRJ02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 120 together.</p><p><b>BEEF</b></p><p>I am pleased to note that prices at the end of last week have increased 15% since last September and are now 8% higher than in the same point in 2014.  Current beef prices in Ireland stand at 106% of the EU15 average.  As of the end of last week, the average prices paid (excluding VAT) for an R3 steer stood at &euro;4.08/kg and an R3 Heifer at &euro;4.21.</p><p>Margins and input costs are also impacted by a number of factors other than price and these are the areas where I have focused my efforts since becoming Minister.  I established the Beef RoundTable forum last year in order to bring all stakeholders together and to facilitate open discussion between industry and farming organisations.  At the fourth meeting of the RoundTable in November, the stakeholders agreed to a broad range of outcomes which address areas of concern for the sector relating to product specification, price transparency and a weight limit moratorium until December 2015. </p><p>The RoundTable allows stakeholders to engage in a positive way on strategic goals for the sector.  As an example, the most recent meeting of the RoundTable held in February resulted in the establishment of a stakeholder group, led by Teagasc, which was tasked with preparing written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or those considering developing bull beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that I have provided a package worth over &euro;70 million for the beef sector in 2015.  This includes &euro;52 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) which forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme, and will involve a budget of some &euro;300m over a six year period.  The proposed BDGP is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology.  This will help farmers to manage their enterprises in a sustainable way that is cognisant of Ireland&rsquo;s climate change commitments, while supporting improved quality in the national suckler herd.  It will also place Ireland at the global forefront in the application of genomics technology and cement our reputation as one of the most important and export focussed beef producing nations in the world.</p><p>Of course, new market opportunities for both beef and live cattle exports also impact on the eventual returns to farmers.  The recent openings of the US market to Irish beef and the lifting of the beef ban in China are major achievements in this regard. </p><p><b>Sheepmeat</b></p><p>The industry-wide strategy for developing the sheep industry in Ireland was set out in the Food Harvest 2020 document which envisages a 20% increase in the value of output by 2020.  My approach to building on the significant achievements of the strategy up until now is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland's market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.</p><p>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2014, Irish sheep throughput at DAFM-approved plants was up slightly on 2013, with a marginal increase of 1%.  To date in 2015, throughput at DAFM approved plants is almost at the same level as this time last year, with an approximate increase of 9 % in the average national price for 2015 year to date over 2014.</p><p>At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector.  Under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the Knowledge Transfer measure which has a budget of &euro;100m.  The experience in the Sheep Technology and Adoption Programme (STAP) has informed the development of this measure.  In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and advisors in order to customise information exchange.  The Knowledge Transfer Programme for the sheep sector will be launched in 2016 when the current STAP concludes.  The proposed new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will also support, amongst others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes.  It includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for sheep farmers. </p><p><b>On the export front </b>I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities.  During 2014, we have agreed veterinary health certificates with Lebanon, Namibia, Hong Kong and The Philippines thus allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat to those countries.  Also, during my Trade Mission to China in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheep questionnaire which is a key step in gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat.  This represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat in the future.</p><p><b>PIGMEAT</b></p><p>Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery.  My Department carefully monitor developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.  Prices at the end of last week have increased to &euro;147.49, now 8.7% higher than when prices reached a three-year low of &euro;135.62 in January of this year.  I called on the European Commission earlier this year to monitor developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and/or private storage aid.  This resulted in the introduction of the Aids to Private Storage scheme for the pigmeat sector which opened in early March of this year.  However, due to the fact that EU pigmeat market prices stabilised somewhat over recent weeks and the uptake of the scheme by operators dropped to minimal volumes, the Commission closed the scheme as of this month. </p><p><b>In relation to the </b>Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully <b>aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market.  My Department</b>has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia. Ultimately however, the Russian ban on pigmeat is an EU wide issue and is likely only to be resolved at EU level.  <b>The Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. </b></p><p>Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways.  Firstly, I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors.  Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on-farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. </p><p>Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets. </p><p>For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market last year.  In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  My Department continues in its efforts to develop access to international markets.</p><p><b>POULTRY</b></p><p>Poultry meat has long been seen as a value for money food and this has underscored an increase in demand, particularly in recent years.  Margins and input costs are impacted by a number of factors other than price and while the price of compound feed and cereals eased somewhat during 2014, they still compose a significant cost for producers.  This together with energy costs and significant pressure from imports has presented difficulties for producers.  Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways.  Firstly, I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors.  Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on poultry farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on-farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the poultry sector. </p><p>While input prices reduced somewhat last year, producer and wholesale prices in the sector eased slightly throughout 2014.  Poultry is normally reared under contract to processors, for a pre-agreed price, and therefore poultry producers are not subject to the same price fluctuations as other farmers.  EU broiler prices decreased slightly during 2014 but there was a small recovery towards the end of the year.</p><p>The value of Irish poultrymeat exports in 2014 is estimated to have reversed the trend evident in recent years and grown by around 20%, helped by stronger processed poultry exports.  The value of exports increased to an estimated &euro;310 million, underpinned by strong growth in the export of processed products.  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish poultry processors and my Department continues in its efforts to develop access to developing international markets.</p><p><b>Fish</b></p><p>There is a strong demand for fish globally and there will be export opportunities created by a requirement for an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood globally due to world population growth by 2030.  Seafood is increasingly being recognised as a natural valuable, cost effective source of protein for a growing global population In 2014 the value of seafood exports from Ireland was &euro;519 million. </p><p>As well as the seafood export opportunities in the 28 EU Member States there are many existing seafood trade agreements with 3rd countries including US, Canada. Ireland also has Memoranda of Understanding with China, Japan and the Russian Federation.  A strong performance and attendance by Irish seafood companies at April 2015 Seafood Expo in Brussels highlighted Irish seafood as a world recognized quality-led brand.</p><p><b>DAIRY</b></p><p>Raw milk prices in Ireland currently average in the region of 31 cents per litre.  Using cross country comparable data from the EU Milk Market Observatory the most recently available data show that the price in Ireland is approximately one-fifth below the same month in 2014 which is consistent with EU average price movements in the same period.  These price developments have been evident throughout 2014 and into 2015 and are broadly attributable to global supply and demand factors which have also been exacerbated by the Russian ban on agri-food produce from the EU and elsewhere. </p><p>The suggestion, towards end 2014 and based on analysis by various domestic commentators was that prices in Ireland could fall to the mid-twenties per litre during 2015 but this has not materialised.  Co-operatives have also played a role in maintaining relative price stability.  In common with other sectors, a greater focus has developed in more recent years on margin than a simple examination of price.  In this respect ongoing efforts in the sector to drive efficiency at farm level will continue with a view to increasing margins. </p><p>The milk quota regime ended on March 31st.  The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence.  The consensus amongst market analysts is very clearly that medium-term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.  </p></reply>

Planning for the post-quota period has been ongoing amongst all stakeholders for a number of years and I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence.  With respect to the impending super levy, flexibility has been secured from the European Commission for farmers to pay the superlevy fine on a phased basis over 3 years.  My Department is working on the details of a scheme to give effect to this flexibility at national level.  This announcement will serve as a major boost to dairy farmers in helping to ease the cashflow burden of paying the superlevy bill.   </p>  <p>  Most market analysts predict that medium-term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.  Price volatility is a challenge, and it is critically important that processors, farmers and the banking system work together to mitigate   any negative impact. </p>  <p>  Irish Dairy exports in 201 4 were valued at over &euro;3bn and the dairy sector is by a number of measures the country&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry.  Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential.  The removal of quotas will be a key driver in this respect.  Ireland exported dairy products worth &euro;2.3Bn in 2010 and by last year this had risen by over one-third to over &euro;3bn.  I remain acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish dairy products. </p>  <p>  Developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy produce is a critically important element of the national strategy for the development of the sector, particularly in the context of the need to maximise market returns for significantly increased production in competitive markets worldwide.  It remains clearly evident from engagement with potential customers for Irish dairy products that the sustainability message has a strong resonance, and through the Origin Green Programme and the Dairy Quota Assurance Scheme we are building a brand image for Irish milk production based on our strong environmental credentials. </p>  <p>  In the run up to quota abolition a number of estimates in respect of capital investment have been made by various stakeholders.  Using data from Enterprise Ireland we can see that over the past 2 years some &euro;729M has been invested in 36 dairy and Infant Milk Formula plants.  This represents significant investment and whilst much of the information about specific plants is commercially sensitive, details regarding many of the larger investments are in the public domain.   </p>  <p>  There has been significant investment at farm level too.  A joint study by Teagasc and Bank of Ireland presented in early 2015 showed that Dairy farmers invested almost &euro;2 billion in the 2007 to 2013 period, with just under half of this investment in buildings, and almost &euro;70 million in milk quota over the period.  Teagasc estimates a requirement for further investment of &euro;1.4 billion at farm level to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  A &euro;4 billion Rural Development programme will help to bridge the infrastructural gap at farm level through targeted investments in equipment and facilities.   </p>  <p>  Issues pertaining to the ongoing development will be addressed, inter alia, in the 2025 report currently being drafted and the Deputy may also be aware that I recently announced the establishment of a forum to address the key issues arising in a post quota abolition environment and the expected expansion this will lead to in the dairy sector.  I envisage that this group will comprise relevant stakeholders, including farm organisations, processors and co-operatives, State and semi-State bodies, banks, environmental and others.  Such a forum is appropriate as a means of engagement on critical issues such as market developments, sustainability, animal health, milk quality and price volatility.   </p>  <p>  Taken together I believe the aforementioned reasons reflect the positive state of preparedness of the Irish dairy sector for the post quota era.</p></reply>

This flexibility allowed Member States to even out anomalies in payment levels while ensuring that the level of redistribution was not of a scale that could have a detrimental effect on the production capacity of their farmers.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, we used this flexibility to converge the extremely high and extremely low payment levels to a degree that would not jeopardise the achievement of the Food Harvest 2020 objectives.</p>  <p>  The reform also made special provision for generation renewal in the farming sector by providing additional supports for young farmers.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that both of these initiatives have served to make the reformed CAP fairer and more equitable, and to ensure that the benefits of the reform are evenly spread throughout the sector.</p></reply>

The sector&rsquo;s exports have performed strongly in the last five years, reaching an estimated &euro;10.45 billion in 2014 and consolidating the sizeable increases seen annually since 2010.  These have seen the value of Food &amp;amp; Beverage exports rise by 45% since 2009.  The Food Harvest 2020 plan set an ambitious target of 42% growth in such exports by 2020, compared to the baseline, and 27% growth had already been achieved by 2014 (the most recent data available).  Nonetheless, I regard it as prudent to continually review the internal and external environment so that we will continue to maximise the opportunities available to this indigenous sector, including in the export sphere.  To that end, I have appointed a 2025 Agri-Food Strategy Committee to report back to me by end June with any key recommendations and actions they consider necessary to ensure continued growth both home and abroad.</p></reply>

The regulations apply equally to thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred horses.  With regard to the identification of equines, Commission Regulation 504 of 2008, which sets down the implementing rules relating to the methods of identification of equines, has been transposed into national law via S.I. No. 207 of 2014.  The system for identifying horses for the first time on or after 1<sup>st</sup>July 2009 is comprised of three elements, namely</p><p>(i)  a single identification document (equine passport),</p><p>(ii)  a method to ensure an unequivocal link between the animal and the identification  document (transponder implanted by a practising veterinary surgeon), and</p><p>(iii)  a database recording under a unique identification number which details identification  information regarding the animal for which the identification document was issued, to a  person recorded in the database.</p><p>My Department also introduced legislation in 2014requiring transfer of ownership details to be notified to the relevant PIO and the central database within 30 days of date of transfer.</p><p>In addition, persons in charge of any premises in which horses or other equines (such as donkeys, ponies etc) are kept are required under S.I. No. 113 of 2014to register their premises with my Department and to maintain records to assist the Department in tracing horses, should a disease outbreak occur.</p><p>Furthermore, as part of the identification process for equines resident in Ireland, an owner/keeper who applies to have their horse identified is requested to provide the premises registration number of the holding where the animal will be normally resident to the issuing Passport Issuing Organisation (PIO).</p><p>Enforcement of relevant equine legislation is undertaken by authorised officers in my Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Local Authorities and other officers appointed by the Minister, as required.</p><p>Legislation on the identification and traceability of horses is primarily designed to ensure that horses can be traced throughout their life with a view to ensuring that they comply with legislation relating to animal and public health, including the exclusion of horses, which have been treated with certain medicines,from the human food chain, and animal welfare.  While it does not have specific objective in relation to animal husbandry, it can, as with any animal identification system, facilitate the adoption of best practice in relation to husbandry on farms.</p></reply>

Ireland has been to the forefront for many years in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards in order to eliminate waste, to protect young fish and to rebuild stocks in order to conserve fish stocks and ensure a sustainable future for the fishing industry.</p><p>Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish was a major component of the negotiations for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which were concluded under the Irish Presidency in 2013.  Following intensive negotiations, agreement was reached on a practical and phased discards policy or landing obligation commencing from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2015.  The agreed phasing in period, up to 1<sup>st</sup>January 2019, means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non-target species.</p><p>Under the regional decision-making process introduced by the new CFP, Ireland and the other Member States of the North Western Waters Region (Belgium, France, UK, Netherlands and Spain) agreed on a specific discards plan for pelagic stocks which came into effect this year.  This Group is continuing to develop a regional discards plan for demersal stocks which is due to be introduced on a phased basis from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2016.  The phasing in of the landing obligation will allow Ireland and the other members of the North Western Waters group to monitor its implementation. </p><p>At a national level, I have established a national Discards Implementation Group under the chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley, to facilitate the phasing in of the landing obligation.  The remit of this Group is to advise me on issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry. </p><p>I believe that the ending of the previous high levels of discarding carried out by all EU fleets fishing on stocks of interest to the Irish fishing industry will greatly help over time to underpin the sustainability of the Irish fishing industry and lead to greater conservation of fish stocks to the benefit of all.</p></reply>

However it has been decided to liaise with officials in the Ministry of Education and Science in Russia to ensure that Irish proposals in regard the provision of post placement reports are acceptable to the Russian Federation.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and that once adopted in Ireland the child is treated in the same way as other Irish children.  This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited.  The Department has advised the Russian Federation of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports.  It is imperative that this matter is fully addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial.</p></reply>

This new development which will provide a more comprehensive, integrated set of management processes, more efficient work practices, greater visibility and control of funds and commitments, will substantially improve the capacity of the Department and services on the ground to dynamically manage service by service and case by case approvals and changes in each of the programmes.  The new system will also reduce paperwork and duplication, simplify administration and enable the support programmes to be managed more efficiently and effectively.</p><p>The child registration element of the PIP system has now been fully launched and will provide for the efficient registration of children enrolling for the childcare programmes for the 2015/16 school year.  Following the introduction of the new system in the 2014/15 school year, some initial difficulties were experienced which resulted in some delays in confirming approval for childcare places.  However, every effort was made to ensure that service providers participating in the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme received sufficient &lsquo;preliminary funding&rsquo; to maintain their service while waiting on confirmation of payment levels.</p><p>The CCS programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare<b></b>at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents, whose children are enrolled in a participating childcare service during a designated week in October each year, can apply for subvention support under the programme.  Eligibility is confirmed  following verification of the details by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and/or Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>In previous years, CCS service providers received preliminary payments for the period September to January.  In January, funding approval levels were confirmed and balancing payments issued.  This year, due to technical difficulties experienced during the initial launch of the PIP system, service providers did not receive the approvals confirmation until the end of February 2015.  To ensure that service providers received sufficient funding to maintain their services while waiting on confirmation of funding levels and balancing payments, a further preliminary payment issued to provide for the period to the end of March 2015.  This payment was based on a percentage of each CCS service&rsquo;s approved funding for the 2013/14 year.</p><p>CCS service providers that reported an increase in the number of children eligible for subvention in their service, compared to the previous year's numbers, were given the opportunity to apply for additional provisional funding.  Those services that contacted my Department with specific difficulties were supported.  </p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a balancing payment was made to services in March 2015 which represents the funding levels approved following verification of application details.</p></reply>

The Centre&rsquo;s budget for 2015 is set at &euro;90,453. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Tusla that representatives met with members of the Voluntary Board of Management last December regarding the provision of funding to the Centre under the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The Centre has been without a full-time Co-Ordinator since March 2013.  This has impacted on the management and operation of the Centre in terms of services to children and families in the community and the continued development of the Centre in line with Tusla&rsquo;s priorities.</p>  <p>  Tusla fully recognises the need for community-based family support services serving the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare. Tusla will continue to work with the Centre and representatives from these communities to ensure that the funding currently available under the Family Resource Centre Programme is directed to a community-based service that is operating to its full potential and best supports and promotes the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families, in line with Tusla&rsquo;s priorities.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a decision has been made to establish a new Family Resource Centre based in Kenmare to serve the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare.  A new legal entity will be formed. The current Voluntary Board of Management  of Kenmare Community Care will be re-constituted.  It will initially include community representatives from the Family Resource Centre referred to and Kenmare Community Care. </p>  <p>  In time, it is proposed that the new Voluntary Board of Management will also include community representatives from Tahilla, Castlecove and Kilgarvan.  The detail of this will be a matter for discussion and agreement under an agreed process which is being managed and facilitated by Tusla.  The first meeting in this agreed process is to take place later this month.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that the existing Family Resource Centre will continue to administer its Programme funding until the process is completed and will continue to receive Tusla funding for counselling services during the process.</p></reply>

The organisation is funded by Tusla up to the end of June 2015.  I am assured by Tusla that existing Family Resource Centres have the capacity to deliver the services in question to an appropriate level.</p>  <p>  In seeking to improve outcomes and wellbeing for children and young people, Tusla must ensure that it makes the most efficient use of its resources in a way that is efficient, equitable, proportionate and sustainable.  Tusla is giving priority in 2015 to the protection of front-line services and those which are best aligned to the priority outcomes as set out in the Agency's Corporate Plan.  Tusla values the work of the agency in question and recognises the impact of its work across the Family Resource Centre Programme. However, having regard to Tusla's priorities and the overall level of resource available, it is necessary to focus on those services operating more directly at the front line. </p>  <p>  Tusla is in receipt of Exchequer funding of &euro;643m in 2015 which represents an increase of &euro;34m or 5.3% over 2014.

Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 386 of 2006) the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is required to maintain the Asbestosis and Mesothelioma Register. Operation of the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  From a health service perspective, asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos and patients with this condition have access to the same range of diagnostic and treatment services provided in the public health system as other patients with chronic lung conditions.</p>  <p>  Patients with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious conditions, such as lung cancer, mesothelioma and pleural disease. Very severe cases of asbestosis can cause serious ill health and reduce life expectancy. However, in many cases, the condition does not progress. More people with asbestosis die as a result of one or more of the cancers mentioned above rather than from asbestosis itself.</p>  <p>  Treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis. Treatment components include quitting smoking, vaccinations against potentially dangerous lung infections such as influenza and pneumococcus, drug therapies and oxygen therapy.</p></reply>

There is no entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition. The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014. Key findings of the Expert Panel were that it would not be feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility and that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  Following publication of the two reports, in November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p><p>The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner. The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by 60 % from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 83,000 at the end of March this year.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that, under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals not holding a medical card, a GP visit card or not covered under the LTI scheme who incur ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p></reply>

Currently two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one in four children are overweight or obese.  One in five adults are physically inactive and only 25 per cent of children meet the guidelines on physical activity.  The report in question arises from a recent presentation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at the European Congress on Obesity in Prague.  At this meeting the WHO presented the results of their obesity forecasting modelling project.</p>  <p>  This looked at data from 53 European countries comparing recorded data from 2010 and projected figures for 2030. It is reported that the proportion of overweight and obesity will increase in Irish men from 74 and 26 percent to 89 and 48 percent. For women the increase in obesity will be from 23 to 57 per cent. The WHO states that by 2030 Europe will face an obesity crisis of &ldquo;enormous proportions&rdquo;.  The WHO caution that the data needs to be interpreted with extreme caution as it is a forecasting exercise.  The authors of the report call for Governments to do more to restrict unhealthy food marketing, inform consumers about what&rsquo;s in food and make healthy food more affordable.</p>  <p>  In response to the obesity epidemic, my Department established a Special Action Group on Obesity in 2011 and is working on a range of measures including: The development of revised Healthy Eating Guidelines: Media campaigns to promote awareness on healthy eating: Treatment Guidelines for overweight and obesity: Calorie Posting in restaurants: Developing a code of practice for marketing in the non- broadcast media.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland proposed the development of an EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity and is now leading part of this work.  A National Physical Activity Plan will soon be launched by Healthy Ireland and the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills have also been working to ensure a more co-ordinated approach and infrastructure to support schools and teachers to address health and wellbeing issues arising in schools. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the obesity challenge, I have prioritised the development of an Obesity Policy and Action Plan under the Healthy Ireland Framework as a 2015 major project.  The plan will run from 2015 to 2025.  A national consultation day was held last week with approximately 150 key stakeholders.  Further consultation days are planned for children and healthcare professionals.  This action plan will be finalised this year and brought to government for approval.  Significant progress has already been made in implementing Healthy Ireland.

Approximately 70% of claims are against HSE run maternity hospital units and 30% are against Dublin voluntary maternity hospital units. Claims against HSE run maternity units as a percentage of overall national births amount to 0.20% for 2014.  Claims against voluntary maternity hospital units amount to 0.13% for 2014.</p><p>These figures provide a more significant contextualisation of the figures which appeared in the Sunday newspaper.</p><p>My Department is developing a National Maternity Strategy which will provide strategic direction for the optimal development of maternity services to ensure that women have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs.  A Maternity Strategy Steering Group has been established to advise on the development of the Strategy.  The  Head of Clinical Risk in the State Claims Agency is a member of the Group. </p><p>I also intend to establish a National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme to address and improve maternity services around the country and to  implement the policy being developed by the Maternity Strategy Steering Group.  The Programme will provide the cross-sectoral framework and the necessary governance, integration and leadership to drive reform and standardise care across all 19 maternity units. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th><div>as a % of Total  <br /><br />(excl Symphysiotomy)</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>2012<br /><br />%</div></td><td><div>2013<br /><br />%</div></td><td><div>2014<br /><br />%</div></td></tr><tr><td>HSE run</td><td><div>69.4</div></td><td><div>67</div></td><td><div>70.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>VMaternity Services Claims Created oluntary run</td><td><div>30.6</div></td><td><div>33</div></td><td><div>29.6</div></td></tr></table><table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>-</th><th><div>Maternity Services Claims Created <br /><br />(excl Symphysiotomy) <br /><br />as % of Births</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>2012<br /><br />%</div></td><td><div>2013<br /><br />%</div></td><td><div>2014<br /><br />%</div></td></tr><tr><td>HSE run</td><td><div>0.19</div></td><td><div>0.15</div></td><td><div>0.20</div></td></tr><tr><td>Voluntary run</td><td><div>0.14</div></td><td><div>0.12</div></td><td><div>0.13</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

We plan to meet in Dublin in the near future to discuss these matters in more detail. </p>  <p>  Last December the signing of the Stormont House Agreement demonstrated what can be achieved when the two Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive parties work together towards the shared aims of advancing the reconciliation agenda and building a more prosperous Northern Ireland.

The purpose of my visit was to strengthen our relations with Switzerland, particularly by advancing our cooperation on issues of international concern and by supporting our important bilateral economic relations.  I believe my visit achieved both of these goals and I am very grateful to my Swiss hosts for their excellent cooperation.</p>  <p>  I travelled to Berne on 6 May and met with Minister Burkhalter for consultations on a range of foreign policy issues of mutual interest. Our discussions focused on areas where our countries have worked closely together, such as nuclear disarmament, the OSCE and sustainable development. Switzerland and Ireland share common approaches on many policies including UN reform, the role of the OSCE, and non-proliferation and it was agreed that further opportunities for such cooperation should be pursued. </p>  <p>  I then travelled to Zurich where I addressed a seminar organised by the Irish Funds Industry Association in cooperation with IDA Ireland.  The seminar on 7 May was attended by fund and asset managers in Switzerland and in my opening address I highlighted the Government&rsquo;s commitment to IFS2020 &ndash; the new Strategy for Ireland's International Financial Services Sector.  The full text of my speech was attached to a press release issued on that date by my Department and which is available on the Departmental website.</p>  <p>  The seminar, hosted by Swiss global financial services company UBS, was also addressed by industry experts who outlined why Ireland is among the best countries in the world to do business and is the location of choice for administrating and domiciling investment funds.</p>  <p>  Switzerland is Ireland&rsquo;s fifth largest market for merchandise exports and, during my visit, I had the opportunity to meet with current and potential Swiss investors, including senior management at Zurich Insurance and at UBS.</p></reply>

Since last week&rsquo;s general election in the UK, Prime Minister Cameron has reiterated his commitment to holding a referendum on the country&rsquo;s EU membership by 2017. While a referendum on the subject will be strictly a matter for the British people to decide, my Government colleagues and I have been clear in stating that the more than forty years of EU membership by the UK and Ireland have been hugely beneficial to our country and our bilateral relationship. The important role the EU has played in the context of Northern Ireland should also not be forgotten, as the Taoiseach emphasised recently in a speech in Belfast.</p><p>  Our unique relationship with the UK &ndash; in economic, social, cultural and historical terms &ndash; means we have a deep interest in the outcome of this debate about that country&rsquo;s future in Europe. We also value the contribution the UK has made to the EU and we share a similar approach on many key policy areas. A key priority will be ensuring that our UK partners are fully aware of the potential consequences for Ireland of any fundamental change in the nature of their membership of the EU. </p><p>  I have addressed many of these points directly with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.  He and I now speak on a regular basis and will continue to do so following his re-appointment to the role this week. I also discuss this issue with other EU counterparts as well as those from outside the EU.  In addition to my own contacts and those of the Taoiseach and others, the Embassy of Ireland in London is, of course, very active with regard to the EU-UK relationship.  Its input and reporting on this issue, together with the reports and analysis we receive from our other diplomatic missions across the EU, will continue to be of key importance.</p><p>  We will work closely in the coming period with both our British and EU partners with the objective of ensuring continued UK membership of the European Union. </p></reply>

The record of the D&aacute;il therefore is accurate and does not require correction. </p><p>  The Home Tuition Scheme operated by my Department is designed to support children who are not in a position to attend school and, because of this, it is generally the case that the tuition is provided at the child's place of residence. In the majority of cases therefore, there will be 1 child in receipt of an individualised educational programme at home. The tuition will therefore be delivered on a 1:1 basis in all such cases. Funding is provided by my Department on this basis. Where parents of children who are eligible for home tuition have sought alternative arrangements to be put in place for the tuition my Department has responded and facilitated by putting arrangements in place with private commercial organisations which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting. Payment in these cases is made directly to the service provider and is calculated on a group rate basis.  My Department has no contract with these providers and therefore the question of procurement or tendering does not arise.  </p><p>  At the time when a previous question on the issue was addressed my Department had concluded an arrangement with one private commercial organisation which provided group tuition to children in a class type setting.  Under that arrangement, payment was made directly to the service provider concerned and was calculated on a group rate basis. The arrangement which at that time was the only exception, was put in place to facilitate the parents of the children in question all of whom had been approved as eligible for home tuition.</p><p>  There are now similar arrangements in place with 6 private pre-school providers which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting for children for whom home tuition has been approved.  The Deputy may be aware that the NCSE is at an advanced stage in preparing policy advice on the education of children with autism which will incorporate a review of current state- funded educational provision for children with autism. I expect that the final report, which is to be delivered shortly, will consider the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

The scale and nature of the developmental response required to address such gaps will also be identified. </p><p>  The study is expected to include recommendations on measures to build up the domestic skill supply of talent over the period 2014-2020, including through (a) the higher education and further education systems; continuing professional development; and  talent retention initiatives. It will also advise on optimising the use of existing resources &ndash; in both Government and the private sector.</p><p>  The Further Education and Training (FET) Services Plan (2015) estimates that there will be 3,101 beneficiaries of FET provision in the Food and Beverages sectors in 2015.  The plan also estimates that there will be 9,195 beneficiaries of FET provision in the Tourism and Sport sectors in 2015.  Overall in 2015 there is an estimated increase of 4,768 beneficiaries of FET provision in these sectors.</p><p>  SOLAS is also currently engaged in the development of a pilot Career Traineeship model of training programme delivery for the hotel sector.  This model is being developed in partnership with Education and Training Boards (ETBs) the Irish Hotel Federation, Failte Ireland and hoteliers.These pilot training programmes will commence in the last quarter of 2015.  In addition, Momentum 2 provides for 1,334 places for the Hospitality Sector.</p></reply>

Full details of the scheme are available for downloading from their website: <i>www.examinations.ie/candidates/reasonableaccommodations.</i>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.</p></reply>

They include a range of policy options and measures that could potentially address the challenges facing Gaeltacht schools.  Interested parties have been invited to provide their views in relation to the policy options set out in the document.  This will be done through a survey and responses are requested by 15 June 2015.  It is hoped that organisations and individuals in the Gaeltacht and with an interest in Gaeltacht education will respond to the survey.  It is also intended to meet with stakeholder groups during the consultation process.  It is expected that there will be a forum in the autumn where the findings of the consultation will be considered.</p>  <p>  Such responses will inform the development of a Gaeltacht Education Policy.

However, the allocation process for the 2015/16 school year has not concluded and additional applications may also be received under any second round application process.</p>  <p>  All children with Down syndrome had previously been entitled to receive additional teaching support either through the General Allocation Model or if they had an additional low incidence disability, as set out in my Departments Circular 02/05.  However, as Down syndrome had not previously been designated as a distinct category for resource allocation purposes, it is not possible to categorically state how many children with Down syndrome currently attend main stream education.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced that additional resources will be allocated to schools, as an interim measure, to support those children with Down syndrome, who are not already supported through the (NCSE) low incidence resource teaching annual allocation process.</p>  <p>  I advised that this measure was being introduced in recognition of the length of time it will take to introduce the new resource teacher allocation model and the fact that children with Down syndrome experience a cluster of difficulties relating to this syndrome, in addition to general learning difficulties, including speech and language developmental delays.</p>  <p>  In the context of the recent announcement that the proposed new model for allocating resource teachers to schools will not now be introduced from September 2015, I have reviewed the position in relation to what steps might be taken to improve educational provision for children with Down syndrome in mainstream schools.</p>  <p>  On 24th of March, I announced that the Government has agreed that additional resources will be allocated to schools, as an interim measure, to support those children with Down syndrome, who are not already supported through the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) annual allocation process.</p>  <p>  This measure is being introduced now in recognition of the length of time it will take to introduce the new resource teacher model which was recommended by the NCSE.</p>  <p>  Under the interim measure schools will receive 2.5 resource teacher hours per week for each qualifying child.</p>  <p>  This new allocation means there will now be certainty regarding the provision which will be made for children with Down syndrome with a Mild General Learning Difficulty.</p>  <p>  As my Department is continuing to develop the new allocation model for schools and is currently working to devise a pilot of the new model, I do not propose to amend the current list of low incidence disabilities pending the introduction of a new allocation model.</p>  <p>  I can confirm, however, that interim allocations for children with Down syndrome, as set out above, will remain in place until such time as the proposed new model for allocating teaching supports to children with special education needs comes into force.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>  <p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will consider all applications for SNA support which have been made by schools. Schools will be advised of their revised SNA allocations for the 2015/16 school year, prior to the end of the current school year.</p>  <p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

As Chair of that Group, I am working to ensure that the work that is being progressed across Government Departments has a rural focus and reflects the challenges and issues facing rural Ireland.</p><p>The IDG, which is made up of representative s from all relevant Government Departments , is currently working in a coordinated way to ensure thateach Department&rsquo;s policy development and implementation fully considers the needs of rural communities. In this context, it is about maximising the financial resources already available for rural development and ensuring that these resources are directed in a way that best supports the sustainable economic development of rural areas.</p><p>In addition to this, both Minister Kelly and I have indicated recently that we intend to advance the implementation of recommendation 1 of the CEDRA Report, which calls for the development of a <i>Rural Policy Statement</i>. Work on this will begin shortly and I am confident that this will provide a framework to ensure that due consideration is given to the challenges and issues facing rural communities and will support the alignment of policy design and implementation frameworks.</p><p>In order to maintain strong links with people in rural Ireland who are involved in or have a strong interest in the economic development of rural areas and communities, the Minister and I have recently established an Expert Advisory Group to monitor progress and provide advice in respect of the implementation of the recommendations in the CEDRA report.  This group, which is chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane and met for the first time recently, is looking at the CEDRA recommendations with a view to offering advice regarding priority actions to support the implementation process.</p><p>&euro;1 million was allocated in the Budget for 2015 to establish a Rural Innovation and Development fund in line with CEDRA recommendations to support innovative, small scale pilot initiatives.  Agreement has been reached on the types of projects to be supported under this scheme and a call for proposals for some elements will issue shortly.</p><p>Work is also advancing on the establishment of a Rural Economic Development Zone (REDZ) pilot scheme and an amount of &euro;2million is being made available to support the implementation of this pilot. I expect to announce the details of this pilot shortly.

In the case of a One Adult Household (capped at &euro;160), &euro;30 will be added to any bill where outstanding payments equate to the total annual payment and remain unpaid for 3 months or more. An additional &euro;30 will be added on every anniversary of the original add on date while the bill remains unpaid or a payment plan has not been entered into with Irish Water. In the case of a Two Adult Household (capped at &euro;260), &euro;60 will be added and again at each anniversary.</p>  <p>  The late payment charges will only apply where someone is in arrears for more than 12 months and has not entered into a payment plan with Irish Water. Payment plans will be developed based on an ability to pay and it is important to note that the late payment charges are focused on those who &ldquo;will not pay&rdquo;, rather than those who cannot pay.</p>  <p>  A range of flexible payment options will be available. Irish Water will facilitate bill payment through direct debit, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a Paypoint or Payzone sign, or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. The overall net cost for those who register is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others. Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.</p>  <p>  Any customers who have unpaid water charges can be pursued through the Courts by Irish Water for the sums due and a debt judgment may be obtained against the customer.  As announced recently, the Government intends to bring forward legislation to implement a number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the enforcement of debt. Accordingly, my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality will be bringing forward a Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill which will allow creditors to apply to the Court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deduction form social welfare payments, as appropriate for the purposes of enforcing debt.</p>  <p>  I will be bringing forward measures to strengthen the regulatory regime around the payment of charges through measures not involving court proceedings.

Each sub-regional area was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each county received a viable allocation in line with European Commission guidelines.  Cork was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county.  The fact that the population in Cork, outside the city, is almost twice that of any other county and more than three times some counties, was also taken into consideration.  Nationally, these minimum allocations total &euro;81 million.  A measure of population density (county population divided by km<sup>2</sup>) was used to distribute one half of the remaining fund (&euro;69.5m).  An &lsquo;average amount&rsquo; based on 26 counties was calculated.  Each county&rsquo;s population density was then compared to the average population density for the country.  For those counties where the density was above or below average the average amount was adjusted upwards (below average) or downwards (above average) based on the percentage deviation from the average to determine an allocation to each county. </p><p>The second half of the remaining fund (&euro;69.5 million) was allocated to each county using a Resource Allocation Model (RAM).  The model was developed by Trutz Haase using information from the 2011 census and the Trutz Haase deprivation index as a measure of deprivation.  The underlying variables of the model include consideration of demographic decline, social class deprivation and labour market deprivation.  The model also used CSO area classification to measure the urban-rural spectrum.  These calculations were weighted towards rural areas and considered areas with low and medium deprivation. </p><p>The final allocations for each county determined using the methodology outlined above are set out in Table 1 below. </p><p><b>Table 1: LEADER Allocations 2014-2020</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Programme Allocation</th></tr><tr><td>Rural Dublin</td><td>&euro;6,370,438.43</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;5,261,600.01</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>&euro;6,903,123.57</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;6,336,549.00</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;6,416,803.43</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>&euro;7,791,572.91</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>&euro;9,840,140.56</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;10,103,443.28</td></tr><tr><td>County Waterford</td><td>&euro;7,522,796.18</td></tr><tr><td>County Cork</td><td>&euro;13,938,823.22</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>&euro;10,219,868.29</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;8,920,224.65</td></tr><tr><td>County Limerick</td><td>&euro;9,276,593.96</td></tr><tr><td>County Galway  </td><td>&euro;12,195,883.61</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>&euro;11,121,431.88</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro;8,852,659.22</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;6,101,862.01</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>&euro;5,998,474.74</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;7,655,647.81</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;8,522,285.84</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;12,913,877.86</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>&euro;7,592,719.51</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>&euro;7,124,586.86</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;7,597,623.07</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro;8,036,763.90</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>&euro;7,384,206.22</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;220,000,000.00</td></tr></table></p><p>Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the RDP.  While the allocation for the LEADER element of the 2014-2020 Programme is less than the value of the LEADER element of 2007-2013 programme, I am confident that within the confines of the fiscal environment we have experienced in the recent past, the Government has allocated the maximum amount possible to support the LEADER elements of the 2014-2020 programme.  This funding, coupled with the Government&rsquo;s drive to increase coordination at a local level and the commitment to the delivery of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA), will ensure that the impact of the available funding will be maximised to support the sustainable development of our rural communities. </p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.</p><p><b></b>According to the PRTB Annual Report for 2013, adjudication processing times were an average of 7 months in 2013 compared to 12 months in 2012.  For 2014, I understand adjudications were taking an average of 5 to 6 months to process.

In the case of debtors, including in relation to water charges, it will be open to the creditor to apply to the Court for an Order under the proposed Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill allowing either an attachment of earnings or a deduction from social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purpose of discharging the debt.</p><p>The payment of water charges will be further facilitated through regulatory measures which do not require court proceedings. These have been approved by Government and will be brought before the Oireachtas in due course.  Pending establishment of the PRTB deposit protection scheme, these will include a requirement for landlords to retain a tenant deposit until the tenant provides evidence that water charges due have been paid.  Following establishment of the deposit protection scheme, tenants will have to demonstrate that water charges due have been paid before the deposit can be returned.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas.  The Bill has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with second stage in the Seanad.  It will return to the Seanad for Committee Stage in the coming weeks; foremost among the amendments will be provisions for the establishment of a custodial deposit protection scheme to be operated by the PRTB.  My Department will work closely with the PRTB in planning and preparing for the scheme, including in relation to the resources necessary for its effective implementation.</p></reply>

In progressing the Government&rsquo;s national low-carbon transition agenda, the National Policy Position and the Bill are parallel and complementary pillars.</p><p>As set out in the National Policy Position, the National Climate Change Transition Agenda is being guided by a long-term vision of low-carbon transition based on:</p><p>- an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and</p><p>- in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p><p>Furthermore, Ireland is already subject to legally binding greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to the year 2020 as a result of the EU&rsquo;s Effort Sharing Decision of 2009 and negotiations are currently underway to agree further mitigation targets for each Member State up to the year 2030, and this incremental process of target setting will likely continue up to the year 2050.  Accordingly, putting in place our own mitigation targets in domestic legislation would cut across and interfere with this target-setting process at EU level.</p><p>The National Expert Advisory Council on Climate Change to be formally established under the Bill, will be independent in the performance of its functions.  While it will have a number of <i>ex officio</i>members, namely, the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, they will be a minority of the overall membership. In addition, these <i>ex officio</i>members should not be seen as an impediment to independence but, rather, as bringing a much-needed understanding of the practicalities of policy implementation in the main greenhouse gas emitting sectors. They will also offer a wealth of practical expertise and experience gained by those front-line organisations having a strong low-carbon focus. The Council is being established so as to appreciate both the demands of our mitigation targets and the realities of where we are now and it will play a significant role in providing independent and robust advice as we navigate a course towards our mitigation targets, which are ambitious yet achievable.</p></reply>

The availability of such services will enable citizens and businesses to access a wide range of new services, including the capacity to work from home and the ability to innovate with existing and new businesses. Experience from the Department's Trading Online programme shows that using the internet to sell goods and services has a positive impact on businesses.

Therefore, the draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in 2016 to incentivise larger heat users in the industrial and commercial sector to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the RHI, including those relating to support tariffs and eligible technologies, will be established during the process of designing the scheme. In this regard the first stage of the public consultation process will commence shortly to examine options in relation to the technologies to be supported including establishing the date from which a renewable heating installation could be eligible for support under the scheme. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.</p></reply>

A new Energy Policy Paper, which will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy up to 2030, is being developed. To facilitate the development of the new Policy Paper, a Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland was published in May 2014 opening a written public consultation process that concluded on 31 July. The Green Paper sets out six policy priority areas in respect of which submissions were sought. These are: Empowering Energy Citizens; and Prices; ; ; ; and .</p><p>Over 1,200 submissions were received in the written consultation process. In addition, there was a targeted stakeholder consultation process involving 11 seminars, six of which focused on the priorities identified in the Green Paper, four regional seminars and a seminar on costs. My Department is carrying out the detailed work needed to develop the new Policy Paper. I aim to publish the Policy Paper in September 2015.</p></reply>

The EirGrid reports are required to be comprehensive, route-specific studies of overhead and underground options for the projects. They must also be complete, comparable (overhead line comparable against underground cable) and objective and include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. After consideration of the reports, the Panel is required to provide an opinion to me on the projects. Thereafter, EirGrid will publicly consult on each project. The Panel contains appropriate experts to consider cost, technical and environmental matters. I understand that the Panel has not, to date, involved external experts in its considerations.</p><p>Having now completed its analysis of EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid West report, the Panel provided its opinion to me on 29 April 2015. The Panel is unanimously of the opinion that the EirGrid report is complete and objective. The Panel is fully satisfied that EirGrid carried out and completed the report in full accordance with the Terms of Reference for the report set by the Panel. I understand that EirGrid will soon publish the report for public consultation and will be seeking public feedback on each of the options presented.</p><p>On 27 March 2015, Eirgrid published, for public comment, a discussion paper on Ireland's grid development strategy entitled &quot;Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow&quot;. The paper confirms that Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy transmission needs may be met with less new infrastructure than previously anticipated because of technological developments and updated projections of future electricity demand.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The discussion puts forward options for Grid West and Grid Link and reaffirms the need for the North South Transmission Line project as currently proposed, i.e. a 400kV overhead line being the most appropriate solution. In relation to the Grid Link project,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>the discussion paper, which was subject to an independent peer review, confirms the need to reinforce the transmission system in the South East. It suggests an additional option to the original Grid Link options. The original options would require either (i) the construction of significant amounts of new overhead lines or (ii) the laying of significant amounts of underground cable. The additional option contained in the recently published discussion document would involve an underwater cable in the Shannon estuary and upgrading existing transmission lines rather than building new lines.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>EirGrid will engage with stakeholders to discuss the possible options as it continues its evaluation of the three potential solutions outlined in the draft strategy, with a view to making a submission to the Independent Expert Panel in Autumn 2015. I expect to receive the Panel's opinion on the Grid Link project in quarter three, 2015. Thereafter, I understand that EirGrid intends to hold public consultation on Grid Link towards the latter part of this year.</p><p>It is also important to note that all of the major EirGrid projects will be the subject of planning applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></reply>

The paper, which reviews, inter alia, the Grid Link, Grid West, and North South Transmission Line projects, confirms that Ireland&rsquo;s energy transmission needs may be met with reduced new infrastructure because of technological developments as well as updated projections of future electricity demand.</p>  <p>  The discussion paper, which was subject to an independent peer review, confirms the need to reinforce the transmission system in the South East.

The discussion paper also puts forward options for Grid West and reaffirms the need for the North South Transmission Line project, affirming that the existing proposal for a 400kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution for the project.</p>  <p>  At the time of publication, EirGrid highlighted that it was seeking feedback from the public within 8 weeks. EirGrid is currently holding a series of regional forums on the draft strategy. In response to requests for additional time for stakeholders to consider and respond to the discussion paper, EirGrid has decided to extend the deadline for submission of feedback from the public to 5 June 2015.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that EirGrid will be holding separate consultations on a number of its projects, including the Grid Link project, later this year. Stakeholders and members of the public will have opportunities to input their views to EirGrid during those consultations.</p></reply>

In this regard, a balance must be struck between direct enterprise support, entry level training and advanced/professional training.  SOLAS, employers, further and higher education providers - particularly the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) - and F&aacute;ilte Ireland all have complementary roles to play in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Government's new Tourism Policy Statement recognises that the sector is an essential component of Ireland's employment base and that its jobs are geographically dispersed and outlining policy objectives to strengthen the capacity of people working in the sector.  I will soon be announcing a new Tourism Leadership Group, which will prepare a detailed Tourism Action Plan to implement these policy proposals.  All matters relevant to ensuring that the industry has the requisite skills to ensure we achieve our ambitious growth targets will be considered as part of this work.</p></reply>

I have set aside funding of &euro;2m this year to support a signage programme/engineering measures in line with the actions proposed in Circular RSD 01/2014 of 15 October 2014.  The intention is to allocate this funding as local authorities come forward with their proposals in respect of implementing 30km/h speed limits in housing areas. Since then the new Speed Limit Guidelines have been issued which provide further guidance for road authorities in respect of 30 km/h speed limit zones and the provision of speed limit signs or new warning signs for such areas as appropriate.  Local authorities have been requested to reply to my Department by this Friday (15 May) with an estimate (as accurately as possible) of their signage requirements to the end of November 2015. The Department has advised that account needs to be taken of the timescale required for Councils to apply bye-laws and to individually procure signs and posts. It is intended that these figures (to end November 2015) will be used as a basis for calculating additional grant allocations for local authorities in the current year. There will be an opportunity to modify the "post-November 2015" requirements later in the year as this initiative will continue into next year. Part of the overall process is an assessment by local authorities of compliance levels in terms of the new speed limits and whether further engineering measures will be required to assist in slowing traffic.</p></reply>

The NTA made its decision after a public consultation.  </p>  <p>  The NTA believes that some competition in awarding operating contracts will be good for the bus market and for the travelling public in encouraging transport operators to provide enhanced services.  Following the consultation phase, the NTA decided that 10% was sufficient to achieve this without fundamentally damaging the market as it stands or the existing network.  Routes were chosen on this basis and Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann can compete for the routes in this tender process.</p>  <p>  The tendering will also allow the NTA to consider whether they are getting the right value for the taxpayer and the travelling public in awarding the other routes to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann as more money continues to be invested in public transport.  </p>  <p>  The detailed issues raised on the tendering process itself are matters for the National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have referred the Deputies' questions to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

However, I understand that such assistance is provided by other Government Departments, principally the Department of Social Protection. From my Department's perspective, accessibility improvements to public transport services are being advanced in the context of <i>Transport Access for All</i>(my Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005) and in the context of the Government's </p><p><i>Transport Access for All</i>sets out a series of policy objectives and targets for accessible public transport across all modes. The Plan is premised on the principle that through accessibility improvements to the public transport system for people with disabilities, access for all people will be improved. This is being done as extensively as possible having regard to the availability of resources.</p><p>Targets in <i>Transport Access for All</i>are reflected in the <i>National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan.</i>Both Plans contain monitoring and evaluation mechanisms which involve representatives of people with disabilities including representatives of people with visual impairments.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>There are also a number of ways in which my Department is made aware of possible risk to protected structures, sites or monuments, one of these being the receipt of applications for funding for their repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding.</p><p>In that regard, funding for the protection of heritage sites and buildings continues to be provided by my Department, from within available resources, through schemes that are either directly administered, or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.

This issue has become more acute in recent years, as evidenced by the recent spate of fires in various parts of the country, including those in Co. Kerry. Even planned and/or "controlled" burning can get out of hand very quickly, so it is critically important that every member of society realises the damage that can be caused to property and, indeed, the health and welfare of family, neighbours and the wider community, and the responding emergency services.  Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012 prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife.  Burning of vegetation on uncultivated land is prohibited during these dates. My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Agriculture and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the cause(s) of recent wild fires which have affected Killarney National Park and, where evidence is forthcoming, to pursue appropriate enforcement under the Wildlife Act or other legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department is one of a number of agencies represented on the Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Group that explores issues surrounding wild fires.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on the Group and has responsibility in leading any potential criminal investigations into wild fires. My Department cooperates fully with any Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies.</p>  <p>  My Department is exploring how best to utilise natural features within the landscape of Killarney National Park&ndash; such as streams, rivers, tracks and trails &ndash; to act as &ldquo;natural fire breaks&rdquo; in helping to minimise the risk of wild fires within the Park.  Targeted and minimal on-site work &ndash; including the cutting back of combustible material, (furze, heathers, over-grown grassland areas) &ndash; to create these &ldquo;natural fire breaks&rdquo; should help to control the spread of wild fires, without impacting significantly on habitats (including &ldquo;qualifying interests&rdquo; in the Special Area of Conservation).  A balance will have to be achieved between works necessary/desirable to assist in the control of wild fires within designated areas (such as SACs, SPAs and NHAs.) on the one hand, and the sustainable conservation and protection of the qualifying interests within such designated sites.</p>  <p>  I would appeal to all members of the public to be more responsible about actions they take and to be mindful of the potential damage to life, private property and public property that can be caused by carelessly setting fires.</p></reply>

Cork, was designated as part of the Beara Peninsula Special Protection Area (SPA), under the EU Birds Directive. The Chough was one of the species for which the site was chosen. Sherkin Island was not designated as an SPA.</p>  <p>  The Chough SPA network includes breeding cliffs and adjacent cliff top feeding areas; roosts; and other key feeding areas, such as sand dunes and other areas regularly used by high numbers of Chough. The identification of the most suitable sites and their boundaries for SPA designation purposes was largely based on the last national breeding Chough survey in 2002-03 and a 3-year research project. The Chough SPA network accounted then for approximately 63% of the national population and was considered fully adequate to meet Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Birds Directive.</p>  <p>  The number of choughs recorded on Sherkin during the survey was very low and, for that reason, designation was not considered necessary.</p></reply>
