    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-12a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111200054#WRA00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place. During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows those who held a valid  declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt before the commencement of the Act to continue with an adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must have completed the process by the 31st October 2013. </p><p>  By their nature transitional provisions must be time limited, and it was considered by the Government at the time, and the Oireachtas, that three years was a reasonable period of time to finalise an adoption which was in process when the Adoption Act 2010 came into force. The Hague Convention sets out important safeguards to be implemented by member countries so as to ensure that the rights of children and families are protected and there is prevention of illegal, irregular, premature or ill prepared inter country adoptions.  Ireland has ratified the Hague Convention and under the Adoption Act 2010 the Convention has force of law in Ireland. The provisions of the Adoption Act 2010 sought to balance the desire for a reasonable period of transition with the overall commitment  to the mutual support amongst member countries for the operation of the standards and safeguards in inter country adoption outlined in the Convention. </p><p>   One particular concern that has coincided with the expiry of the transitional provisions provided for in Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, is the position of a  small number of applicants who were at a late stage in adopting from Russia when  changes to Russian legislation were enacted which meant that they were unable to complete the adoption of identified children before 31 October, 2013.  I am conscious of the strain that these prospective adoptive parents have experienced due to recent events which could not have been foreseen. Since this issue was brought to my attention, officials in my Department have been seeking a way to address the problems which resulted from the sudden change in Russian legislation. Considerable efforts have been made, including through diplomatic channels, to see if the problems which have arisen can be resolved.</p><p>  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect. In order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. </p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General has been sought and my Department is currently examining legislative options that might assist,  possibly through the retrospective extension of the declarations of eligibility and suitability concerned. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention. I have already met and spoken with some of those prospective adoptive parents affected by the  changes in Russian legislation and have undertaken to keep them informed of any developments.</p><p>  Work is also ongoing in relation to a possible  bilateral agreement on inter country adoption with Russia. Following my invitation to the Russian Ministry of Education and Science in August, a delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland for discussions and the meeting of the 22nd October 2013 was very positive with detailed discussions  between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the HSE. At the meeting significant progress was made and my Department has committed to reverting to the Russian side in the coming weeks with further detailed proposals in an effort to address both Russian and  Irish legal and administrative requirements to the greatest degree possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-12a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111200054#WRA00700"><p>The Programme for Government commits to developing early childhood care and education as resources allow, and the Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining the childcare support programmes implemented by my Department - the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the new After-school Childcare programme.  </p><p>  It is recognised that intensive and targeted early childhood services have the potential to significantly enhance the life chances of many children. In the region of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to provide for a number of childcare support programmes which assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.  More than 100,000 children benefit from these programmes each year. </p><p>  For example the Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low or relatively modest incomes. For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and qualifying income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.</p><p>  The Childcare Education and Training Support programme provides &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services in both the community and commercial sectors for qualifying Solas and Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees and students.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.  In 2013, a new strand of this programme was introduced to provide after-school childcare to certain social welfare recipients entering employment.  It is proposed to further augment the programme with a new strand for certain community employment participants in 2014.</p><p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  Almost every pre-school service in the State (more than 4,300) is participating with over 68,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, availing of free pre-school programme in the 2012/2013 school year.   </p><p>  In line with the Programme for Government, I succeeded in maintaining the universality of the free pre-school year, including securing an additional funding requirement of &euro;9.8m in 2012 to address increased demand due to an increase in births since 2009.</p><p>  The programme includes a number of additional provisions which take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  In addition, to improve the services available to children with special needs, my Department is working with the Office of Disability and Mental Health in the Department of Health, to examine how supports to facilitate the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream pre-school settings can be improved.</p><p>  My Department and I, along with key stakeholders including the HSE, are currently progressing an 8-point Pre-School Quality Agenda. The actions being implemented are designed to ensure the highest standards of care for children in pre-school and to ensure that parents and practitioners can have confidence in the regulation of the sector. I further believe that this Agenda must be implemented and higher standard of quality ensured, in order to provide the key building blocks for any further extension of universal childcare provision, including any proposal to introduce a second free pre-school year, which as I have indicated on numerous occasions is my ultimate objective.</p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes as well as proving significantly beneficial to children with special needs. In addition a second pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and likely generate 4,000-5,000 new positions, albeit mostly part-time. The benefits of introducing a second year were further referred to in the recent OECD reports on Ireland.</p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, with the additional cost broadly in line with the cost of the current one year provision, which is &euro;175 million.  This funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating.  However I would hope that this proposal is one which Government could continue to work towards as our public finances recover.</p><p>  Finally, I have recently received the Report and recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group which I established to advise my Department and myself on the preparation of Ireland first-ever Early Years Strategy. Longer term objectives for early years care and education, including extension of universal early years provision, supports for children with specific needs and ongoing improvements in quality will be further addressed in this Strategy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-12a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111200054#WRA01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23, 31 and 41 together.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The queries raised by the Deputies refer to the recent cases of Roma children who following Garda action were removed under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 and provided with foster care while investigations took place. </font></p><p>  Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides for the removal of a child to a place of safety by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in situations where there is immediate and serious risk. In such circumstances An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must, as soon as possible, place the child into the care of the HSE.</p><p>  Where a child is received into care in circumstances such as these, the HSE are required, following initial assessment, to either return the child to their parents, if is safe to do so, or make an application to the District Court for an Emergency Care Order at the first available opportunity. A District Court may grant an Emergency Care Order if there is reasonable cause to believe that there is an immediate and serious risk to the child or that there is likely to be if they were to leave the care setting. Emergency Care Orders have a limited duration and a fuller hearing must be convened within prescribed timelines. </p><p>  Child protection is a complex and sensitive issue. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE are often required by law to deal with complex situations and to make immediate decisions when dealing with concerns which come to their attention. The HSE and An Garda S&iacute;ochana have worked in the broad context of Children First to develop closer working relationships designed to ensure more effective provision of child welfare and protection services. Regular meetings of the statutory agencies are convened at both local case management and national senior management level aimed at ensuring good communication and cooperation channels. The HSE and An Garda Siochana also operate joint protocols to ensure good practice in the area of child protection. It is important however, to review incidences, such as these two cases, to ensure that practices and procedures are in line with best practice.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Along with my colleague Minister Shatter, the Minister for Justice and Equality, I determined that there should be examination of the involvement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE in these two cases. I  asked Mr. Gordon Jeyes, National Director, HSE Children and Family Services, to provide me with a report on the HSE actions in respect of the two cases. Minister Shatter also requested similar reports from the </font>Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  <font color="#2F2F2F"> in relation to the actions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, has initiated an investigation of the actions of the HSE in relation to these cases, under the provisions of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. The Ombudsman for Children has also agreed to undertake an investigation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actions, under Section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  I can confirm that I have received the reports for each of the cases from HSE Children and Family Services. The reports have been referred to the Ombudsman for Children Ms Emily Logan, for her consideration.</font><font color="#2F2F2F">The Ombudsman for Children is an independent statutory authority and will independently assess the actions of the HSE.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In respecting the independent investigations of the Ombudsman for Children, which will now take their course, it would be wrong of me to comment in detail on the cases or the reports received from the HSE. I look forward to the conclusion of the process and to addressing the independent findings of the Ombudsman for Children, once she reports on her investigations.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">As I have said I acknowledge the distressing situation for the two families involved from these events and the surrounding publicity. I have requested that both the HSE and voluntary family support services would be available to the families if they wish to avail of these services.</font></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-12a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111200054#WRA01400"><p>An audit of neglect cases in Roscommon, Waterford and Dublin South-East was completed by the HSE and a composite report published on 20 June 2013. A decision was taken within the HSE to produce this composite report as the best means of disseminating the learning from the three projects. </p><p>  From the outset, it was the intention of the HSE that the neglect audit would comprise a number of phases and that the initial pilot phase would inform a more significant National Audit of Neglect Cases.  Therefore the audit published in June last was not simply a once off exercise but constitutes one element of a wider process to improve practice in relation to such cases across the country. Phase 1 of this process was the initial audits undertaken by Ms Lynne Peyton, Consultant in Children&rsquo;s Services and Social Care. Phase 2 comprises a series of workshops for social work staff and managers nationwide. There will be a minimum of two workshops in each region presented by Ms Peyton in conjunction with Ms Helen Buckley, who will be covering the learning emerging from the Child Death Review Process. I have been informed by the HSE that the first of these workshops have taken place. The phase 2 workshops will be followed by the phase 3 National Audit of all neglect files which will be informed by the findings of phase 1 and the outcomes of the phase 2 workshops.  A definitive timeline for completion of all phases is dependent on completion of phase 2 at regional level and thereafter individual local audits.  It follows that different regions will complete their audits at different times. My Department will be liaising with the HSE over the coming months to monitor progress.</p><p>   I note that the recently published Interim Report of the Child Care Law Reporting Project, being undertaken on an independent basis by a team led by Dr Carol Coulter, has found that neglect is the primary cause of children being taken into care. This indicates that the issue of neglect is  receiving significant attention in the child welfare and protection system. In this regard, it is reasonable to surmise that the report undertaken in Roscommon, Waterford and Dublin South East, along with the application of the learning by the HSE, has reinforced the awareness of the significance of neglect in the context of the adequate care and protection of children across all areas.</p></reply>

The latest report on the Analysis of School Attendance Data, which I launched on behalf of the NEWB on the 6th November, is for the 2010 &ndash; 2011 school year.  This latest data shows a continued improvement in student attendance from 2009/2010 and previous years. The number of school days being missed is at the lowest for the five year period 2006/07 &ndash; 2010/11 and while further improvements are required the continued positive trend over recent years is to be welcomed. This evidence demonstrates the positive impact of targeted investment programmes and the progress that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of schools, parents, statutory and support services.  </p><p>  Within the NEWB, the Education Welfare Service has specific responsibility for the Board&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. I am advised by the NEWB that the Education Welfare Service worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer (EWO) and a multidisciplinary approach in order to address the issues of school attendance. The Education Welfare Service has a current staffing complement of 74 officers delivering front line services. The NEWB is developing Guidelines for schools on the Preparation of Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. Formal guidance will provide further clarity to schools in terms of responsibilities under the Act but should ultimately provide practical support towards enabling children to maximise their attendance, participation and retention in schools. The Board intends to complete this work within the current academic year. </p><p>  The NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service; Home School Community Liaison Programme (comprised of 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (comprised of 124 school cluster projects involving 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. As part of this process the NEWB is also reviewing the basis on which the Education Welfare Service is configured and a full consultation process is underway with staff and their representatives to reconfigure service delivery based upon the needs of children and young people. I see this strategic national approach to attendance, participation and retention as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.</p><p>  The decision by Government to provide for the amalgamation of the NEWB and its services into the new Child and Family Agency upon its establishment will further consolidate the development of services aimed at children and provide opportunities for more effective working amongst the range of professionals involved in such services. The Child and Family Agency will have a specific legislative remit to promote educational outcomes through its existing educational welfare programmes and will work closely with the education sector and families by means of its network of Educational Welfare Officers, the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme.</p></reply>

This is a strategic approach for years to come and I welcome the incremental approach set out in the report.  </p><p>  Development of the Early Years Strategy is underway.

For a small number of children, residential care is considered the most suitable option to meet their needs.  A very small number of children and young children with specialised needs are placed in a High Support or Special Care Unit. </p><p>  The HSE has advised that Rath na n&oacute;g High Support Unit  has now closed.  One other Unit provides High Support placements, that is Crann&oacute;g Nua.  This Crann&oacute;g Nua unit will cease providing High Support services once the current residents complete their interventions and move on to their next placements.  This closure is expected to take place in May 2014.  Crann&oacute;g Nua will then undergo refurbishment works to bring the standard of the facilities up to the level of security required to provide Special Care services from that location by the end of January 2015.  This development will increase Children and Family Services capacity to provide Special Care services on a national basis from seventeen places currently, up to twenty-five by end of Jan 2015.  The HSE advise that with the further developments in progress at Crannog Nua and at Gleann Alainn, it is expected that the overall capacity for the provision of Special Care services by Children and Family Services nationally will increase to thirty four places by end 2015.</p><p>  The HSE is committed to designing and developing a comprehensive continuum of care services to meet the divergent and complex needs of all children in care.  The HSE has advised me that it is currently undertaking a national review of all residential care and this will be completed during the first quarter of 2014.  The HSE assures me that this review will assist in mapping and reinforcing the various stages along the continuum of residential care provision in the HSE as well as identifying where gaps may exist.  A National Director of Residential Services has been appointed to take the review forward and ensure the strategic development of such services with all necessary allied supports necessary.</p></reply>

The existing strengths of community based approaches to supporting families have informed this policy direction and, in particular, the contribution of the network of 106 Family Resource Centres around the country.</p><p>  The intention is that the new Agency will have a stronger family support function which will encompass both the existing family support obligations imposed by the Child Care Act 1991 (and currently discharged by the HSE) along with the important work undertaken by the Family Support Agency.  The Child and Family Agency Bill contains strong functions relating to family support (as set out at Section 8(1)(c)) and community development activities (set out at Section 8(1)(d)), such as those provided by the Family Resource Centre Programme.  In addition, Part 8 sets out the framework for the funding of outside providers of services and again provides scope for the funding of community development initiatives which would include Family Resource Centres (specifically Section 59(8)).  This Part establishes the statutory basis for the funding of such programmes.  It also provides for the development of regulations and guidance which will further elaborate the precise governance and administration arrangements which will be put in place by the new Agency.</p><p>  It is acknowledged that Family Resource Centres are non-profit making organisations with a strong community involvement and ethos.  The arrangements implemented by the Child and Family Agency will support the objective of providing effective and co-ordinated supports to families and communities, while building upon the local, community role of Family Resource Centres.  I can assure the Deputy that the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade, and that a community based approach to service provision will form an integral part of the new Child and Family Agency.  I will communicate further with the Deputy in this regard when the Child and Family Agency Bill commences Report Stage on the 20th November. </p></reply>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.  A number of submissions were received as part of the Committee's consultation process.  Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First.  Since then my Department and I have carried out international research and held further consultations with experts and key stakeholders, including other relevant Departments and statutory agencies, to discuss and review the complex matters arising and the development of the final Bill. </p><p>  It is also essential that the related and relevant legislation is compatible with and will complement the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Act.  The drafting of the Children First Bill is under way.  The proposed Children First Bill will place obligations on certain professionals and other people working with children to report suspected child protection concerns to the HSE/Child and Family Agency and also for certain relevant professionals to assist the HSE/Child and Family Agency in the assessment of any reported cases.  Organisations will also have legal obligations relating to child safety planning. </p><p>  It is also intended to place the Children First Inter-Departmental Group on a statutory basis, to be chaired by my Department.  This will allow my Department to identify any areas that require to be developed or improvement, which will be particularly important during the initial implementation phase of the Bill.</p></reply>

It is a power given to the Gardai and is not operated by the HSE per se.  However, where Section 12 is invoked, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must, as soon as possible, place the child into the care of HSE.</p><p>  Section 12 however operates in conjunction with other duties and obligations of the HSE.  Where a child is received into care in circumstances such as these, the HSE are required, following initial assessment, to either return the child to their parents, if is safe to do so, or make an application to the District Court for an Emergency Care Order at the first available opportunity.  A District Court may grant an Emergency Care Order if there is reasonable cause to believe that there is an immediate and serious risk to the child or that there is likely to be if they were to leave the care setting.  Emergency Care Orders have a limited duration and a fuller hearing must be convened within prescribed timelines.</p><p>  The provisions of the Child Care Act are under continuous review by my Department and policy and legislative changes are considered as necessary.  The provision of and use of the particular section of the Act referred to by the Deputy is the subject of an investigation by the Ombudsman for Children following two recent high profile cases.  The Ombudsman will independently assess the circumstances of these cases and be free to raise any questions of relevance to the events that occurred. </p><p>  Section 12 of the Act has been in operation for some considerable time.  I believe it is important to emphasise the importance of the provision in the context of immediate danger to a child.  I am further of the view that the Child Care Act 1991 carries considerable safeguards in respect of these powers, as it should.  I am also of the view that we should not confuse issues related to practice in the overall appropriateness of the provision and it is these issues relating to practice which the various reports are required to tease out.  Notwithstanding that, I have reiterated that, on receipt of a report from the Ombudsman for Children, the Gardai and the HSE will be in a position to examine any practice implications and I will be in a position to examine any policy or legislative implications, which might arise.</p></reply>

Children who are referred to as homeless generally fall into three groups: children who mainly reside with their families but due to an emergency, need care and accommodation immediately, children who are defined as at risk of homelessness and children who are found to be &quot;sleeping rough&quot;.  Children who present as homeless or in need of emergency accommodation are assessed as children in need of welfare and protective services and are provided with an appropriate response. </p><p>  My Department commissioned the Centre for Effective Services to undertake a review of the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy published by the Department of Health and Children in 2001.  The review found that there had been significant improvements in the service response to children presenting as homeless in the last ten years and that the range and standard of services has improved over the past decade and this appears to have contributed to a decrease in the number of children and young people accessing services through the homeless sector. </p><p>  The Children's Research Centre, Trinity College Dublin also undertook research &quot;Young People's Homeless and Housing Pathways&quot;  which involved three phases of data collection over a 6-year period with homeless children and young people in Dublin City.  This period of contact and engagement provided a unique opportunity to gain insight into the processes that steered participants &quot;journeys&quot; into, through and out of homelessness, as well as their perspectives on their homeless and housing situations over that time.  This study found that  for many young people homelessness can be resolved if they receive the necessary services and supports and access to stable housing with appropriate supports, at the earliest possible juncture.  Both reports identify the need for early interventions and the importance of timely assessments and the provision of adequate services. </p><p>  Services for young people aged between 15 and 17 who come to the attention of emergency and homeless services need to be flexible as these young people are often vulnerable and at risk and are typically more challenging in the provision of care.  They may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; have mental health or learning difficulties; have lived casually among friends and peers; and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services.  Additionally they will often need support beyond their 18<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p><p>  The Crisis Intervention Service provides an out-of-hours emergency social work assessment to children aged under 18 years who are out of home and in need of care or accommodation.  The service operates across Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours, such as Garda&iacute; or hospital and ambulance service personnel.</p><p>  Outside the greater Dublin area, the HSE operates an Emergency Place of Safety Service whereby Garda&iacute; can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk utilising their powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 out of hours.  This service involves placing a child in a family setting where they stay until the next working day when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  The service is designed to ensure that children presenting as 'at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety, a foster care placement, thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting.</p><p>  Section 5 of the Child Care Act provides that the HSE may provide accommodation for a child in need of accommodation, who does not need to be taken into care.  The HSE has developed and is now implementing a policy on the use of Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  This policy addresses the needs of young people aged 16 and 17 presenting to the HSE Children and Family services in need of accommodation.  The HSE has advised that 14 and 6 children were supported under Section 5 in HSE South Region and HSE West Region, respectively.   No data is available for Dublin Mid Leinster or Dublin North East regions.</p><p>  Clearly, while progress has been achieved,<font color="#2F2F2F"> some challenges in relation to a</font>ccess to mental health and intellectual disability services for children in crisis or out of home remain.  Service responses for children aged 16-18 need more focus as does the management of the transition between child and adult services.  My Department has engaged with the HSE and the National Educational Welfare Board, along with the Departments of the Environment Community and Local Government, Education and Skills, Social Protection and Health seeking their views on how the recommendations of &quot;Every Child A Home&quot; relevant to each sector are being or might be brought forward.</p></reply>

In keeping with my Department's responsibilities for children and young people, this new five-year Children and Young People's Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way which will comprehend the continuum of the life-course from infancy through to early and middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.  It will be the overarching Framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.  This overarching Framework will provide the basis for more detailed strategies including a new youth strategy. </p><p>  It is envisaged that the new youth strategy will focus on ensuring greater coordination in policy and provision across government for young people aged 10 &ndash; 24 years.  It  will aim to:</p><p>- enhance the development, participation and support of young people in this age cohort; </p><p>- be responsive to current and emerging issues such as youth employment ; and</p><p>- provide greater coordination in youth provision and related services for young people across departments, agencies and the youth sector; </p><p>  Work is under way in preparation for the development of the youth strategy.  My Department has commissioned a review of international best practice to advance our understanding of the impact of youth services in the lives of children and young people.  The conclusions of this study, the findings of the Growing Up in Ireland Study of my Department along with the other studies underway will inform the development of the strategy.  The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, which includes representatives of national youth organisations, Government departments, the Education and Training Boards and other statutory agencies involved in youth matters, has a key role in advising my Department on issues to do with how youth work practice and services can advance key desired outcomes for young people's well-being that are central to the strategy.  The strategy will further take account of the findings of the Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding which is nearing completion in my Department.</p><p>  The next stage in the development of the youth strategy will include a consultation process with stakeholders and young people.  It is planned that the youth strategy will be substantially progressed for completion early in 2014.</p></reply>

This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and working on a comprehensive<b></b>Pre-School Quality Agenda.  My comprehensive Pre-School Quality Agenda will seek to support and assure higher standards in pre-school services.</p><p>  I have identified eight key areas which I consider to require urgent attention.  These are:</p><p>- Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible</p><p>- Strengthening the national inspection system</p><p>- Introducing new protocols on regulatory compliance and enforcement </p><p>- Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance</p><p>- Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services</p><p>- Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services </p><p>- Implementing the new National Quality Standards</p><p>- Supporting implementation of the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum</p><p>  Legislation to strengthen the current inspection regime and underpin the Pre-School Quality Agenda is expected to be enacted before the end of the year.  This legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level. Under the proposed new system, all pre-school services will have to be registered in order to operate.  Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with; and the threat of removal of registration will be available.  This system will, for the first time, provide for timely and effective regulation and enforcement of standards in pre-school services, backed up by statutory registration. </p><p>  Work on the establishment of the new Children and Family Agency has provided an opportunity to address the absence of a coherent national approach to the regulation of childcare services.  The HSE has been working towards developing the Pre-School Inspectorate as a nationally coordinated service.  A practical outcome of this work has been the introduction of Standard Operating Procedures to address inconsistencies and provide clarity and transparency to early years services.</p><p>  Over recent years, a number of areas of the country have had either no inspectors or an inadequate number of inspectors.  The HSE is recruiting five new inspectors to cover existing gaps in Louth, Dublin South / East Wicklow, Cavan / Monaghan, and Sligo / Leitrim / West Cavan.  In addition, I have received approval from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the staffing numbers in the new Child and Family Agency to provide for extra posts to further strengthen the Inspectorate.  Some additional funding for this was provided for in Budget 2014.</p><p>  New National Quality Standards for pre-school services will be launched very shortly.  These Standards will complement the existing Pre-School Regulations replacing previous explanatory notes; and will set out the quality outcomes and supporting criteria against which inspection under the pre-school regulations will be measured.</p><p>  The level of qualifications held by staff dealing directly with children in pre-school childcare services is an important factor in determining the quality of pre-school provision that the facility can deliver.  I believe, therefore that it is important to introduce qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  This will be an important development as at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the ECCE programme are not subject to any minimum qualification requirement.</p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year to Level 6.  It is also my intention to require all pre-school assistants and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service to hold a minimum qualification at Level 5.  These new requirements will apply from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>  The implementation of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear Practice Frameworks, developed to support quality early childhood care and education in Ireland, is an important initiative in the development of quality childcare services.  Both Frameworks are based upon extensive research evidence on best practice in early childhood education and care.  The successful implementation of the Frameworks on a nation-wide level will require all childcare practitioners to have a thorough understanding of quality early years provision.  I announced in Budget 2014 the introduction of a new mentoring service which will employ graduates in early childhood care and education who will work directly with services to improve quality and support the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum.   </p><p>  The HSE has begun the process of publishing retrospective pre-school inspection reports on-line, and this process will continue over the coming weeks and months.  All new inspection reports from 1st July 2013 are being published on-line on completion.  Pobal is hosting the publication of the pre-school inspection reports, and they are available on the Pobal website.</p><p>  On foot of Budget 2014, I will be allocating &euro;4.5m in Exchequer funding to support the implementation of the Pre-School Quality Agenda which will seek to support and assure higher standards in pre-school services.  Of this funding, &euro;1.5m is provided to support staff training to meet the new qualification requirements.  &euro;2.5m will be provided to support the new mentoring service.</p></reply>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.  A number of submissions were received as part of the Committee's consultation process.  Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. </p><p>  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives.  In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I recently met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen.  I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area.  These discussions will inform the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.  </p><p>  The framework is now focussed on the safety and protection of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; cooperation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and finally mandating key individuals to report child abuse known to them.  The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities.  The Bill will create a range of responsibilities and duties on organisations and individuals and these will be detailed in the legislation.  The precise requirements on varying sectors, organisations and individual professions is currently under consideration and part of an ongoing process.</p><p>  It is also essential that the related and relevant legislation is compatible with and will complement the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Act.  In parallel with the development of legislative proposals to put <i>Children First </i>on a statutory footing, significant work has been undertaken to achieve full and consistent implementation of the revised Guidance.  I have established a <i>Children First</i> Implementation Inter-Departmental Group (CFIDG) to bring central government oversight to the implementation process.  The direct responsibility for implementation rests at organisation level in line with the Guidance and the proposed legislation.  </p><p>  Each Department represented on the Group has prepared a <i>Children First</i> Sectoral Implementation Plan.  These Implementation Plans are designed to be high level documents setting out implementation requirements for the parent Department and for agencies under its aegis which have contact with children and young people.  The Plans set out the mechanisms in place, or to be put in place, including training requirements, to support the continued implementation of <i>Children First</i> Guidance at sectoral level.  They are for a period of one year, at which time they will be reviewed.  The Sectoral Plans are available on the relevant Department websites.</p><p>  My Department and the CFIDG continue to work in cooperation with the Children and Family Services of the HSE in relation to key issues and priorities such as the provision of information, advice and materials to relevant organisations/sectors to support recruitment and training arrangements by employers and organisations in respect of their staff.  These discussions also include the development of a website and the implementation of a communications strategy in relation to <i>Children First</i>.</p></reply>

On 14 October 2013 I officially launched the construction project with the event taking place on the campus in Oberstown.</p><p>  The timeline for the project will see the first three new residential units available in the third quarter of 2014, which will be used to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities (currently St. Patrick's Institution) to the Oberstown campus and will deliver on the Government's commitment to end the practice of detaining children in St. Patrick's Institution.  An additional three residential units, to be delivered in 2015, will be used to replace existing accommodation on the Oberstown campus which has reached the end of its useful life.  The development will also provide associated education, recreation, security and other ancillary facilities and will result in all detention services for children being delivered in a single location, maximising the scope for ensuring best practice standards using the children detention school model and for operational efficiency.  The project is due to be fully complete by the third quarter of 2015.  </p><p>  In additional to the capital project, my department and I are overseeing a further programme and reforms aimed at enhancing the effective management and capacity of services on the Oberstown campus.  A recruitment process has recently been carried out for the appointment of a Campus Manager for the Oberstown site, who will report to the Board of Management.  The Campus Manager will be appointed shortly and this person will be responsible for driving the reforms that are currently taking place in Oberstown.  I see this appointment as a crucial element of the reform of the children detention service, which will complement the development of new services on the campus for all children under 18 years of age.  In addition, I will shortly be presenting a set of amendments of the Children Act 2001 to the Oireachtas which will provide a mechanism for the merging of the three existing Children Detention Schools into a single legal entity.  These governance reforms will complement the on-going work over recent years to develop integrated care policies and shared services across the Oberstown campus.  I wish to further advise that a care staff recruitment programme has been sanctioned by Government and will shortly be commenced in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service, with the aim of deploying the new staff in Oberstown for orientation and training on a staged basis from early 2014.  </p><p>   In order to ensure a safe and stable transition to the new children detention school campus during 2014, a comprehensive business planning process has recently commenced for the delivery of services for all children under 18 in Oberstown.  This will include appropriate input from the Irish Youth Justice Service which is based in my Department, the Irish Prison Service and other agencies including the Probation Service, the Courts Service, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE Child and Family Support Services, which will shortly become the Child and Family Agency.  </p><p>  In line with an agreement made at the Labour Relations Commission earlier this year, agreement has been reached with staff representatives on the appointment of a third party arbitrator to oversee a joint staff/management review of the operation of the campus staffing roster in Oberstown which was implemented in February 2013.  This review commenced last month and it is ongoing.  It is my intention that the review will be completed as soon as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-12a.68.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111200055#WRB02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 388 together.</p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place.  During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place.  The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows those who held a valid  declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt before the commencement of the Act to continue with an adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must have completed the process by the 31st October 2013. </p><p>  By their nature transitional provisions must be time limited, and it was considered by the Government at the time, and the Oireachtas, that three years was a reasonable period of time to finalise an adoption which was in process when the Adoption Act 2010 came into force.  The Hague Convention sets out important safeguards to be implemented by member countries so as to ensure that the rights of children and families are protected and there is prevention of illegal, irregular, premature or ill prepared inter country adoptions.  Ireland has ratified the Hague Convention and under the Adoption Act 2010 the Convention has force of law in Ireland.  The provisions of the Adoption Act 2010 sought to balance the desire for a reasonable period of transition with the overall commitment  to the mutual support amongst member countries for the operation of the standards and safeguards in inter country adoption outlined in the Convention.</p><p>  One particular concern that has coincided with the expiry of the transitional provisions provided for in Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, is the position of a  small number of applicants who were at a late stage in adopting from Russia when  changes to Russian legislation were enacted which meant that they were unable to complete the adoption of identified children before 31 October, 2013.  I am conscious of the strain that these prospective adoptive parents have experienced due to recent events which could not have been foreseen.  Since this issue was brought to my attention, officials in my Department have been seeking a way to address the problems which resulted from the sudden change in Russian legislation.  Considerable efforts have been made, including through diplomatic channels, to see if the problems which have arisen can be resolved.</p><p>  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect.  In order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. </p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General has been sought and my Department is currently examining legislative options that might assist, possibly through the retrospective extension of the declarations of eligibility and suitability concerned.  As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention.  I have already met and spoken with some of those prospective adoptive parents affected by the  changes in Russian legislation and have undertaken to keep them informed of any developments.</p><p>  Work is also ongoing in relation to a possible  bilateral agreement on inter country adoption with Russia.  Following my invitation to the Russian Ministry of Education and Science in August, a delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland for discussions and the meeting of the 22nd October 2013 was very positive with detailed discussions  between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the HSE.  At the meeting significant progress was made and my Department has committed to reverting to the Russian side in the coming weeks with further detailed proposals in an effort to address both Russian and Irish legal and administrative requirements to the greatest degree possible.</p></reply>

Aftercare is the support put in place to meet the needs of a young adult who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living.  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships, secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training.  The provision of an appropriate aftercare service has been highlighted as a key element to achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.  The HSE has advised me that at the end of September 2013, there were a total of 1,477 young adults in receipt of an aftercare service nationally, of whom 372 were receiving the service in the Dublin North East HSE region. </p><p>  I am delighted to inform the Deputy that last week I obtained cabinet approval to my Department's policy proposal to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  It is proposed to amend the Child Care Act, 1991 to provide for a statutory right to the preparation of an aftercare plan.  The proposed amendment will provide clarity around eligibility and the arrangements for preparing, reviewing and updating the aftercare plan and monitoring of young care leavers that do not participate in the process.  Work on developing the General Scheme for this legislative amendment will now commence in my Department.I believe that the measures approved by Government will strengthen existing practice and improve the outcomes for young people, especially those who are more vulnerable.</p></reply>

During my visit to the US in  September last, I spoke with several key contacts in the US Congress including Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi and Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King.  I also spoke with leading Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressmen Mark Amodei, Spencer Bachus and Doug Collins.</p><p>  In addition, I met with representatives of Irish community groups as well as some community members who are undocumented.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties they face as a result of their undocumented status.  I am more determined than ever to continue to work to find a solution to their plight.</p><p>  A resolution of the situation facing the undocumented Irish in the United States remains a priority for the Government.  The Government also attaches great importance to seeking provision for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the &ldquo;E-3&rdquo; visa scheme to include Irish citizens.  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.    </p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.   </p><p>  The focus has since shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues and a key factor here remains convincing the Republican House Majority of the importance of making progress.</p><p>  It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.  It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will remain a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress has been preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.  This was clear from my discussions in September and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.   </p><p>  I am determined to continue to deploy all necessary resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.  In support of this ongoing effort, a delegation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington DC last month for a programme arranged by our Embassy during which they met with key members of Congress and with Irish-American community representatives.    </p><p>  In addition to my contacts in New York in September, I visited Washington DC on 11-12 July and held a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, including with key members of the House of Representatives and Senate.  These included Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee, and Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>  I also had meetings with the offices of House Speaker John Boehner and of House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy.  In addition, I met key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.    </p><p>  I reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  </p><p>  The Embassy in Washington continues our intensive follow-up work with all of our contacts on Capitol Hill and particularly with the Republican House leadership.  It also continues to coordinate our lobbying efforts with our Irish-American community representatives.</p><p>  I  wish to acknowledge the critically important role being played by these community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.</p></reply>

Dr Haass has committed to concluding his work by December and, to that end, he has embarked on an ambitious programme of work.  I am very supportive of the process of consultation with wider society undertaken by Dr Haass and his team.

The Egyptian authorities are still reviewing this case. A decision to extend their period of detention for a further fifteen days was taken initially on 1 September and again on 14 September to allow more time for investigations to be completed. On 29 September, their detention was extended for a further 45 days. I understand that they are due in court today for a review of the detention orders.</p><p>  I raised their situation with the Egyptian Foreign Minister yesterday, 11 November, during a telephone conversation. I expressed my concern at the length of their detention, the uncertainty surrounding the specific charges against the siblings and the length of time that it was taking for a decision to be made as to whether they would be tried or released. I also expressed our sincere hope and expectation that the situation will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future. It would be inappropriate, however, for the Government to demand their release as this would constitute interference in the judicial process of another country.  </p><p>  The Embassy is in regular contact with the appropriate Egyptian authorities. Ambassador Moylan called on the Assistant Minister for Consular Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on 22 September to discuss the case and on 10 October she met with officials from the Ministry of Justice. On 22 October she met with the Office of the Prosecutor General in Cairo.  </p><p>  Since their detention the Embassy has been allowed consular access to the siblings on a number of occasions. The first consular visit took place on 20 August. Further consular visits were made to one sibling on 24 August, 8 September, 15 September, 10 October, 24 October, 30 October and 10 November and to the three sisters on the 25 August, 5 September, 18 September, 13 October, 24 October,30 October and 10 November.</p><p>  Consular officials in Dublin met with family representatives, on 17 August, 19 September and 24 October 2013 and continually update them on all developments in the case.  However, the family has been made aware of the limitations faced by the Embassy in such cases and that we are prohibited from becoming involved in legal matters which is a matter for their legal representation.   </p><p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to advise Irish citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Egypt at this time. If, against our advice, Irish citizens decide to travel to Egypt they should register their travel and contact details with the Department via their website.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of observers for such missions.  The aim is to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums.   </p><p>  The Department carried out a comprehensive review of the election observation roster earlier this year.  Following a public call for applications, and an appraisal process against published criteria, 200 individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience were selected to serve on a new roster.  This new roster came into effect on 15 May 2013 for a period of five years.  A reserve panel was established from which applicants will be drawn should any roster members leave the roster during the five year period.    </p><p>  The Department nominates roster members to participate in missions organised mainly by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  These nominations are made following invitation by the organisations concerned.  A number of international organisations, including the Carter Centre, the National Democratic Institute and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, also recruit directly for participation in election monitoring.  It is open to persons interested in participating in such missions, who are not on the Department&rsquo;s roster, to apply directly to these organizations if they are interested in participating in their missions.</p></reply>

Working in partnership with other donors and with Governments in our partner countries, Ireland has made a significant contribution to development and the fight against poverty. In the past decade there have been important improvements in human development in each of our partner countries, as measured by the UN Human Development Index.   </p><p>  The media can be a powerful force for positive change and democratic transformation in our partner countries.  It plays an important role in advancing a pro-poor development agenda, enhancing domestic accountability and tracking the effectiveness of international development cooperation.</p><p>  Ireland provides support to media organisations in a number of our partner countries. In Tanzania, for example, support is provided to the Tanzania Media Fund (TMF) which provides grants to media professionals and institutions in order to improve journalism standards, including investigative journalism.  From 2008 to 2012, TMF provided assistance to more than 400 media organisations and journalists and reported important quality improvements and accountability impacts from its interventions.</p><p>   In Zambia, support is provided to the Media Institute of Southern Africa to support community radio stations, a source of over 80% of Zambians&rsquo; current affairs information and an important tool for enhancing domestic accountability. Through this work, media freedom is promoted and citizens, even those in the remotest parts of the country, have access to information.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s new policy for international development, <i>One World, One Future,</i>  launched earlier this year, recognises the powerful role a diverse, pluralistic and professional media environment can have in providing access to information and debate, and in ensuring the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression as recognised in international human rights law.  The policy highlights the important contribution media can make in holding Governments to account and includes a commitment to support initiatives that can strengthen their role in key partner countries.</p></reply>

The Antarctic Treaty System comprises the Antarctic Treaty, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (&ldquo;CCAMLR&rdquo;), the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals 1972 (&ldquo;CCAS&rdquo;) and the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection 1991 (&ldquo;the Protocol&rdquo;).</p><p>  Preparation for signature and ratification by Ireland would impose substantial administrative burdens on several Government Departments. In the case of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this would include the co-ordination of the national approach to accession negotiations via the Inter-Departmental Group on the Antarctic Treaty, the preparation and submission of the relevant Memorandum to Government and other legal instruments necessary for ratification.  Subsequent to ratification, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would have responsibility for coordinating the servicing of any meetings of States Parties or related events and conferences.    </p><p>  Though no formal cost benefit analysis has been undertaken on the impact of adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, the associated administrative burden would be substantial with the process not providing any significant practical benefit. While the objectives and achievements of the ATS are of considerable importance and the commitment of the signatories is to be commended, Government Departments, including my own, have to concentrate their diminishing resources on their core business and areas of priority national interest and concern and are not in a position to assume the administrative burden associated with the ATS signature and ratification process and ensuing treaty obligations at the present time.</p></reply>

Full details of the budget are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website  (<i><font color="#0000FF">www.budget.gov.ie</font></i>  ).  I set out below a copy of Annex C for the Deputy&rsquo;s convenience.</p><p><b>ANNEX C</b></p><p><b>&euro;500m TAX PACKAGE BUILDING BUSINESS AND CREATING JOBS</b></p><p><b>25 MEASURES FOR JOBS AND GROWTH </b></p><p>  Jobs and Growth remain the top priority.  New businesses tend to be the greatest contributors to job creation.  For new business success it is necessary to incentivise entrepreneurship, innovation and investment.  Existing small businesses also require support to grow and create jobs.  Access to credit and finance for SMEs is vital for economic growth and is central to Ireland&rsquo;s continuing recovery.  </p><p><b><i>Entrepreneurship</i></b>   is a powerful driver of economic growth and job creation. It creates new companies and jobs, opens up new markets, and nurtures new skills and capabilities. </p><p><b><i>Innovation</i></b>   accounts for about two thirds of the sources of economic growth and innovative firms tend to be the greatest contributors to job creation. </p><p><b><i>Investment</i></b>   is essential for the survival and growth of Small and Medium Enterprises.</p><p><b><i>Credit and Finance</i></b>   Ensuring enterprises and in particular SMEs have access to an appropriate flow of finance from a diverse range of sources is a major policy issue.</p><p><b><i>Opportunity</i></b>   Small and new business needs the opportunity to grow and flourish.  To that end it is important to create a level playing field for legitimate business by tackling unfair competition from the shadow economy.  </p><p>  A package of 25 measures has been developed which focuses on the business drivers outlined above in order to realise the maximum benefit from the minimum cost. </p><p>  The 25 measures with their intended targets are outlined below:<blockquote><b><i>Promoting Entrepreneurship</i></b></blockquote><b>1.</b><b><i>Capital Gains Tax Relief for re-investment of previous asset disposals in productive assets</i></b></p><p>  The measure applies where an individual makes an investment in assets for use in a new productive trading activity in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 and subsequently disposes of this investment no earlier than three years after the date of investment. The CGT payable on the disposal of this new investment will be reduced by the lower of the CGT paid by the individual on a previous disposal in the period from 1 January 2010 and 50% of the CGT due on the disposal of the new investment.</p><p><b>Target:  </b>  To encourage individuals to re-invest the proceeds of a previous asset disposal into new productive trading or a new company and therefore to encourage new business and to keep capital focussed on business and the creation and maintenance of employment.  </p><p><b>2.</b><b><i>Start Your Own Business (SYOB)</i></b></p><p>  This measure is being introduced to encourage individuals who are long-term unemployed to start their own unincorporated business.  A two year exemption from income tax up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 per annum is being provided for individuals who have been unemployed for at least 15 months prior to starting their own business.  </p><p><b>Target: </b>To encourage individuals to move from unemployment to self-employment.  <b></b><blockquote><b><i>Stimulating Investment</i></b></blockquote><b>3.</b><b><i>Enhancement of Employment and Investment Incentive </i></b></p><p>  The initial 30% relief available for investments under the Employment and Investment Incentive is being removed from the high earners restriction for a period of 3 years. This restriction limits the amount of tax reliefs that can be claimed by high income individuals.  The EII provides that a maximum of &euro;150,000 can be invested by an individual per annum. Therefore, by lifting the restriction on the initial 30% relief, these investors should be encouraged to invest more funds in the EII and improve the availability of funds to SMEs.</p><p><b>Target:</b>   To increase investment in Irish SMEs that are focused on job creation and expansion.</p><p><b>4.</b><b><i>Enterprise Securities Market &ndash; Transfers exempt from Stamp Duty </i></b></p><p>  This proposal involves removal of the Stamp Duty charge (currently 1%) on shares listed on the Enterprise Securities Market (ESM) of the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE).  The ESM is the ISE&rsquo;s market for growth companies.  It has been specifically designed to meet the funding needs of companies at earlier stages in their development.</p><p><b>Target:  </b>It is intended to encourage more investors to back SMEs, thereby increasing the supply of equity available to them for growth and job creation.  It may also encourage entrepreneurs and growing businesses to use the ESM to aid growth and job creation.</p><p><b>5.</b><b><i>Inclusion of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the Immigrant Investor Programme</i></b></p><p>  Following the successful launch of the REIT product in Ireland it has been agreed with the Department of Justice to propose the inclusion of REITs as an investment option in the Immigrant Investor Programme. </p><p><b>Target: </b>  To encourage investment in REITs.<blockquote><b><i>Financing Growth</i></b></blockquote><b>6.</b><b><i>Trade Finance</i></b></p><p>  The Trade Finance Initiative would involve a tailored measure to support the growth of the export sector in Ireland thereby increasing investment, economic activity and employment. Discussions are taking place with the EIB to consider the feasibility of support being granted by the bank to underpin additional trade by Irish companies.</p><p><b>Target: </b>  To assist Irish exporters and businesses to increase exports and grow.</p><p><b>7.</b><b><i>Credit Review Office &ndash; Increase Threshold</i></b></p><p>  Increase in the threshold for applications that can be reviewed by the Credit Review Office from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3m. The increase in the number of reviewers sanctioned in Budget 2013 will ensure that the increased workload arising from this measure will be handled in a timely and comprehensive manner.  </p><p><b>Target: </b>  To meet new lending demands from borrowers currently banked with non-trading banks and banks which are strategically exiting the Irish SME lending market.</p><p><b>8.</b><b><i>SME Communications Strategy</i></b></p><p>  Communication strategy to increase awareness of State supports amongst SMEs. This strategy will also ensure that there is a greater awareness amongst businesses of the soon to be re-launched credit guarantee scheme.</p><p><b>Target: </b>To inform<b></b>  SMEs who are eligible for State supports but may not be aware of it or how to go about obtaining it.</p><p><b>9.</b><b><i>Building Business Capacity</i></b></p><p>  A programme, consisting of 2 days dedicated off site training together with expert mentoring support, to enhance SMEs business and financial capacity in relation to understanding and utilising a broader range of financial products, as well as equipping them with the necessary tools to make a strong business case when applying for credit. The programme will be launched on a pilot basis with 1,000 SMEs taking part next year.</p><p><b>Target: </b>  To assist micro and small business to grow.<blockquote><b><i>Encouraging Innovation</i></b></blockquote><b>10.</b><b><i>Research and Development Tax Credit - Outsourcing</i></b></p><p>  The limits on the amount of expenditure on R&amp;amp;D outsourced to third parties which can qualify for the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit is being increased from 10% to 15%.</p><p><b>Target: </b>  This should help to assist small companies in performing R&amp;amp;D, as they are more likely to need to outsource because they may have insufficient resources in-house for certain functions.  It should also support the outsourcing of discrete R&amp;amp;D tasks to smaller businesses.</p><p><b>11.</b><b><i>Research and Development Tax Credit &ndash; Base Year</i></b></p><p>  It is intended ultimately that the base year will be phased out entirely over time and as resources allow.  In the interim, the amount of expenditure eligible for the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit on a full volume basis (without reference to the 2003 base year) is being increased from &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000.  </p><p><b>Target: </b>  This measure will reduce the impact of the base year on companies who had significant R&amp;amp;D expenditure in 2003 and it will assist smaller companies to access the credit without reference to the base year.  The phasing out of the base year, when complete, should improve the overall international competitiveness of the regime. </p><p><b>12.</b><b><i>Research and Development Tax Credit &ndash; Key Employee</i></b></p><p>  The key employee provision is in place in order to assist companies to attract key talent, by allowing the company to transfer the tax-free benefit of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit to employees who meet certain conditions.  Some minor changes will be made to this element of the tax credit to remove some barriers to take-up that were identified in the review of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit which took place this year.</p><p><b>Target: </b>This measure is to help R&amp;amp;D performing companies to attract key talent.  <b></b><blockquote><b><i>Cash Flow</i></b></blockquote><b>13.</b><b><i>VAT &ndash; Increase cash basis to &euro;2m</i></b></p><p>  The annual VAT cash receipts basis threshold for small to medium businesses is being increased from &euro;1.25m to &euro;2m with effect from 1 May 2014</p><p><b>Target: </b>  To assist small to medium businesses in the critical area of cash-flow and to reduce administration.<blockquote><b><i>Protecting Compliant Business by Tackling the Shadow Economy</i></b></blockquote><b>14.</b><b><i>VAT Anti-Fraud Measures </i></b></p><p><i>(i) Disallowance of input VAT</i> &ndash;<b></b>Business which have not paid for supplies (in full or part) within a six month period will be required to repay the VAT claimed on those supplies. (ii)  <i>Quick reaction mechanism</i> &ndash; Allows Revenue to apply an emergency and temporary reverse-charge measure to certain goods or services to address sudden and massive VAT fraud. (iii) <i>Requirement to keep specific records</i>   &ndash; Provision is being made to allow Revenue issue a notice requiring businesses to procure specific information in circumstances where Revenue has reasonable grounds for believing that the records specified might assist in identifying VAT fraud.</p><p><b>Target: </b>  To protect compliant business from unfair competition by tackling the shadow economy.  To assist small business in the area of cash flow by encouraging prompt payments.    </p><p><b>15.</b><b><i>Excise and Energy Tax Anti-Fraud Measures </i></b></p><p><b><i>Tobacco </i></b><blockquote>This gives Revenue the power to search baggage and other receptacles for illicit tobacco products.  Revenue can require a person suspected of illegal selling of tobacco products to stop, and to permit and facilitate a search of any baggage or other thing the person has with them, and which is reasonably believed to contain tobacco products concerned in the offence.<br /><br /><b><i>Alcohol </i></b><br /><br />  Alcohol products that are held on unlicensed premises may be made liable to forfeiture under excise law and to seizure by Revenue.<br /><br /><b><i>Mineral Oil Tax Law </i></b><br /><br /><b></b>  (i) Supplier liability to mineral oil tax in the case of a supplier who knowingly supplies Marked Gas Oil to persons who have no legitimate use for it. (ii) Revocation and renewal of mineral oil traders&rsquo; licences in the case of suppliers who knowingly supply Marked Gas Oil to persons who have no legitimate use for it.</blockquote><b>Target: </b>  To protect compliant business from unfair competition by tackling the shadow economy.  </p><p><b>16.</b><b><i>The Appeal System for  Tax Matters</i></b></p><p>  Reform the role, functions and structure of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, who hear appeals against assessments, decisions and determinations of the Revenue Commissioners on a variety of taxes, and of the tax appeals system.</p><p><b>Target: </b>  To ensure an enhanced and cost effective appeal mechanism for tax cases, providing transparency and increased certainty for the taxpayers.<blockquote><b><i>Tourism and Hospitality Sector</i></b></blockquote><b>17.</b><b><i>VAT &ndash; Retention of 9% VAT rate</i></b></p><p>  The reduced rate of 9% VAT for tourism related services and goods has been a boost to the tourism sector but is due to expire at the end of this year.  The 9% VAT rate is being retained.</p><p><b>Target: </b>  To support and encourage growth in small businesses in the tourism sector.</p><p><b>18.</b><b><i>Reduction of Air Travel Tax to 0%</i></b></p><p>  The rate of the Air Travel Tax will be reduced to 0% from 1 April 2014.  The Air Travel Tax was introduced in March 2011 and since then a general rate of &euro;3 has applied. </p><p><b>Target:</b>   To encourage the development of new routes leading to increased capacity and traffic flows.

Their &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013), which is published on the Revenue website (<i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>), includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products.    This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products at importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation in this jurisdiction between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.</p><p>  Considerable success is being achieved in combating the illegal tobacco trade. In 2012, a total of 95.6 million cigarettes and over 5 tonnes of tobacco were seized and there were 132 convictions for smuggling or sale of illicit tobacco product.</p><p>  Research, undertaken by IPSOS MRBI for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive, indicates that the incidence of illicit packs of cigarettes in the State in 2011 represented 15%. A similar survey for 2012 indicated an incidence of 13%. While these data would suggest that the problem is being contained, the Revenue Commissioners recognise the ongoing need for vigorous action against the importation and sale of illicit tobacco products, and are committed to ensuring that the work continues to receive the high priority that has been accorded to it to date.</p><p>  Revenue is conscious that those involved in the illegal trade in tobacco are constantly striving to avoid detection by seeking out new ways of smuggling the illicit product and putting it on the market, and that its own response needs to be agile and adaptive in combating this criminal activity to take account of this. </p><p>With regard to staff numbers I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection. Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place.<b><font color="#FF0000"> </font></b></p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009.  Revenue&rsquo;s overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581(FTE) at the end of 2008 to its current level of 5,740 (FTE).  Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. The Revenue Commissioners are committed to ensuring that, despite the staff reductions, enforcement work against the illicit tobacco trade will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible taking account of emerging business priorities.</p></reply>

In terms of tax policy generally, Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax rate of 12.5% on trading income is akin to a brand and is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy of creating an enterprise friendly environment to attract jobs and investment to Ireland.  One of the main features of the rate is its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base. </p><p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s suggested approach would involve significant complexity and could undermine the attractiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax offering.</p><p>  Further, there could also potentially be State Aid issues if we were to target tax payers in the manner suggested.</p></reply>

SEPA is an EU initiative that will change the way that these payments are processed across Europe. SEPA will allow payment systems users to make euro-denominated retail electronic payments to payees located in any of the participating countries, using a single payment account and a single set of payment instruments   SEPA comes into full effect on 1 February 2014 and businesses will need to ensure that payroll, direct debit and accounting systems are SEPA-ready.</p><p>  The implementation of SEPA within Ireland is overseen by the National Payments Plan (NPP) Steering Committee, which was established in 2012 to modernise the way payments are made in Ireland. In this regard, an NPP-SEPA sub-group has been formed, consisting of representatives of consumers, businesses, Government and banks. This sub group provides an avenue for the discussion of any issues that arise in the process of migrating to SEPA.</p><p>  I understand from the Central Bank that there is considerable assistance available to the SME sector in the context of migrating their payment business to SEPA. </p><p>  A national information campaign using radio, internet and national newspapers has been run in the current year, in parallel with similar campaigns run by some of the banks providing retail payment services in Ireland.  </p><p>  The &lsquo;www.readyforsepa.ie&rsquo; website has also been set up to provide SEPA-related information to corporates of all sizes as well as to individual consumers. All of the banks providing retail payment services in Ireland have comprehensive SEPA information on their websites, as does the Irish Payment Services Organisation, the representative body for the payments industry in Ireland.</p><p>  A series of presentations on SEPA has also been made over the course of this year to the SME sector, in conjunction with representative bodies such as ISME, Chambers Ireland, IBEC, etc.</p><p>  All SMEs have at this stage been contacted by their banks about SEPA migration, and the banks all have dedicated SEPA migration teams in place to help their customers move to the new payment standards introduced by SEPA. Providers of payments software packages to the SME sector are also available to assist in the SEPA migration process.</p><p>  It is also noteworthy that not all SMEs will be affected by SEPA - only those who submit bulk payment files to their banks for processing, of which there are about  30,000.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners have made payment options available which provide property owners with options to pay in phased payments during 2014 or in one single debit from their current account as late as 21 March 2014.  Property owners are fully entitled to change their chosen payment method for 2014, and also entitled to apply for a deferral of the tax if they consider that they are entitled by reference to their financial circumstances, by completing the LPT return on paper or online.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the range of payment options are such that no property owner has to pay their LPT liability for 2014 before the end of this year unless they choose to do so and I note that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners informed the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that large numbers of property owners have been successfully filing returns and selecting a payment option for 2014.  The Committee was also informed that, due to the volume of queries regarding Local Property Tax (LPT) payment methods from people who filed their 2013 return on paper, the Commissioners have extended the 2014 paper LPT filing deadline from 7 to 14 November 2013.</p></reply>

For example, Revenue has answered in excess of 580,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 200,000 letters or emails since March 2013.  Revenue has further advised that because LPT is a new tax it is difficult to anticipate service volumes, and as a consequence the number of agents required.   </p><p>  Revenue has acknowledged that exceptional delays in accessing the helpline, which is the primary contact point for LPT queries, were experienced by some callers in the days immediately following the issue of the 2014 notifications.  Access was also hampered on an intermittent basis on those days by technical issues in the service provider&rsquo;s telephony system, which have since been resolved. </p><p>  In response to the demand for service, Revenue ensured that extra resources were deployed to the helpline within two days of the peak period occurring and also deployed extra resources to its own internal support service to cater for the more complex queries.  It has put contingency plans in place to further rapidly increase the number of agents on the helpline should it be necessary to do so.  In total there are now 200 agents fully deployed to LPT telephone call handling.  In addition to the extra staff deployment, callers can now leave their telephone contact details on the system in preference to waiting for service and will receive an out of hours &lsquo;call back&rsquo; from the LPT team.  Revenue has extended the helpline opening hours from 9am to 5pm to 8am to 8pm since 6 November and will maintain these hours for the peak filing periods.</p><p>  Revenue has also extended the paper filing date by one week to 14 November to allow people further consider their 2014 payment method before committing their preferred option to Revenue.   The combined initiatives of additional deployments, extended opening hours and the extended paper deadline have already significantly reduced the waiting times on the helpline.  </p><p>  Finally, I again commend Revenue for the excellent work it has done in taking LPT from concept to a fully functioning tax in such a short period of time, including the drafting of legislation, the building of a brand new property register, the provision of customer service to such a large volume of taxpayers and crucially the contribution of &euro;215m to date to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

Revenue used the opportunity to clearly outline the various payment options that are available for LPT as a guide to people who might want to change their payment method for 2014, given that it is a full year liability.  Revenue also needs to ensure it has enough lead in time to process all phased payment applications in advance of 1 January so that taxpayers may spread their payments over a full year.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s intention in providing seven different payment methods for LPT is to ensure people have the flexibility to meet their liability in a way that best suits their individual circumstances, whether by a single payment or on a phased basis spread out over the year.  The options are:</p><p>- Phased payment by monthly Direct Debit</p><p>- Phased payment by Deduction at Source from salary, pension or certain Government payments</p><p>- Single Debit Authority, which is a mandate to debit a bank account <i>once </i> only</p><p>- Credit Card</p><p>- Debit Card</p><p>- Cheque or Postal Order.</p><p>- Service Providers, namely An Post, Payzone and Omnivend </p><p>  On the specific case to which the Deputy refers, Revenue issued a 2014 payment reminder letter to the person in question via his ROS inbox.  The letter included a Property ID, PIN and confirmed the amount due for 2014.  As the person in question is a &lsquo;multiple property owner&rsquo; the letter confirmed the total amount of LPT due on all of his properties.</p><p>  It is noted that the person in question wishes to meet his 2014 LPT liability by using his debit card.  While this is his choice, Revenue has clearly stated on numerous occasions that any such card payment will be debited immediately.  This is the nature of card payments.  If the person does not want to pay before 1 January it is open to him to choose one of the other options listed above.</p><p>  As I previously advised the House, all property owners with a debit card also have a bank account.  If the property owner concerned wishes to pay in full in one payment in 2014 from the bank account which is attached to his debit card, he has the option to do so.  I can confirm that if he uses this option his account will not be debited until 21 March 2014 unless he specifies an earlier payment date.  To do this property owners should select and complete the option entitled &quot;single debit authority&quot;, which is the second option, when filling out their property tax return online.  The Commissioners advise that the single debit authority payment option is drawn on a person's current account in the same way as a debit card payment.</p><p>  Finally, the person&rsquo;s concern about the Christmas retail market is noted. However, Revenue has provided payment options which allow people not to pay their full LPT liability until well after Christmas, or in phased payments throughout 2014, should they so choose.  I believe that the arrangements are more than adequate and I do not intend to intervene.</p></reply>

This application form was returned on the same date informing the person that all refunds of excise duty on fuel are made on a yearly basis and to re-apply in February 2014.  The information leaflet published by Revenue on the scheme (VRT 7) makes it clear that the relief from excise duty on fuel can only be claimed on an annual basis (section 7.3.3).  Revenue has no control over information published on other websites and the reference quoted does not reflect Revenue policy.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Central Repayments Office handles a very high volume of claims under all the provisions of the scheme. For operational and efficiency reasons, fuel claims can only be processed on an annual basis. Claims for shorter periods would risk giving rise to delays as the volumes to be processed would be tripled and the amounts involved would be relatively small in the majority of cases.  Furthermore, accepting refund claims for an annual period is the normal practice which applies to other tax refunds such as medical expenses.</p><p>  As a concession to facilitate the person (details supplied), all his shorter-term claims for the current year will be processed.  However, from 2014 onwards, yearly claims only can be accepted as explained above.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Cabinet handbook requires a statement on the likely effects of the decision sought on equality and persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be included in Memoranda to Government. Consequently, Government does consider each of these important issues at an individual policy or programme level. Furthermore, I would remind the Deputy that the State and its bodies take the provisions of equality legislation into account in the development and delivery of policies and services.   </p><p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that a distributional analysis of taxation measures is performed based on various income levels for the different categories of income earners. These categories include single individuals, married one-earner couples with no children and married one-earner couples with children. A distributional analysis which models the impacts on disposable income by income decile using SWITCH, the ESRI Tax-Benefit model, is also undertaken in evaluating various taxation options. Illustrative examples continue to be included in Budget documents. </p><p>  In future, as part of our annual Budget, Ireland will submit a draft budgetary plan to the Commission no later than 15 October. This is under Regulation 473/2013, which specifies that all euro area Member States not in a macroeconomic adjustment programme will be required to submit this plan.</p><p>  As part of the material supplied, Article 6 (3) (d) requires where possible, &ldquo;indications on the expected distributional impact of the main expenditure and revenue measures&rdquo; should be included. This distributional analysis will be conducted through the SWITCH model, as has been seen in previous Budgets.</p><p>  I feel it is important to highlight the progressive nature of the Irish taxation system when discussing matters of equality. The European Commission compares progressivity of taxation by taking the OECD tax wedge for an individual earning 167% of the average wage and dividing it by the tax wedge for an individual earning 67% of the average wage. On a rating system where less than 100 is regressive and above 100 is progressive, most EU countries have a progressivity rate of between 120 and 140. Ireland, in comparison, has a progressivity rate of 190.  While Ireland&rsquo;s progressivity rate decreased from 220 to 190 in 2012 following the changes introduced in Budget 2011 and 2012. This is still far more progressive than any other EU member of the OECD.</p></reply>

The paper suggests that a yield of 0.1% of GDP, which would be in the region of &euro;160 million, is attainable from a wealth tax where the threshold of liability is set at &euro;1 million and the tax rate is set at 0.6%.  As I have stated in reply to a number of Parliamentary Questions in the past, to estimate the potential revenue from a tax on wealth one would need to identify the wealth held by individuals, which is not possible from the data available at present.</p><p>  The paper has considered whether certain assets should be relieved or deductible for the purposes of the tax.  It argued that owner-occupied houses should not be exempt from a wealth tax, which would mean that houses could be subject both to the Local Property Tax and to the wealth tax.  The paper also argues against exemptions for business assets if the threshold for the wealth tax is sufficiently high.  Careful consideration would have to be given to such a measure.  In particular, the Government would not wish to introduce a tax which could deter the growth of enterprises in the economy.  While all taxes and potential taxation options are constantly reviewed, the Government has no current plans to introduce a wealth tax.  </p></reply>

This measure followed on from measures in the previous year&rsquo;s Budget which also supported farm expansion and the transfer of land.    Section 48 of Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from capital gains tax on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring, subject to a Commencement Order, which I made on 6 June 2013.  The terms of the relief are set out in Section 604B, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.     </p><p>  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes. The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase. </p><p>  Full relief from capital gains tax will be given where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is equal to or exceeds the consideration for the sale or the other land that is exchanged. Where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is less than the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged, relief will be given in the same proportion that the consideration for the land that is purchased or exchanged bears to the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged. </p><p>  Provision is made for the clawback of the relief where qualifying land in respect of which relief has been given is disposed of within 5 years of the date of the purchase or exchange of that land. A clawback does not apply where the disposal arises under a compulsory purchase order. </p><p>  A prerequisite to any disposal and acquisition of farm land qualifying for this relief is that an application for a farm restructuring certificate is made to Teagasc and that Teagasc grants such a certificate (that has not been withdrawn).  Guidelines relating to the application for, and the issue of, a Farm Restructuring Certificate are available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  Based on the limited information available, it is not possible to say definitively whether all conditions governing the relief are satisfied &ndash; in particular:</p><p>-   Whether the lands are qualifying lands (i.e. whether a farm restructuring certificate has been issued by Teagasc and  has not been withdrawn)</p><p>-   Whether or not the sales are as a result of a compulsory purchase order</p><p>-   Whether the full proceeds of the sales are invested in the purchase of the new land</p><p>-   Whether the person in question is an individual who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming.</p></reply>

The use of sporting facilities, including green fees charged for golf and subscriptions charged by non-member-owned golf clubs, also apply at the 9% rate.   Furthermore, live theatrical or musical performances are exempt from VAT, where alcohol drink is not available in the venue during the performance.</p><p>  Admission to and promotion of dances is liable to VAT at the 23% standard rate.  In addition, services by artists, bands and disc jockeys to a venue promoter are also liable to VAT at 23%.  The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The EU VAT Directive does not allow for the possibility of a reduction in the VAT rate to 9% for the promotion of dances and the provision of such music services.</p></reply>

Its objective is always to convey information that meets the &ldquo;<b>plain English&rdquo;</b> standard so that taxpayers readily understand their entitlements and obligations, and it has full regard to information or suggestions on an on-going basis as to how information can be made clearer.  I understand that, to strengthen its approach further, Revenue is currently preparing a protocol for customer information publications.  This protocol will include the latest National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) guidelines for presenting information in plain English.   Where major new documentation is being published (such as documents explaining changes to operation of the PAYE system) Revenue liaises with its own customer consultative panels, a range of representative bodies, in particular those representing older persons, and organisations like NALA to ensure that the language used to explain the changes is simple and easy to understand.</p><p>  In her appearance before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 7 November the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners reminded the Committee that the Local Property Tax (LPT) is the largest extension of the self-assessment system in its history.  This is a new tax, with new concepts and new language for many of Revenue&rsquo;s customers and likewise for Revenue staff.  </p><p>  Revenue has made every effort to make it as easy as possible for property owners to understand this new tax and how it will impact on them.  On the day I announced the introduction of LPT (Budget Day 5 December 2012), Revenue published Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on its website which provided details of how the tax would operate in simple English.  In fact Revenue received much positive feedback on the clarity of the information provided on their website.  This information was made available to property owners more than six months before the tax was introduced and it is updated regularly as issues requiring clarificiation emerge.  Revenue also confirmed that it had extensive engagement with many representative bodies and the Citizens&rsquo; Information Service, all of whom were provided with copies of the LPT1 form, LPT Guide and the letter to property owners.  Between March and April this year Revenue issued letters to property owners and included a LPT Guide which explained the operation of LPT and the range of options for paying the tax.  The Guide was in a &ldquo;question and answer&rdquo; answer format to make it as user friendly as possible. </p><p>  For the issue of letters to about 988,000 property owners in October, Revenue placed advertisements in national and provincial newspapers and developed a number of &ldquo;frequently asked questions&rdquo; specifically for the 2014 filing period. In addition, spokespersons were also provided for national and local media. </p><p>  I am satisfied that Revenue will fully take on board the communications related issues that have arisen over the past number of weeks and will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that key messages in its LPT and other correspondence are as easily understood as possible.</p></reply>

While the full circumstances of this case are not known it appears that the personal representative is liable to pay the balance of LPT due for 2013 and should now make arrangements to do so.  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, there is also a second property associated with the deceased person, which she declared as uninhabitable and on that basis is not liable for LPT.  Finally, if the liable person requires further information or assistance with making payment s/he should contact the LPT Helpline at 1890 200255.</p></reply>

Section 7 of the Act provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.  </p><p>  However, residential properties purchased under the various local authority shared ownership schemes will also be subject to LPT and that the liable person in these instances will be the purchaser.  This is on the basis that, under these schemes, the purchaser acquires a leasehold interest in the property for a period that exceeds 20 years.  Such a purchaser is in the same position as a property owner who purchases a residential property with a mortgage from a financial institution.  Accordingly, there is no reason why such an individual should not be liable for payment of the LPT on the property. </p><p>  I am informed by the Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessed tax and it is a matter for the person who is purchasing a local authority shared ownership residential property to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property and to make a Return to Revenue.</p></reply>

In light of taxpayer payment patterns in respect of the 2013 liability, the anticipated yield for 2013 was increased to &euro;300 million to take account of potential payments in respect of 2014.  Because 2014 is the first full year of LPT, and because there are a number of one-off factors to be included, estimates are of necessity tentative.  The 2014 forecasted yield for LPT of &euro;550 million carries forward the assumption that observed taxpayer payment patterns will continue.  It also takes account of 2014 yields most of which will be non-recurring, including the 2013 liabilities of local authorities, which were postponed into 2014; arrears and compliance activity by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to 2013 LPT and LPT yield arising from arrears of household charge.  In this regard, I am advised by the Commissioners that while compliance activity will begin early next year, approximately &euro;700,000 has already been paid since 1 July in respect of arrears of household charge/LPT and is included in the LPT Exchequer figures.</p></reply>

A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child.  This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child, as can happen with the OPFTC, is unsustainable.</p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only.  The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree.  However, having listened carefully to the views expressed by colleagues and Deputies, I have asked my officials to explore how the credit could be used by another individual, where the primary carer chooses not to, or cannot, claim it and accordingly I will be bringing forward an amendment at Committee Stage.</p></reply>

This scheme will run from 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2015 and provides for tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (exclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;675.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply.  The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.  Works carried out between 25 October 2013 and 31 December 2013 will be considered to have taken place in 2014 for the purposes of awarding the tax credit.</p><p>  As the relief is being made available by way of tax credit, only individuals who have a tax liability will be in a position to avail of the incentive.  However, any pensioner who has an occupational pension and pays tax on that pension will be able to qualify.  The credit is payable over two years in order that individuals who may pay small amounts of tax can avail of it.  In addition, any unused credit may be carried forward to future years.</p></reply>

Their objective is to apply the law in a fair, consistent and sensible manner and to treat people in an even-handed way, presuming their honesty and giving them respect and courtesy.  Where issues arise between a customer and Revenue the experience is that most can be resolved in the normal course of business by dealing with the Revenue officer handling the case and/or the supervisor.  However, to deal with circumstances where the issue cannot be resolved in this way the Revenue Commissioners have put in place formal procedures - &ldquo;Revenue Complaint and Review Procedures&rdquo; (Leaflet CS4).  These procedures provide customers with an open and transparent mechanism for making a complaint and for seeking a review if the customer is not satisfied with the response they receive to the complaint.

Specifically: the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by the 15th of October each year; draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all Euro area Member States not in a programme of assistance; and the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by the 31st of December each year.</p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before the 15th of October from now on.  Accordingly, I presented Budget 2014 on Tuesday, 15th October.  The Government also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by the 31st of December each year.  One of the most critical elements of the Budget process is the accuracy of systems for forecasting potential revenue yield in the year in question prior to the Budget actually taking place.</p><p>  In the context of a December Budget Day, the availability prior to the Budget of information on cumulative tax yields to the end of November gave a high degree of certainty to the estimation of potential outturn for the year.  For example, cumulative tax yield to the end of November 2012 was &euro;33.8bn, which represented 92% of the full year outturn of &euro;36.6bn.  On the other hand, cumulative yield to end September, at &euro;26.1bn, represented only 71.3% of the eventual outturn.</p><p>  The scope for unanticipated events which would lead to either a higher or lower than projected outturn is considerably increased in the context of an October Budget.  In addition the ability to project future yield is compromised.  Consequently, measures which would result in improvements in the availability of information or increases in the proportion of total yield already available prior to the Budget have to be considered.  The main areas where scope exists to introduce such improvements relate to the income tax Pay &amp;amp; File arrangements and on 11th October I initiated a consultation process on a revision of the existing arrangements.</p><p>  I am aware of the concerns that have been raised and will consider the results of this consultation process, which closed on Friday last, 8th November, when drafting, as a Committee Stage amendment to the forthcoming Finance Bill, the necessary measures.  I would reiterate that changes to the Pay and File regime are necessary as a result of the move to an earlier Budget Day, following the adoption of the Two-Pack and will provide increased certainty around the annual tax take.</p></reply>

The person in question was linked to a second property on the basis of records imported by Revenue from another Government agency database during the development of the Property Register.  It is now evident that the person was registered with this agency to pay certain charges in relation to the second property but was not in fact the owner.  It has since been confirmed that the property belongs to the person's parents and was duplicated on the Property Register.</p><p>  I am further advised that the LPT Return which issued in March 2013 indicated to the person that he was a multiple property owner.  Revenue received no contact from the person disputing the accuracy of his records and a compliance letter subsequently issued on 29 July 2013 in respect of the second property.  The letter clearly requested that if he was not the liable owner that he immediately notify Revenue.  The letter also advised that &ldquo;deduction at source&rdquo; would commence in the absence of a response.  Revenue received no response from the person until 20 September 2013 when he telephoned to confirm that he did not own the property and that his parents were the liable persons.  Unfortunately an instruction to deduct LPT from his salary had already issued to his employer.</p><p>  On foot of the person's telephone contact, Revenue amended the Property Register and issued a revised instruction to his employer to cease deductions.  The employer subsequently confirmed that deductions had ceased from 1 October.  A refund of &euro;50.50 is due to the person and I am assured that it will issue to him in the coming days.  Finally, Revenue has acknowledged that the linkage of the second property to the person in question during the development of the Property Register was an error.  However Revenue did communicate strongly during the initial stages of LPT that errors in the compilation of the Property Register were inevitable given the scale of the task.  Revenue also clearly requested anybody who received incorrect information in regard to their properties to contact the LPT Helpline immediately to avoid unnecessary compliance interventions.  Unfortunately in this instance the person delayed making contact and as a consequence compliance activity commenced.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that CAT is a self assessment tax ordinarily payable electronically through Revenue&rsquo;s Online System (ROS).

Interest would be chargeable on any late instalments.  Each such case would be considered on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the gift or inheritance involved.</p><p>  A beneficiary experiencing difficulty in paying CAT should contact the local Revenue office, as early as possible before the CAT becomes due, to outline his or her circumstances and to explore the options available on paying the tax. </p></reply>

Each of the banks referenced calculates on a periodic basis the LTV of the mortgages in their portfolio (generally based on indexing valuations to current values using the CSO HPI). </p><p>  In making provision for loans in arrears the banks use the indexed value of property collateral in addition to including other costs of recovery of the outstanding loan.</p></reply>

I do not believe that measures announced in Budget 2014, including the increase in Deposit Interest Retention Tax and the levy on financial institutions, had any bearing on the decisions by either bank to curtail their operations in the Irish market.  Such decisions would have presumably have been under consideration for some time and based on wider factors than these two measures.  Danske Bank will still continue to take deposits from corporate customers.  </p><p>  There is no doubt that the loss of ACC Bank and Danske Bank will have an effect on the level of competition in the Irish financial sector. However, the banks are independent commercial entities and have the right to conduct their business as they consider appropriate.  The recent commitment by RBS to the Irish market is a welcome step in the other direction, and KBC Bank has been expanding its network.  I think that it is fair to say that it is not all bad news and that the Irish financial market does offer opportunities to certain institutions. </p><p>  This Government has also take steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland.  Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, which provides for the regulation of bank fees and charges, has been dis-applied for three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland.</p></reply>

Working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland, we aim to secure both financial stability and an effective banking sector, while safeguarding the interests of customers and promoting the development of financial services.  The banking system must be the enabler of economic recovery by restoring public and market confidence in its financial health, management competence and ethical integrity.</p><p>  A comprehensive restructuring of the banking system has been undertaken to build a new core system that is fit for purpose for the economy, businesses and households by providing new lending into the economy. Major steps have been taken to address the challenges in the banking system in order to create a robust, smaller, and better capitalised banking system that will effectively serve the needs of the Irish economy and can operate on a viable basis without recourse to the State. The State completed the recapitalisations in 2011 following a credible and fully transparent stress testing exercise at an overall cost of c.41% of Irish GDP (&euro;64bn).</p><p>  Furthermore, significant progress has been made in relation to deleveraging the banking system. System wide deleveraging targets have been surpassed both in terms of amount deleveraged and impact on regulatory capital. For AIB, non-core deleveraging is now complete having achieved the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s year end 2013 &euro;20.5bn target while Bank of Ireland has completed its disposal plan and the remaining deleveraging is on target and forecast to be achieved through rundown (rather than disposal) of non-core loan books. This deleveraging will greatly assist both AIB and Bank of Ireland to re-focus their operations to areas which will support our economic recovery. The restructuring of the Irish Banking system, including the recent liquidation of IBRC, will serve to provide a secure financial system for deposits and ensure the flow of credit to Irish consumers and businesses.</p><p>  As part of a wider set of measures taken to address the liquidity and solvency issues of systemically important Irish Banks, NAMA was established in late 2009 to remove from participating banks&rsquo; balance sheets problem loans secured by property and development land, the value of which had fallen steeply. In all 5 banks (AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Irish Nationwide, Anglo Irish) participated in the scheme.</p><p>  NAMA acquired &euro;74bn (nominal value) of loans for &euro;32bn representing an overall discount of 57%. NAMA paid for the loans through the issue of Government Guaranteed Senior Debt (95% of the cost) and unguaranteed subordinated debt (5%). NAMA has redeemed &euro;7bn, to date, in Senior Debt and is on course to meet its bond redemption target of &euro;7.5bn by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

These investments include Better Capital Ireland Fund (total fund size &euro;100 million, transaction signed Q1 2013), Carlyle Cardinal Ireland Fund (total fund size &euro;300 million plus, transaction signed Q1 2013) and BlueBay Ireland Corporate Credit (total fund size &euro;450 million, transaction signed Q3 2013) as well as a transaction entered into with Silicon Valley Bank (transaction signed Q2 2012) whereby SVB committed to lending $100 million to the Irish technology sector.  Since the respective transactions were signed with NPRF, each manager has set up a Dublin office, recruited senior team members, integrated the Irish platform within their wider international business and begun to develop local market awareness of their platform and investment offering. These activities have positioned the managers as important new players in the Irish market and as alternative sources of funding to Irish businesses. </p><p>  By its nature, establishment of a new business activity and capability takes some time. However the managers&rsquo; activities have generated significant dealflow to date. Across the four different managers over 200 investment opportunities have been reviewed and this has resulted to date in the funding of 6 transactions. A large number of potential transactions are at various stages of underwriting and the NTMA is pleased with the high quality and scale of dealflow generated by the managers. None of these funds has acquired any loans from or transacted with the domestic Irish Financial institutions. </p><p>  The NTMA intends to publish a report each year regarding investments made by the ISIF, including an assessment of economic impact. </p><p>  The NTMA is currently working on further commercial investment opportunities in the SME sector that will meet the strategic objectives and investment strategy of the ISIF.</p></reply>

If veterinary surgeons provide dog grooming services other than in the course of their profession the services are liable to VAT at the standard rate.  The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.

In such circumstances the liable person should write to LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Ennis, Co Clare, clearly setting out how the overpayment arose.

On the specific case to which the Deputy refers, Revenue has confirmed that it received an incomplete LPT 1 Return for 2013 that did not indicate either a liable person or a property valuation.  Revenue did however receive payments in respect of both 2013 (&euro;157 Band 3 &ndash; Half Year) and 2014 (&euro;315 Band 3 &ndash; Full Year), which were based on the estimated LPT liability. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that LPT is a self-assessed tax and the onus is on the liable person to calculate the tax due based on the market value of the property and that the estimate should only come into play in circumstances where Revenue seeks to collect the tax due in the absence of a return being filed. </p><p>  In regard to the question of over valuation, Revenue has confirmed to me that it has no record of any correspondence from the person in relation to the issue.  However, I am advised that Revenue has now made direct contact with the person in question to explain the process in regard to refunds of LPT.

This scheme will run from 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2015 and provides for tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.  There is no VAT relief under this scheme. Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (exclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;675.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.  The work must commence on or after 1 January 2014 and be carried out during 2014 or 2015.</p><p>  Homeowners must be Local Property Tax compliant in order to qualify under the Incentive, while building contractors must be tax compliant in order to carry out works.  The scheme will be administered through Revenue&rsquo;s online systems. Contractors will be required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried and will also be required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works. Homeowners will be able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and will also claim the relief through those systems.  </p><p>  The installation of a rainwater harvesting system will be included for the purposes of this scheme. </p></reply>

Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the number of policy holders subscribing for medical insurance is estimated to have reduced from 2,297,000 to 2,123,000 over the same period; a reduction of 174,000 persons, or 7.5%. Hence, demand for private medical insurance has been relatively resilient in the face of sharp cost increases. </p><p>  Individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely, which adds further complexity to any attempt to calculate or estimate the numbers that might forego medical insurance cover going forward.</p></reply>

This followed an extensive consultation process where over 200 submissions were received from consumers, consumer representative bodies, industry and other representative bodies.  A Feedback Document and Consumer Guide to the CCMA have also been published on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website which can be accessed at <i><i>www.centralbank.ie</i></i>.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that the CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  It seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:</p><p>- ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower&rsquo;s arrears situation;</p><p>- ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;</p><p>- support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and </p><p>- ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating. </p><p>  The main changes to the CCMA include:</p><p>- Requirement on lenders to have a communications policy, which must be ratified at Board level, that will protect borrowers against unnecessarily frequent contacts and harassment, while ensuring that lenders can make the necessary contact to progress resolution of arrears cases;</p><p>- A new requirement for lenders to provide the Standard Financial Statement (SFS) at the earliest opportunity, and to offer assistance to borrowers with completing it. In addition, lenders can now agree with the borrower to put a temporary arrangement in place to prevent the arrears from worsening while the full SFS is being completed and assessed;</p><p>- Where there is no other sustainable option available, lenders can now offer an arrangement to distressed mortgage holders which provides for the removal of the tracker rate, but only as a last resort, where the only alternative option is repossession of the home. The arrangement offered must be a long-term, sustainable solution that is affordable for the borrower;</p><p>- Co-operating borrowers must now be given at least eight months from the date arrears first arise before legal action can commence and at the end of the MARP process, lenders will be required to provide a three-month notice period to allow co-operating borrowers time to consider their options, such as voluntary surrender or an arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act, before legal action can commence;</p><p>- Greater clarity around when a borrower is considered to be co-operating and, in recognition of the serious impact of being classified as not cooperating, a new requirement that lenders must provide a warning letter giving at least 20 business days&rsquo; notice to the borrower, outlining the implications of being classified as not cooperating and providing specific information on how to avoid this classification;</p><p>  Transparency for borrowers has been improved through increased information requirements for lenders, including more detail in the MARP booklet on:</p><p>- how the alternative repayment arrangements offered by the lender work and their key features;</p><p>- explanations of other options such as voluntary surrender or trading down;</p><p>- explanations of the meaning and implications of not co-operating;</p><p>- summary information on a lender&rsquo;s potential use of confidentiality agreements;</p><p>- information on the borrower&rsquo;s right of appeal;</p><p>- a link to keepingyourhome.ie, where borrowers can get further information and assistance; and </p><p>- summary of the lender&rsquo;s communications policy. </p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that, where a borrower believes that their lender has not complied with or in any way disregarded the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, he/she may make a complaint to their lender.  The lender must seek to resolve the borrower&rsquo;s complaint in line with the complaints handling process set out in provisions 10.7 to 10.12 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.</p><p>  Each lender must also have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower to appeal in relation to a decision of the lender, including:</p><p>a) Where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender and the borrower is not willing to enter into the alternative repayment arrangement;</p><p>b) Where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement to a borrower; and</p><p>c) Where a lender classifies a borrower as not co-operating. </p><p>  For this purpose, each lender must establish an Appeals Board to consider and determine any such appeals submitted by borrowers.  </p><p>  If the borrower remains dissatisfied following the outcome from the complaints or appeals process, he/she may then refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p></reply>

Abuse is defined in the 2002 Act and includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect and any other act or omission which results in serious impairment of the physical or mental health or development of the child or serious adverse effects on the child's behaviour or welfare.  At the end of October, the Redress Board had finalised 15,966 applications, resulting in 14,934 awards.  The Redress Board does not have statistical information on the number of allegations of sexual abuse contained in the applications considered or the number of persons against whom allegations were made.   </p><p>  In accordance with section 13(6) of the 2002 Act, an applicant who accepts an award from the Redress Board must agree in writing to waive any right of action that they may have against the State or a contributing congregation.  Section 13 also allows for the payment of awards in instalments.  </p><p>  Section 28(6) of the 2002 Act provides that a person shall not publish any information concerning an application or an award made under the Act that refers to any other person, including an applicant, relevant person or institution by name or which could reasonably lead to the identification of any other person, including an applicant, a relevant person or an institution referred to in an application made under the Act.  </p><p>  The 2002 Act provides that applications coming before the Redress Board are treated in a confidential manner.  This confidentiality is required in order to protect the identity of applicants and because the Redress Board, when considering an application, is not permitted to address any issue of fault or negligence arising out of the evidence given in an application and is not empowered to make a finding of fact relating to fault or negligence in relation to evidence submitted with an application.  Section 28(5) of the 2002 Act does provide for the disclosure of information in certain circumstances to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to an appropriate person within the meaning of the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998.</p><p>  Following publication of the Ryan Report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established a dedicated phone line for persons who wished to provide information relating to criminal behaviour connected with what the report revealed.  As of 22 October, 2013, 181 calls have been received on the Garda helpline.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out investigations and submitted 15 investigation files to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).  The DPP directed no prosecution in the case of fourteen of them.  The DPP directed a prosecution in one case.  One additional investigation is nearing completion and will be the subject of submissions to the DPP.</p></reply>

The procedures however include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.</p><p>  All schools are now required to immediately commence the necessary arrangements for developing and formally adopting an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the new procedures.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March, 2013.</p><p>  The NCSE published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/2014 school year in June of this year.  </p><p>  The NCSE has also now published details of the additional SNA allocations which have been made to schools since the initial allocations were made to schools in June. The NCSE published details of these revised allocations on 21st October, 2013.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy currently has 2 approved SNA posts.</p><p>  I wish to explain that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the revised SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them. In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers. </p><p>  The staffing and redeployment arrangements for all schools are published annually on the Department website. The arrangements for the current school year are set out in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the website. </p><p>  My Department has just recently published the arrangements for access to the supplementary panel for the 2014/15 school year.  These arrangements are set out in Circular 0057/2013 which is available on the website.</p><p>  Redeployment panels are drawn up on a diocesan basis for Catholic panels, diocesan/united diocesan basis for Church of Ireland panels and on a national basis for other patron bodies.  The detail relating to numbers on individual redeployment panels is placed on the Department website when the panels are published each year.  My Department updates the progress of the panels on the website on a regular basis.</p><p>  Over the last five years approximately 2,500 surplus permanent teachers have been redeployed, an average of 500 each year. Over 4,500 fixed term (temporary/substitute) teachers were placed on supplementary panels during this period (2,800 of which were in the last 2 years). </p><p>  Preparation for the staffing and redeployment process for the 2014/15 school year is currently underway in my Department.  The size of the redeployment panels will not be known until early in 2014.</p></reply>

In a Vote this size, it is not unusual for actual expenditure, at a given point in time, to be at variance with the profile of expenditure prepared at the beginning of the year. Net projected current expenditure of &euro;6.186 billion at the end of October 2013, was running &euro;114 million or 1.8% behind the profiled figure of &euro;6.3 billion, mainly due to the following factors:</p><p>a) Superannuation payments were running &euro;56 million (6%) behind profile, with teacher and VEC/IOT staff retirements being less than originally profiled. Based on superannuation payments to date, there could be a possible underspend in the region of &euro;60 million at year-end on these subheads. The overall 2013 allocation for superannuation expenditure is &euro;1,128 million;</p><p>b) Teacher/SNAs Payrolls were running &euro;20 million (0.6%) behind the profiled figure of &euro;3.07 billion; </p><p>c) Grants to Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) in respect of Student Support are running &euro;17 million (6%) behind the profiled figure of &euro;945 million. This is a timing issue, based on the levels of monies tranched to SUSI. It does not relate to the payment of grants to students. It will not result in an end-year underspend;</p><p>d) Grants to Universities and Institutes of Technology are running &euro;19 million behind the profiled figure. This is a timing issue based on claims received from the Higher Education Authority to date. No end-year underspend is anticipated.</p><p>e) Expenditure on a range of other miscellaneous subheads is running &euro;2 million behind profile. As indicated by me in the context of the announcement of Budget 2014, projected superannuation savings on the Education Vote are being offset against upward pressures in relation to final Redress payments to victims of institutional child abuse and additional provision for supporting children with special needs for the current academic year.</p><p>  My Department is carefully monitoring all expenditure on my Vote as the year-end approaches and, with careful Vote management, I expect overall expenditure to come in on target.</p></reply>

These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works. The current practice is to use a guideline of 80 sq. metres as the standard size for a general primary school classroom. This space allows for the inclusion of two en-suite toilets and in room storage. Due to the varied nature of subject provision under the post-primary curriculum, the guidelines for classroom size in a new or refurbished post-primary school are more complex and can vary from 49 sq. metres for a general classroom up to 136 sq. metres for some of the larger specialist subject rooms.</p><p>  In the case of existing schools and given the limitations of existing buildings, site conditions and funding availability, it is not always possible to achieve the level of accommodation that is provided with a new school design.  For example, ensuring the availability of sufficient playground space can be much more difficult particularly in town and city locations. However, such limitations can often be addressed through the use of a school's general purpose room together with the arranging of access to local community facilities and amenities.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0010/2013.</p><p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum. It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.</p><p>  I can confirm that an application for assistive technology support for the child referred to by the Deputy has been received in my Department. This application is currently being processed. Further information has been requested from the SENO and a response will issue to the school as soon as possible thereafter, once this information has been received.</p></reply>

The Action Plan sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in all schools.  These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyber bullying, are addressed.</p><p>  In September, I launched new National Procedures on Anti Bullying which will be adopted and implemented by all schools.  The new procedures include a specific reference to cyber bullying.  I have also made available funding for anti-bullying training for parents which is being run jointly by the National Parents Council (primary and post primary).</p><p>  My Department has supported awareness raising initiatives, including Safer Internet Day 2013, an initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people, which will be repeated in 2014.</p><p>  In addition, the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has commissioned research which is currently in progress on the prevalence and impact of bullying linked to social media on mental health and suicidal behaviour among young people.</p><p>  Central to promoting safer use of the Internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyber bullying incidents.  The continued implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas and build on my Department's current strategy to ensure that internet safety is mainstreamed throughout schools' teaching, learning and other practices.  Resources are available on www.webwise.ie and include guidelines on developing Acceptable Use Policies.</p></reply>

The SPHE curricula aim to foster self-worth, self -confidence and respectful relationships and place a particular emphasis on developing a sense of personal responsibility for one's own behaviour, feelings and actions.</p><p>  The issue of smoking is addressed in the 'Personal Safety' strand of SPHE, in the context of equipping students with the skills to recognise and withstand inappropriate peer pressure and to identify the dangers of substance abuse. For example, SPHE students at Junior Cycle explore the health and social implications of smoking and identify some of the reasons why young people smoke. Students are also helped to identify ways in which smoking can be avoided. Enabling students to make informed decisions and choices is an inherent aim in the teaching and learning within SPHE.</p><p>  SPHE is delivered for 30 minutes per week at primary level, and for approximately 66 hours during the three years of junior cycle.</p><p>  The approach to SPHE is changing at Junior Cycle. As part of the reform of the Junior Cycle that was announced by the Minister of Education and Skills in October 2012, the key objectives of SPHE are now reflected in a number of 'Principles', 'Statements of Learning', and skills that underpin the new Junior Cycle Framework. </p><p>As part of the new 'Well-being' principle, the student experience will &quot;contribute to their physical, mental, emotional and social well-being and resilience. Learning takes place in a climate focussed on collective well-being of school, community and society&quot;. Under the new Junior Cycle Framework, pupils will be provided with opportunities to acquire the relevant skills of 'Managing Myself', 'Staying well', and 'Communicating'. Together the development of these skills will enable pupils to address the challenges they face and adapt their skills to different contexts, leading to their positive well-being.</p><p>  As part of the new Junior Cycle Framework, the NCCA is currently developing a new short course in SPHE. The SPHE short course may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three years. This short course is currently open for public consultation. The consultation process will close at the end of November. The new short course will be available to schools from September 2014. Schools will then have the option to implement the new SPHE short course, or to continue to use existing courses or to adopt an alternative approach to meeting their requirements in this area.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p><p>  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, a parent may appeal the refusal to enrol under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998. In such cases the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p><p>  My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.</p><p>  Central to my Department's approach is the aim that all children with special needs, including those with autism, should be provided with a school based provision through a mainstream class placement with supports, a special class placement or a placement in a special school which caters for children with autism.</p><p>  You will be aware that children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for assisting parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. Parents may contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  In addition to the NCSE, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p></reply>

In this regard the Deputy will be aware that guidance is a whole school activity and it does not just involve the guidance counsellor. Under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.</p><p>  Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. A framework document was published jointly by the Post Primary Management bodies and the NAPD (National Association of Principals &amp;amp; Deputies) in September, 2012 to provide guidance for school management in the allocation of teaching hours to guidance counselling in post-primary schools in the context of the decision in Budget 2012 to withdraw the provision of ex-quota guidance hours to schools. This should be of assistance to schools in terms of how they maximise guidance provision.</p><p>  My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools).</p><p>  Confirmation both from initial findings of a recent comprehensive survey by the National Centre for Guidance in Education on schools provision for guidance and from schools on the ground would suggest that even though there has been a cut in the allocation schools continue to prioritise the guidance programme and within it have increased group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle. This approach maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p></reply>

Having reviewed the proposal, it would not be possible to approve grant aid for the proposed projectAs you will be aware, the Action Plan on Bullying, the Report of the Anti-Bullying Working Group to the Minister for Education and Skills, was published in January of this year. Hie Action Plan concluded that, taking into account all of die research reviewed and submissions and presentations received, no one particular anti-bullying programme should be recommended for schools in Ireland to use. Instead, the Action Plan recommended that the emphasis should be on the core principles that should underpin a school's approach to preventing and tackling bullying. These form the basis of the new Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary schools, which were published by the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruairi Quinn, T.D., and made available to schools in September. This approach will be implemented in all schools over the coming year. The new procedures are designed to take a whole school approach to all aspects of bullying, including cyber bullying and issues of diversity and respect for difference.The Action Plan remains the basis for policy on bullying and implementation of the 12 Actions is the Department's current priority.In the context of this strategy and the need to prioritise work related to implementing the Action Plan on Bullying, I regret that it is not possible to provide funding for the BeatBullying proposal.<br /><br /><b>Yours sincerely</b><br /><br />Gavan G.

My Department therefore provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.</p><p>  Children with special educational needs may be enrolled in a mainstream school and attend all mainstream classes and receive additional teaching support through the learning support and/or resource teacher. Or they may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class, or they may enrol in a special school.  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.</p><p>  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>  The NCSE also recently published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing  a Schools. This guide is also available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  Finally, where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

A public body has no contractual ties with a subcontractor engaged by a main contractor.  Any contractual relationship is exclusively a matter between the main contractor and its sub-contractor.</p><p>  The general issue of policy relating to payments between businesses is a matter for my colleague Richard Bruton TD, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The rules governing prompt payment have been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).  This legislation acts as a deterrent to late payment by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms.  It lays down specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to public or private transactions.</p><p>  The enforcement of contractual rights, including any rights and obligations provided for by the Regulations, is a matter for individual suppliers.  If the purchaser refuses to pay prompt/late payment interest and compensation to the supplier, then the supplier can seek their own legal advice on the matter.  The supplier can also decide not to pursue prompt/late payment and compensation from a purchaser if he/she so wishes but is legally entitled to claim where such payment would apply.  I am informed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that the Regulations do not provide for any enforcement role for that Department in respect of these matters.</p><p>  I would add that I am keenly aware of the difficulties being experienced by sub-contractors in this current economic climate.  In this regard, my colleague, Minister of State Brian Hayes TD worked with Senator Fergal Quinn earlier this year on the development of the Construction Contracts Bill which was enacted on 29 July 2013 (Construction Contracts Act No 34. 2013).</p><p>  The Act seeks to address the issue of non-payment to construction contractors who have completed work on construction contracts by setting minimum standards for the payment provisions in construction contracts (whether the contracts are written or otherwise).  In addition, if a payment dispute arises, then the Act also provides for a swift and cost effective adjudication process.  This will provide a route for sub-contractors to achieve redress in the event that non-payment occurs. </p><p>  The Construction Contracts Act (relating to construction Contractors and sub-contractors) operates outside the Prompt Payment Legislation, in that the Construction Contracts Act provides further protections on prompt payment, but, the Prompt Payment legislation does apply to contractors and sub-contractors also. </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains commitments in respect of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments to improve cash flow for business and to take steps to enhance awareness of the need for prompt payments by all elements of business.  This Code which is currently being finalised by the various business representative bodies with the support of  the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is aimed at improving cash flow between businesses and also helping address the culture of late payments in Ireland.</p><p>  In addition my colleague, John Perry, T.D, Minister for Small Business recently announced a national Late Payment Information Campaign, which will start on the 9th December in Dublin before being rolled out to other parts of the country early in the New Year.</p></reply>

The levels of water in this channel flow to a swallow hole, which in turn flows underground. When the underground flow path fills to capacity there is nowhere for the water to go. The swallow hole determines the water levels in the channel.

The inclusion of social considerations in public procurement procedures, specifically at the contract award stage, is an issue that is being addressed in the reform of the procurement directives. In this regard, the revised directive, when implemented, should provide greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of social criteria at contract award stage.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the publication of the revised procurement directives, the use of a social clause requiring a building contractor to recruit a certain percentage of those employed on a public works construction site from the ranks of the long term unemployed is being piloted on a limited number of schools projects under the Devolved Schools Programme being procured by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Tenders are currently being evaluated on the first bundle of schools being procured under this Programme.  Once the first contract is awarded, the monitoring phase of the pilot programme can commence to ensure that the mechanisms included in the revisions to the contract are measuring and monitoring the targeted benefits during the execution of the contract.</p><p>  Where clauses are included in a contract requiring the successful tenderer to employ a certain number of workers as part of the performance of a contract, this must be monitored both to establish the success of the initiative but also because such a measure comes at a cost to the contractor. Were it to be ignored post-award then unsuccessful tenderers could legitimately challenge the award of the contract on the basis that their tender included the actual cost of complying with the requirement of the contract which was not reflected in the performance of the contract.</p><p>  Once this phase is completed the contract amendments necessary to meet these requirements will be included in the &euro;1.5 billion, PPP element of the &euro;2.25 billion Stimulus Programme that I announced in July 2012.  However it is not intended to include the amendments incorporating these social clauses in the public works contracts generally since there is a substantial risk that doing so would cause considerable displacement of those already in employment.  The Stimulus Programme represents an additional Government spending commitment on top of the &euro;17 billion funding contained in the &lsquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012 &ndash; 2016&rsquo; published in November 2011.  Those projects funded under the Stimulus Programme that are not PPP projects may apply the amended forms of contract, provided they are of an appropriate scale, but must first seek the sanction of the Government Contracts Committee for Construction to depart from the standard form of public works contract.</p></reply>

This support includes the provision of grants and other supports, such as mentoring.</p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund improves access to credit for microenterprises and facilitates the growth and expansion of viable businesses with less than 10 employees from all industry sectors across the country, which have been refused access to credit from the banks. Support is in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. Microfinance Ireland is delivering the Microenterprise Loan Fund, and is making available additional credit to companies in this very important sector of the economy.</p><p>  The Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) is also designed to support SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the novelty of the business model, market, sector or technology of the business, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, and can demonstrate their ability to repay the loan are the target of this scheme.  I am in the process of having the CGS independently reviewed to help improve the Scheme for all businesses, and I intend taking appropriate action as a result of the review to ensure use of the Scheme is maximised.</p><p>  Quarterly progress reports on the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme are published on my Department&rsquo;s website www.enterprise.gov.ie. The progress reports detailing the analysis and performance of both Schemes for the quarterly period ending 30th September 2013 are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

High Potential Start-up companies (HPSUs) are defined as start-up ventures that:</p><p>- Introduce a new or innovative product or service to international markets.</p><p>- Involve manufacturing or internationally traded services.</p><p>  HPSUs must also:</p><p>- Be capable of creating 10 or more jobs in Ireland and realising &euro;1 million in sales within five years of starting up.</p><p>- Be led by an experienced management team, be headquartered and controlled in Ireland and be less than six years old.</p><p>  Table 1 below outlines, where data is available, the number of jobs in Enterprise Ireland supported HPSU companies since Enterprise Ireland was established in mid-1998 together with exports by these companies as of 2012 which is the latest year for which Forf&aacute;s survey data is available.  Table 1 also provides data on the payments to HPSUs under the programme.  The HPSU Programme period is taken to include all payments against approvals made within five years of the initial HPSU approval. The export data represents the cumulative level of exports to date for each year&rsquo;s cohort of HPSUs.</p><p>  Employment data for 2013 will not be available until the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey is completed in Q4 2013 and export data for 2013 will not be available until the 2013 Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact (ABSEI) is completed in Q2 2014.</p><p>  Notes on Employment &amp;amp; Export Data</p><p>- Of the 985 HPSUs approved by Enterprise Ireland between 1998 and 2012, 2012 Forf&aacute;s Employment data is available for 66% (649).  These companies employed a total of 11,524 people (full-time &amp;amp; part-time) as of October 2012.  2012 Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact (ABSEI) export data is available for 36% (352).  These companies had exports of &euro;1.55billion in 2012.</p><p>- 86 HPSUs approved during this period (9%) went on to be taken over in trade sales.

In addition, they contribute their know-how or experience in company management and can offer valuable expertise and guidance.  Business Angels usually seek active participation in the company in which they invest.</p><p>  Business Angels can be a substitute for classical bank financing or venture capital which can be difficult to attract at the early stage of a company&rsquo;s life. They are primarily motivated by return on investment, and Business Angel involvement can often help secure access to venture capital or classical bank loans. The average initial investment by Business Angels ranges between &euro;50,000 and &euro;250,000 individually, or can form syndicates (partnerships with other Business Angels) for investment up to &euro;500,000 and beyond.</p><p>  Following a pilot initiative, the Halo Business Angel Partnership (HBAP) was formally launched in January 2008.  HBAP is a joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland, and the Irish Business Innovation Centres (&ldquo;BICs&rdquo;).</p><p>  The primary aim of the HBAP Programme is to foster and facilitate Business Angel investment in early-stage companies. This is achieved by matching pre-screened investors with pre-screened investment opportunities in start-up, early stage and developing businesses</p><p>  The HBAP Programme does not provide funding directly to companies; rather, the Programme facilitates the leverage of the investment of private investor money into early-stage companies, by matching investors with investment opportunities.  The following represents the amount of investment that the HBAP Programme has directly facilitated since its establishment in 2008:</p><p>-  2008 - &euro;2.285m</p><p>-  2009 - &euro;2.782m</p><p>-  2010 - &euro;4.026m</p><p>-  2011 - &euro;4.802m</p><p>-  2012 - &euro;5.207m</p><p>  A similar level of investment activity is targeted to be reported by the HBAN operators to Enterprise Ireland for 2013. </p><p>  To date, the total number of companies that have received investment as a result of their involvement in the HBAP Programme reached 96 by 2012.</p><p>  The peak number of jobs that have been created by companies that received investment under the HBAP Programme since its formal establishment in 2008 to 2012, is 253 based on a sample of 69 of the 96 companies (Source: Forfas Annual Employment Survey).  Employment gains of 168 at the end of 2012 were recorded by this sample.  The base number of jobs used to calculate employment gains is the number of jobs at the end of the preceding year in which the company received investment.</p><p>  The peak amount of total exports recorded by companies receiving investments through the HBAP Programme was &euro;14.734m to 2012 based on a sample of 45 of the 96 companies.  Based on the same sample, export gains were &euro;12.745m at the end of 2012.

Under the terms of a contract, signed between IDA Ireland and Connect Ireland, operational arrangements between both parties work to convert potential leads identified by &lsquo;Connectors&rsquo; into investments and job creation in Ireland. </p><p>  The role of the &ldquo;Connector&rdquo; is to make an introduction between a key decision-maker in a company considering a mobile investment project and Connect Ireland. </p><p>  Should a decision be taken to locate in Ireland, the company&rsquo;s business plan with its associated employment projections is assessed by IDA for compliance under the terms of the contract between IDA Ireland and Connect Ireland.  To date 11 such investments have met the criteria and are considered &lsquo;approved&rsquo; under the scheme.  These investments are listed on the attached tabular statement.</p><p>  This approval status means that Connect Ireland and the &ldquo;Connector&rdquo; are eligible for a financial reward under the initiative.  The reward scheme provides for up to &euro;4,000 excluding VAT per sustainable job created.  A sustainable job is defined as one which has been in existence for 2 years.  Reward payments to either Connect Ireland or to individual &ldquo;Connectors&rdquo; become payable on a phased basis, 50% when the job has been in place for at least 12 months and the remaining 50% when the job has been in place for two years.  Payments under the initiative will be made by IDA Ireland.</p><p>  The projects approved by IDA, to date, under the &lsquo;Succeed in Ireland&rsquo; initiative have the potential to create 298 jobs.  While a number of the approved investments have already commenced operations and are employing people, the exact number of jobs created will not be available until the 2013 Forfas Annual Employment survey has been completed.

We recognise that the two regimes are interlinked and indeed, there is close engagement between the Departments on matters of mutual concern. Nevertheless, DJE retains legal and policy primacy with regard to immigration and residency whereas this Department&rsquo;s function concerns employment access to the labour market.</p><p>  Economic migration policy must be flexible and responsive to different stages of economic development and to labour market conditions. An ongoing challenge for the Irish labour market is to attract from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) those skills we cannot source from within the EEA and which we need to exploit the potential for growth in high performing sectors.  The focus of the Employment Permits system is to ensure that, where sufficiently qualified candidates cannot be sourced to fill a vacancy from within the pool of available labour in the EEA, non-EEA nationals with those qualifications may be recruited to ensure that enterprise can access the skills it needs to thrive.</p><p>  The Highly Skilled Occupations List and the Ineligible Occupations List allow us to target immigrants with those skill-sets most required by enterprise.  The lists are subject to bi-annual review. These reviews draw, in the first instance, on data on employment, vacancies, job announcements and immigration and other qualitative information held in the National Skills Database, including that collated in the National Skills Bulletin, annually published, to identify imbalances in the Irish labour market at occupational level. In the second instance, the lists are reviewed in the light of data from the Vacancy Overview Annual Report, which provides an overview of the demand for labour as measured by trends identified in advertised job vacancies.</p><p>  To enhance this targeted approach to economic migration, the Employment Permits Amendment Bill will provide more flexible and targeted instruments in support of the economy&rsquo;s evolving skill needs. The Bill will go to Government shortly for approval to publish.</p></reply>

Data from the recent Indecon Evaluation Report indicate that 61% or 240 of the finishers in County Westmeath have progressed into paid employment.  In this regard, the progression outcomes into employment from JobBridge are among the very best in Europe.</p><p>  Persons who are signing for credits but not receiving a social welfare payment are already eligible to participate in JobBridge if they have been signing for credits for 3 months (78 days) out of the last 3 months.  While on an internship interns can commence casual employment without affecting their entitlements provided that it is not with the host organisation (i.e. not with the same employer) and it does not interfere with their internship. However, those in receipt of Social Welfare payments and those signing for credits are still subject to the normal rules as regards means testing, availability for work, etc.</p><p>  As part of their contracts, water meter installation contractors are required to employ a proportion of workers from the live register, graduates and school leavers.  In this regard, it is worth highlighting that JobBridge interns are not deemed to be employees as per Section 16 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 and as such would not count towards fulfilment of this contractual requirement.</p><p>  Table 1.

While there is no specific information on these cases, data from the recent Indecon Evaluation Report indicate that overall 61% have progressed into paid employment.  In this regard, the progression outcomes into employment from JobBridge are among the very best in Europe.</p><p>  An individual may avail of a maximum of 3 JobBridge internships, however, the total cumulative time spent on the scheme cannot exceed 18 months (78 weeks). An intern will not be permitted to do more than one internship with the same company. The maximum duration of an individual internship is 9 months (39 weeks).  This extension came into effect on 7<sup>th</sup> November and full details are available on the JobBridge website .</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Indecon Report provides a number of key recommendations which are targeted at maximising progression outcomes for interns and ensuring value for money for the exchequer.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Department have already taken a </font>number of key actions in response to th<font color="#2F2F2F">ese recommendations including increasing the number of internships that a jobseeker may undertake, improving the Department&rsquo;s quality and control checks and providing even more support to interns with a significant increase in monitoring and site visits being conducted by Department officials.

I will continue to review all aspects of the scheme and changes to improve the quality of the scheme will continue to be implemented where appropriate.</font></p></reply>

All reasonable measures are taken to ensure that the parents fulfil this duty.  </p><p>  However, in cases where the parents are dead or are incapable of acting by reason of ill-health or for other reasons, section 19(6) of the Act provides for other qualified informants who may provide the required particulars.  This means that a person other than the parent or parents may act to register the birth where the parents cannot do so.</p><p>  The signature of a qualified informant is evidence only of the fact that this was the person who gave the required particulars to the registrar and as such is a matter of fact which cannot be altered.</p><p>  For Birth Certificates issued after 22nd July 2013, the box Faianeiseora B/Informant B no longer appears where only one qualified informant attends to register the birth.

The scheme is open to people who: (a) have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months; or (b) are in receipt of invalidity pension.</p><p>  The process of claiming partial capacity benefit involves the submission and consideration of comprehensive medical evidence in relation to the application by a Departmental Medical Assessor. Following on from this, where a Deciding Officer is putting a PCB claim into payment, they liaise with the customer in order to put the PCB claim into payment on a date to coincide with the start date of the customer&rsquo;s employment, which can result in longer decision times for partial capacity benefit claims in certain cases. </p><p>  The average decision time for partial capacity benefit claims is currently 10 weeks.</p></reply>

The aim of Community Employment (CE) is to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities within their communities. Community and voluntary organisations sponsor local/community projects that satisfy two essential criteria - that they respond to an identified community need, and that they provide training/development opportunities for participants.  There is no entrepreneurial fund available under CE.  The Deputy is asked to refer to the Enterprise Boards and Local Development Companies who may have a range of supports available depending on the feasibility of the proposal submitted.</p></reply>

The fuel allowance is paid to those in receipt of long-term jobseekers, one-parent family payment, disability allowance, invalidity pension and some people in receipt of the State pension.  Some 410,000 customers will receive the fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week for six months of the year (26 weeks) from October to April, at a cost of &euro;223 million.  The allowance is subject to a means test and is paid only to those who live alone or with certain exempted people.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments.  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September this year, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.</p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone.  While we are ending the telephone allowance we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence.  We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase.  </p><p>  Of course it is important to be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners as a group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 1.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also reduced from 27.1% to 9.7% over the same period.</p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm.  Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance.  I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this.  </p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines.</p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme (SMLPS) through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.</p><p>  Funding under the school meals scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner and afterschool clubs.  Responsibility for the type of food club and its operation lies with the school/organisation concerned.  Priority for funding under the scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  The school meals scheme does not differentiate between DEIS bands.</p><p>  A total of some 1,000 organisations, with 1,240 associated schools/preschools received funding under the SMLPS for the school year 2012/13, benefitting almost 147,000 pupils.  Total expenditure on this scheme in 2012 was some &euro;34 million, providing an average rate of approximately &euro;1.30 per child per day and &euro;156 per school/organisation.  Schools/organisations benefiting under the scheme operate a wide range of food club modalities and may have other sources of funding for their projects. The application process for the school year 2013/14 is underway and will be finalised shortly as schools establish their clubs.     </p><p>  During the previous school year, some 22 DEIS schools or associated organisations in County Galway received funding under the SMLPS.  There were no increased allocations provided to any school over that in the previous year as a result from changing from a breakfast club to a lunch club. </p><p>  The additional &euro;2m allocated to the school meals scheme for 2013 is being used to extend the scheme to additional DEIS schools.  Bringing new schools into the scheme is considered to be the fairest way of ensuring that as many DEIS schools and disadvantaged pupils as possible have access to some level of funding under the programme.</p></reply>

In a scheme introduced in 1991, following lengthy consultation with interested parties, mooring discs were issued to all boat owners having a recognised traditional mooring right on the lakes, subject to an overall limit on the number of discs issued. It is considered that a limit is necessary so as to balance recreational use with the conservation imperative of flora and fauna of the lakes and surrounding areas and also taking account of obligations under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. My Department does not permit the placing of boats on the lakes on a daily basis, as boats and engines coming from outside the Park carry the risk of spreading invasive alien species such as zebra mussels and various pond weeds.</p><p>  To facilitate others, applicants for mooring pegs are placed on a waiting list and any pegs becoming available are allocated to those on the list. In order to facilitate the short-term accommodation of some of those on the waiting list, they are entered into a lottery each year for one of 20 temporary mooring pegs to use the lakes for one year. </p><p>  My Department receives numerous requests for mooring spaces but, unfortunately, the demand far exceeds the number of spaces available. My Department is currently in the process of reviewing all issues relating to the ongoing management of the lakes in the Park, including all boating activities, with a view to developing a long-term sustainable strategy for the lakes as an integral part of Killarney National Park.</p><p>  The individual referred to in the Deputy's Question has contacted my Department directly in relation to this matter and my officials have informed him of the position as set out above.</p></reply>

It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, including through the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat), and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation. The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup the additional costs incurred by suppliers in sourcing a proportion of their electricity supplies from such generators. The policy and terms associated with PSO levy supported plant are mandated by Government in the relevant legislation and approved by the European Commission. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), as set out in legislation, acts in an administrative function to calculate and certify the levy. As part of its calculation and certification of the PSO levy, the CER only allows costs properly incurred under the relevant PSO contracts/schemes and ensures that the scheme is administered efficiently.   </p><p>  The cost of the levy for October 2013 to Sept 2014 as calculated by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is &euro;210.9 million, an increase of &euro;79.7 million on the 2012/2013 levy of &euro;131.2 million. For domestic customers, the PSO levy will increase from &euro;2.32 per month to &euro;3.57 per month from October 2013 and this will be reflected in their electricity bills. The reasons given by the CER for the increase in the levy are:</p><p>- A lower forecast System Marginal Price (SMP) in the Single Electricity Market (SEM). The forecast price for 2013/2014 is &euro;64.28/MWh. This is a reduction from 2012/2013 when the SMP was calculated at &euro;65.72/MWh. A lower SMP results in the need for an increased PSO to recover costs for electricity generation which is guaranteed a support price under the PSO. If those plants cannot recover their supported price through the market price the size of the PSO levy has to be increased to support them up to the level of their guaranteed prices.</p><p>- An increase in the quantity of renewable generation subject to PSO support. There is an increase of 265 MW of REFIT renewable generation capacity compared to 2012/2013.</p><p>- A greater &quot;R&quot; factor. The PSO levy is calculated each year and is based on estimates of costs to be recovered by the relevant parties if these costs cannot be recovered in the market. These figures are adjusted two years afterwards when fully audited costs have been submitted and the actual market price is known. The &quot;R&quot; factor is the name given to this adjustment. The actual payments from the market in 2011/2012 were lower than expected and the &quot;R&quot; factor for 2013/2014 retrospectively reconciles these payments.</p></reply>

It represents the most important investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations and will position our energy system for decades to come.    </p><p>  Electricity demand for business and homes must be met safely and securely 365 days a year. Our ability to rebuild the economy, to attract and retain foreign investment, to sustain Irish enterprise, to create jobs and growth, to deliver regional development and to ensure the well-being of our people depend on this.</p><p>  Grid25 will take several years to complete and it represents an investment of &euro;3.2 billion. It involves extensive work throughout the country, including building 800km of new power lines and upgrading 2,000 km of existing lines &ndash; double the size of today&rsquo;s grid. The Grid25 project will reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels by putting the infrastructure in place to enable us use our own natural resources, help us create less carbon waste and enable us reach our renewable energy targets by 2020. </p><p>  There is no requirement for wind farm developers to connect to the National Grid, but ordinarily they do so to transmit electricity to consumers. The principal supports for renewable electricity generation are the current REFIT, and former AER schemes. These schemes are funded though the Public Service obligation (PSO) levy, which is paid for by all electricity consumers.</p></reply>

Cost effective harnessing of the potential of the sector as a whole will be crucial to reducing our dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports, creating a low carbon energy system and delivering jobs in the green economy. The Government, as outlined in the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012, is confident that Ireland has the capability to achieve its 2020 national targets for renewable electricity from onshore renewable generation and primarily from wind. Accordingly, there is no support scheme for offshore wind for domestic consumption on the basis that it would impose unnecessary costs on the electricity consumer.    </p><p>  In addition to pursuing our domestic renewable electricity requirements, my Department is also working closely with the United Kingdom Government to pursue the opportunity of harnessing the abundant potential of our renewable energy resources, including offshore wind, for export.</p><p>  As set out in the 2012 Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure, the Government is keenly aware of the need to balance the requirement to deliver the new energy infrastructure necessary to ensure that the energy needs of all consumers are met in a way that is secure, reliable, sustainable and competitive, with the requirement to engage fully with the public regarding their concerns at such developments. To this end, on 23 October last, I launched the first of three phases of public consultation on the Strategic Environmental Assessment of the proposal to export renewable energy from Ireland to the UK. Responses to this consultation are sought by 22 November, 2013. </p><p>  Additionally, my Department is currently finalising an Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP). The process began with the carrying out of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). Informed by the findings of the SEA, the OREDP will identify how best to coordinate actions across the environmental, energy and economic development policy areas in order to realise Ireland&rsquo;s abundant offshore renewable energy potential in a sustainable way, using both offshore wind, and emerging ocean, technologies.</p><p>  Furthermore, with regard to the development of onshore wind, a review of the Wind Energy Planning Guidelines currently underway, is examining the manner in which the guidelines address key issues such as noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker. The review is being carried out by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with this Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, in order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets, while at the same time ensuring that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities. It is expected that draft revised guidelines will be published for consultation by the end of November with a view to the finalisation of the new guidelines by mid-2014.</p></reply>

That re-evaluation found that there remains an urgent strategic need for the project and recommended that the new interconnector would take the form of a single circuit 400kV alternating current overhead line.  The re-evaluation process had regard for the Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure, published in July 2012.  In July 2013 EirGrid published its Preferred Project Solution Report which documents EirGrid&rsquo;s design process and identifies a preferred line route and the indicative location of the towers.  An eight-week public consultation on the report was held from Tuesday, 16 July to Monday 9 September 2013.  This was the final formal consultation period prior to the submission of an application for planning approval to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The preferred project solution is a 400kV overhead power line.  The report provides detailed information on the line route, including: maps; siting; construction of towers; and an outline of the environmental issues to be addressed in an Environmental Impact Statement.</p><p>  The Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies. These are matters for the developers and for the forward planning process through regional and local development plans and at project level through the development management process.</p></reply>

The Department has a small cohort of permanent staff, some 250 full time equivalents at present.Its remit includes oversight of very complex policy areas and direct procurement of major services where protection of the State's interest must be paramount.  This situation necessarily requires my Department to procure specialist external professional advice in legal, financial and technical areas to enable it to discharge its responsibility to deliver quality services and protect the interests of the State and the taxpayer.  In obtaining these specialised services, my Department always seeks to ensure value for money and that expenditure is kept to the minimum necessary.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-12a.674.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111200068#WRP01300"><p>I met with the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) earlier this year to discuss <i>inter alia</i> measures which might be taken to protect children from some of the adverse consequences which can arise from going online, including bullying or harassment.  In this context, I should point out that Governments cannot impose an obligation on ISPs, such as that suggested by the Deputy, to filter or block online content.  Online media are not subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There are a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around &lsquo;regulating&rsquo; online<b><i></i></b>media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.</p><p>  Ireland is committed through the Internet Governance Principles contained in the Declaration of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers to the principle of &ldquo;Multi-stakeholder governance&rdquo;.  In this regard, the development of international Internet related public policies and Internet governance arrangements must allow for full and equal participation of all stakeholders from all countries.  My Department continues to be engaged in the discussions on these issues.  My Department also monitors international developments with a view to ensuring that domestic policy within its remit reflects best practice and that the regulatory framework is amended as necessary.</p><p>  The protection of children online is of paramount importance and there are a number of initiatives already in place in this respect, notably through the Department of Education&rsquo;s resources and support for parents and children as well as the various initiatives carried out by the Office for Internet Safety, established by Government to take lead responsibility for Internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  This Office operates under the aegis of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Office also aims at building linkages and cohesion between all Departments and Agencies to ensure that the State provides the best possible protection for the community and promotes Internet safety.</p><p>  The importance of education in this context cannot be overemphasised.  It is essential that children, young people and parents are educated as to the risks that can be found online and that parents and teachers are supported in explaining these issues to children.  In this regard, there are a range of tools available online to assist parents in managing internet access.  One important initiative in this regard brought forward by my Department is the development of the website called  which seeks to promote best practice in relation to many issues arising from the use of the Internet.  This campaign, which was developed with industry, provides information in relation to the use of ICT by children.  The Department has also engaged in a number of EU initiatives on this subject, including Council Conclusions on the protection of children in the digital world in 2011, and continues to play an important role in discussions in the Council of Europe.</p><p>  While my Department does not have the lead role in relation to the specific issue of cyber-bullying, it works closely with other relevant Government Departments on this issue and the use of the Internet and Information and Communication Technology generally.  Earlier this year, the Department of Education and Skills published an action plan on addressing certain cyber issues, including specific measures on cyber-bullying and in September published &lsquo;Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools&rsquo;.  I welcome these initiatives and hope that they will assist in addressing the challenges associated with cyber bullying.</p></reply>

The Antarctic Treaty System comprises the Antarctic Treaty, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (&ldquo;CCAMLR&rdquo;), the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals 1972 (&ldquo;CCAS&rdquo;) and the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection 1991 (&ldquo;the Protocol&rdquo;).  The Department of Foreign Affairs view is that preparation for signature and ratification by Ireland would impose substantial administrative burdens on several Government Departments.</p><p>  Though no formal cost benefit analysis has been undertaken on the impact of adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, the associated administrative burden would be substantial with the process not providing any significant practical benefit.  While the objectives and achievements of the ATS are of considerable importance and the commitment of the signatories is to be commended, Government Departments, including my own, have to concentrate their diminishing resources on their core business and areas of priority national interest and concern and are not in a position to assume any administrative burden associated with the ATS signature and ratification process and ensuing treaty obligations at the present time.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (trading as &ldquo;3&rdquo;), the NBS mobile wireless service currently offers minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  My Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers, who have fully utilised 3's established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved, can contact by email at .  My Department will then liaise with &ldquo;3&rdquo; personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy any service performance issues.  While my Department has previously dealt with a small number of individual complaints from NBS customers in the area referred to by the Deputy there is no evidence to suggest widespread poor quality performance in the area. Last November, a member of the Department's technical staff visited a number of premises within the area referred to by the Deputy.  The broadband speeds recorded in each of the premises at the time of the visit were within the contracted specifications of NBS service.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Galway.  This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>-  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

However , the powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) have not yet been extended to include non-ionising radiation with in their remit; this matter is under consideration in the context of the proposed merger of the RPII with the Environmental Protection Agency, scheduled for 2014.  The issue of the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields was the subject of an Expert Group Report commissioned by the Government and published in March 2007.  This Report, entitled <i>Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields</i> , is available for download on my Department&rsquo;s website ().  The Report examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced from electricity pylons.   The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion was that no adverse short - or long-term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).</p><p>  With regard to Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) fields of non-ionising radiation emitted by electricity power lines, the Report concluded that there is limited scientific evidence of adverse health effects.  The Expert Group recommended that precautionary measures be used, where appropriate, and that Ireland continue to adopt and enforce the international guidelines developed by the ICNIRP and endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Union.  A substantial volume of research on this issue is being carried out internationally by regulatory bodies with responsibilities for monitoring the health effects of electromagnetic fields.  The findings of this research are being monitored by the WHO&rsquo;s EMF Project; it is expected that a report will issue in 2014.  My Department will continue to monitor this and other scientific evidence as it is made available, and will consider any policy implications in this context.</p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.</p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014.  Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes must be managed.  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-12a.712.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013111200069#WRQ00400"><p>I again extend my deepest sympathies to the families and colleagues of Brian Murray and Mark O&rsquo;Shaughnessy whose deaths occurred in tragic circumstances in Bray in 2007.   </p><p>  The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises and equipment for use by fire service personnel is a matter for the fire authorities under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003.</p><p>  My Department, through the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, engages on an on-going basis with fire authorities on the development and implementation of national policy. I published a new national policy for the future direction of fire services in February 2013 titled <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i>   (KCS). This is intended to keep fire safety and fire services in Ireland in line with international best practice and to manage fire risk effectively so that the downward trend in the level of fire loss recorded annually continues. </p><p>  There have been a number of initiatives to assist fire authorities in meeting their statutory responsibilities while also complying with the requirements of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. These include embedding the &ldquo;safe person&rdquo; concept for those working in fire services, so that they are appropriately equipped and trained, have procedures and are supervised so that, in so far as is reasonably practicable, their safety at work is ensured. Initiatives include the introduction into fire service operations of the National Incident Command System in 2007; the template for Fire Services Ancillary Safety Statements also from 2007, Fire Service Standard Operational Guidance (SOGs) 2010 &ndash; 2013; other operational guidance including The Use of Breathing Apparatus in the Fire Service (2007) as well as associated training material. Occupational Health Systems and Critical Incident Stress Management programmes were also put in place with co-ordination and assistance from the relevant bodies at national level. Developments in this field are on-going and a Fire Services Safety Management System (SMS) is being developed to ensure that occupational health and safety in fire services is fully aligned with local government SMS policy and is based on international best practice in this field.</p><p>  Three separate investigations were carried out into the Bray fire tragedy. These were conducted by the relevant statutory authorities, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Wicklow County Council itself. For the record, Wicklow County Council pleaded guilty to four specific charges in the recent court case arising from the investigations of the Bray fire tragedy. In the course of the trial the original charges were amended and Wicklow County Council pleaded guilty to the revised charges as follows:</p><p>-  not providing a system of work which effectively ensured that sufficient assistance was available from a second fire tender within a reasonable period either by having a standing instruction (pre-determined attendance) and by failing to have an adequate plan to summon assistance from other brigades so as to ensure so far as reasonably possible that safe levels of resources were applied to fighting fires;</p><p>-  failing to establish, co-ordinate and maintain an effective system of central control and communication effective to secure timely assessment of response, communication with other brigades and co-ordination of response;</p><p>-  failing to review the safety statement relating to the work of the Bray fire brigade;</p><p>-  providing for the use of Bray fire brigade fire fighting apparatus being a compressed air foam system in circumstances where they had not received sufficient training in the use of that system.</p><p>  I understand from Wicklow County Council that changes have been made since September 2007 reflecting the national initiatives outlined above relating to the content of the above indictments.</p><p>  On 25 October 2007 the process of closing the Watch Room in Bray Fire Station was completed and its functions transferred to the Eastern Regional Control Centre (ERCC) operated by Dublin Fire Brigade. In addition a standardised list of Wicklow County Fire Service Pre-Determined Attendances (PDAs) became operational on that date.</p><p>  The Fire Service Ancillary Safety Statement has been revised and updated on a number of occasions between 2008 and 2013.  Personnel who use CAFS all receive training from externally accredited instructors.   </p><p>  I am also advised by Wicklow County Council that other improvements in Wicklow County Fire Service since September 2007 include:</p><p>- Adoption and application of the National Incident Command System including the provision of training to all personnel;   </p><p>-  Training for and implementation of national Standard Operational Guidance (SOGs);   </p><p>-  Location in Bray Fire Station of 8 drivers who are qualified to drive fire engines under blue light conditions, and 8 personnel trained to Unit 1 standard i.e. capable of taking charge of small incidents;   </p><p>-  Introduction of a formalised system of Pre-Incident Planning;   </p><p>-  Installation of exhaust extraction systems have been installed in all fire stations;   </p><p>-  An increase in headquarters staff numbers from 3 to 6.</p><p>-  Provision of a range of specialist Training for fire service personnel.</p></reply>

Where applications are received from civil society organisations, they are given full and careful consideration, taking into account, <i>inter alia</i>  , fairness to all interested observers and options available through the formal channels of admission available to non-governmental organisations. </p><p>  For example, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, there are established provisions and arrangements in place for admission of non-governmental organisations to sessions of the Convention bodies as observers. Attendance by observers representing civil society organisations should be pursued through that channel. Routine matters in relation to the provisions and requirements for nomination of civil society members by non-governmental organisations do not in general constitute exceptional circumstances that would warrant inclusion in the national delegation.</p></reply>

The overall purpose of this review is to assess the nature and level of the challenges which are currently facing the existing Producer Responsibility Agreements as well as the forthcoming challenges that are expected to arise in the management of various waste streams. The findings and recommendations from the review will form the basis for the development of robust producer responsibility initiatives that will enable Ireland to operate successfully in meeting our domestic and EU environmental obligations in the medium to long term.</p><p>  The terms of reference for the review provide that certain parts of the project would be progressed faster, and delivered once completed. In this regard, my Department has recently published the reports on Corporate Governance and the consideration of the introduction of a Packaging Levy.  These reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website ().  I expect to publish the reports on Waste Tyres and End-of-Life Vehicles in the coming weeks and the final report of the review will be published in the coming months.   </p><p>  The principal PRIs in Ireland are in the areas of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), batteries, packaging, end-of-life vehicles (ELVs), waste tyres and farm plastics. The majority of these PRI schemes have operated very successfully and have enabled Ireland to reach our domestic and EU recycling targets. They have also successfully contributed to Ireland meeting our overall environmental goals and have diverted substantial amounts of waste from landfill. </p><p>  In terms of packaging PRI s, Repak is the sole compliance scheme approved to date under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2007.  My Department currently also has one application on hand, from ERP Ireland, for approval under the Regulations.   </p><p>  Repak&rsquo;s last five-year approval expired at the end of 2011. This was initially extended for a twelve-month period to 31 December 2012 and then for two further periods of six and then three months to 30 September 2013. Repak was re-approved for a further five-year period from 25<sup></sup>September 2013. </p><p>  The application and assessment processes are set out under Articles 18 and 19 of the 2007 Regulations. </p><p>  One of the issues under examination under the PRI review is the issue of the competitive environment for compliance schemes in Ireland, and the review will examine and advise on the optimal competitive environment. As the review is also examining a variety of inter-related issues within the packaging sector , including the possibility of a packaging levy, I decided that I would await the results and final report of the PRI Review before completing the decision-making process in respect of ERP Ireland&rsquo;s application.  My Department has kept ERP Ireland fully informed on this matter and on the status of their application generally and has given similar indications to other potential applicants in other waste streams who had enquired about the application process namely that, while they could seek to apply, their applications would not be considered and determined until after the PRI review was finalised.</p></reply>

Nevertheless I have urged, and will continue to urge, local authorities in general to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address failures to comply with statutory requirements, particularly in relation to fire safety in residential developments within their functional areas. </p><p>  In the case of the Martello Estate in Balbriggan, my Department understands that Fingal County Council issued an enforcement notice under the Building Control Act 1990 and, on foot of undertakings given in the District Court, the developer has now carried out remedial works which have been certified by a competent professional who supervised the works.  It is understood that Fingal County Council is satisfied that the substance of the enforcement notice has been complied with and no further action is contemplated. </p><p>  In relation to Foxford Court in South County Dublin the position is that a detailed remedial works tender has been prepared by the developer and agreed with the Dublin City Fire Safety Officer.  A contractor has now been selected who has undertaken to carry out the works within a 10 week period and in a manner which will render the properties fully compliant with Part B (Fire Safety) of the Building Regulations.  South Dublin County Council will continue to liaise closely with the developer and the Management Company of Foxford Court and is confident that all parties concerned are committed to achieving a full and early resolution to this problem. </p></reply>

The statutory requirements are set out in twelve parts (classified as parts A to M) included under the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations 1997-2013.  Technical guidance documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each of the twelve parts in order to demonstrate how the statutory requirements may be achieved in practice.    </p><p>  Generally speaking, the performance standards set out under the building regulations can be met by a variety of traditional or innovative approaches.  The building regulations and the accompanying TGDs leave it open to each individual designer to pick the optimum solution for the particular building concerned while ensuring that the mandatory performance requirements are met. </p><p>  In relation to water sustainability, Part H &ndash; Drainage and Waste Water Disposal &ndash; of the Building Regulations was updated in 2010 and the accompanying TGD H 2010 already references water sustainability systems which are coming into increasing use (e.g. rain water recovery systems, grey water usage, etc.).  At the time my Department was aware of research, undertaken over a 24 month period which commenced in 2006, by the Dublin Institute of Technology on behalf of the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee in regard to the feasibility of rainwater harvesting systems replacing treated main water for non-potable uses.  This research concluded that there is no economic basis for the adoption of rain water harvesting by domestic consumers.  Nevertheless, my Department was of the view that referencing rainwater harvesting systems in TGD H 2010, as has been done, was appropriate given the increasing level of interest in the use of such systems and that this would ensure that such systems, where used, can be designed and constructed in a safe and responsible manner and in accordance with the best available national and international guidance. </p><p>  Part G &ndash; Hygiene &ndash; of the Building Regulations was amended in 2008 and in the interests of water efficiency dual flush toilets are now standard when toilets are being installed or replaced.</p><p>  My Department also publishes design guidance for local authorities - <i>Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities</i><i> &ndash; </i>  which emphasise environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.  The influence of this guidance extends beyond social housing provision to provide an important reference point in promoting sustainability issues generally.</p></reply>

In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant nisterial or Government policies, including current guidelines issued by my Department under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Act also provides for the inclusion of development plan objectives for the carrying out of flood risk assessment for the purposes of regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding.</p><p>  In November 2009 my Department issued Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management. These are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system. These guidelines provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly floodplains, should be avoided unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level. The guidelines were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.</p><p>  These statutory guidelines, when taken together with the legislative measures in the planning code, provide a sound basis for planning authorities to identify, assess and take appropriate steps to manage flood risk in a sustainable manner within their area. I am satisfied that the Guidelines are being implemented effectively to ensure that future development takes account of these policies and I will continue to keep them under review in this regard. I have therefore no plans to direct the Council as proposed.   </p></reply>

These figures fluctuate as households are allocated housing and new households apply for support.  </p><p>  In accordance with Section 21 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, I directed all housing authorities to prepare a summary of social housing assessments carried out in their areas at 7 May 2013. The results of this assessment, when available, will detail the number of households on waiting lists in each local authority by a range of categories and will provide an important insight into the level and type of need for social housing support across the country.</p><p>  The last summary assessment carried out, at 31 March, 2011, found that there were 98,318 households on local authority waiting lists. The full results of this assessment are available on on my Department&rsquo;s website  and the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website .   </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. </p><p>  In spite of the current challenging circumstances, almost 70% of the budget for my Department will be allocated to support social housing in 2014 with an investment of over half a billion euro on a range of programmes. Meeting social housing need within the available resources will necessitate smarter and more innovative approaches in order to maximise output.  In 2014, I will continue to focus the available resources towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors of the community.</p></reply>

The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency will provide support to the Board in the delivery of the scheme. In determining priorities for remediation works, the Board will have regard to a broad range of factors including , among other things, the severity of the damage to affected dwellings , the number of affected dwellings in an estate   and the alternative options (if any) open to the homeowners to have their dwellings remediated . In so far as it is possible the Board will attempt to group affected dwellings together for the purposes of remediation pro jects in order to achieve cost efficienci es through economies of scale.   </p><p>  The initial phase of the remediation programme will deal with approximately 1,000 dwellings which, it is estimated, are in need of repair over a two year period. The post-2015 position will be dealt with having regard to the position at that time   and developments in the interim . While it is not possible, at this time, to estimate the number of dwellings that may require remediation post-2015, the considered view is that the numbers will not be as large as previously envisaged   . </p></reply>

As indicated in the Government's contributions to the most recent of these Bills the Employment Equality Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2013 - published by Senator Bacik and others - the Government accepts in principle that amendment to the existing framework is needed.

This will remain the case when the Charities Act 2009 comes into force. Though it should be noted that charity trustees cannot be remunerated for carrying out their duties as trustees.</p><p>  The reporting requirements that will apply to charities once the Act is in force will increase transparency across the sector. Charities will be required to provide annual reports to the independent regulatory authority that is to be established under the Act. These reports will be made available to the public. In this way, members of the public will have access to greater information about how charities use their resources, including public donations.  In July, the Government approved my plans to proceed with the establishment of the new Authority and it is envisaged that it will come into operation next year.</p></reply>

This information is broken down by Garda Region and Division and not by every county. The reports for period 2004 -2011 are available on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service (www.iyjs.ie).  I expect to be able to publish the report for 2012 shortly. However, in the meantime, I have been informed by Garda Commissioner that 12,246 children were referred to the Diversion Programme in 2012. This represents a 4% reduction on the number of children referred in 2011. The following table gives a breakdown by Garda Region and Division.</p><p>  Tackling youth crime is a key priority for this Government.  The youth justice system should be considered in its entirety, from the Garda Diversion Programme to the Children Courts.  The principles of the Children Act 2001 require the various authorities to apply, incrementally, a series of &quot;filters&quot; or tests to each case where a child comes into conflict with the law. </p><p>  The first main filter is the Garda Diversion Programme, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution and the formal (supervised) caution. Children admitted to the Programme engage with a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO). JLOs receive training in restorative justice practices and mediation skills and work closely with local Community Garda&iacute;. Where appropriate, children may be referred to a Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP).  The GYDP are funded and administered by the Community Programmes Unit of the Irish Youth Justice Service. This unit makes up the Department of Justice and Equality element of IYJS which is located in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Garda Youth Diversion Projects are nationwide, community-based crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from involvement in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour. The following table shows a breakdown of the projects by Garda Region and Division. Other community based projects supported by IYJS include 5 Local Drugs Task Force Projects (four in Cork City and one in Dublin West) and 18 Young Persons Probation (YPP) Community Projects. Sixteen of the YPP Community Projects operate locally and the remaining two operate at a national level.</p><p>  The second main filter is the non-custodial sanctions available to the Courts, including dismissal under the Probation Act, unsupervised sanctions (fines, disqualification, peace bond, curfew etc.), Probation supervised sanctions (community service and other community sanctions).  Finally, as a last resort, detention may be used.  </p><p>  Other Government Departments can also support youth crime prevention through social  measures which promote the well-being of people and encourage pro-social behaviour through social, economic, health and educational measures, with a particular emphasis on children and youth, and focus on the risk and protective factors associated with crime and victimisation. While the principal motivation for many of these responses is one of welfare and equality, programmes of this nature have also been found to reduce offending by improving life opportunities and outcomes generally. For example, my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald T.D. provides funding to support the provision of quality youth provision throughout the country. This funding supports the provision of youth services and programmes to young people including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and youth-related Local Drugs Task Force Projects. </p><p><b>Table: Number of children referred to the Diversion Programme in 2012</b><table><tr><th><div>Region  </div></th><th><div>Region Total</div></th><th><div>Division</div></th><th><div> Total Number of Children referred </div></th><th><div>Number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects</div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR)</td><td><div>3910</div></td><td>DMR Eastern</td><td><div>431</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>DMR North Central</td><td><div>291</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>DMR Northern</td><td><div>1013</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>DMR.

His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and this decision was upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 July 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  </p><p>  On 31 July 2008, the person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 5 March 2012.  His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Following consideration of the information submitted, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of him on 9 March 2012.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p><p>  Queries in relation in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited. </p></reply>

Only a small number of prisoners in Shelton Abbey Open Centre have the permission of the governor to be in possession of mobile phones, in keeping with its minimum security status. Further, only prisoners on Enhanced Regime are permitted this facility which is subject to close monitoring and a written agreement from the relevant prisoners regarding permissible use.</p><p>  Given advances in mobile telecommunications technology, mobile phones are becoming increasingly small in size, which provides the Irish Prison Service with particular challenges in seeking to (i) prevent their entry into prisons and (ii) locate them when smuggled inside. Specialist staff, however, are employed by the Irish Prison Service to combat this problem to the greatest extent possible. Due to improvements in security within our Prisons the number of mobile phones being seized in the previous 3 years has reduced from 1,718 seizures in 2010 to 1,368 in 2011 to 1,150 in 2012.

The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having considered the judgement in that case, I am bringing proposals to Government to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act. Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill. The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.   Subject to the approval of the Government, I expect to be in a position to have the 2012 Act and the Spent Convictions Bill amended in the next few months.  I expect to be in a position to commence the provisions of the 2012 Act in 2014.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>In the meantime, the vetting of persons working with children and vulnerable persons will continue to be done on a non-mandatory basis.</p><p>  Section 32 of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 provides that the Minister may, after consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Public Service, make regulations to prescribe fees in relation to the provision of vetting services. The question of making any such regulations will not arise until such time as the Act is commenced. Any proposals to prescribe fees will likely require some consideration of waiver of fees for certain categories of vetting applicants. Currently there are no fee charges for vetting services.</p><p>  The definition of relevant work in Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the Act requires vetting of persons engaged in work or activity as a minister or priest or any other person engaged in the advancement of any religious beliefs where the work involves &ldquo;relevant work or activities relating to children&rdquo; or &ldquo;relating to vulnerable persons&rdquo;.  I believe that this is the correct approach. Any of the professions listed in the schedules to the Act only require vetting in respect of work related to children or vulnerable persons. Priests or religious persons should be treated no differently in this regard than any other person or profession. For example, teachers working in schools require vetting, whereas teachers working in adult education or in Universities do not require vetting under the Act. The purpose of the Act is to protect children and vulnerable persons and the procedures within the Act must be confined within the scope of the Act.</p></reply>

At this stage, arising from the additional &euro;5m being made available between October and December, the Garda authorities have arranged for the delivery of 305 new vehicles by the end of 2013.

If the Deputy wishes to provide details of the individuals concerned including their names and dates of birth, I will have the matter examined further.  More generally, the Deputy may wish to note that the number of vetting applications received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) each year has risen from 187,864 in 2007 to 327,903 in 2012 and it is expected that there will be upwards of 350,000 applications this year. </p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 7-9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nonetheless, this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. This improvement reflects the fact that I have given this matter particular priority as it is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.</p><p>  In that context,  I have been actively engaged on this issue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 136 whole time equivalent staff assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170, more than double that of the average allocation of 78 staff at the Unit over the past two and a half years.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place during late 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

It broadly describes a range of non-violent crimes that people in positions of responsibility and trust commit for their own personal gain. It can cover fraud, embezzlement, insider trading on the stock market, bribery, corruption and regulatory offences in specialist fields such as financial activity, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, and food safety.  My Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption.  Other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments.</p><p>  The term &ldquo;offence&rdquo; is generally understood in Irish law to refer to criminal offences which attract penal sanctions.  While some regulatory type legislation provides for non-penal consequences for non-compliance with statutory requirements - for example, withdrawal of an operating licence or permit where statutory obligations are not fulfilled - the focus of legislation in my Department&rsquo;s area of responsibility is on criminal offences subject to trial before the courts and the imposition of penal sanctions.</p><p>  There is extensive legislation on the statute book addressing white collar and corporate crime and amendments to this legislation are also considered in the light of the experience of law enforcement agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in operating the legislation and in light of relevant court rulings.  Where there is an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions in the law, I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals.  I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that, if he feels there are other measures which might be taken in this area, I will give them very positive consideration.</p><p>  I would draw the Deputy's particular attention to the Criminal Justice Act 2011, as a recent example of such developments in white collar crime legislation, and one which represents an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in current and future investigations of white collar crime.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences (&ldquo;relevant offences&rdquo;) attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. The Act will provide vital assistance to the Garda&iacute; in the completion of current investigations as well as providing assistance to them in investigations undertaken in the future.</p><p>  Another recent provision of relevance to white collar crime is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions, which give effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Jury Service, are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial. While the breadth and diversity of the issues faced in addressing serious, organised and white collar crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address it in all its facets, the overall body of legislation in place is comprehensive and, as I have outlined, is continuously under review and development in light of operational experience and other relevant considerations.</p><p>  In regard to the sanctions which can be imposed on persons found guilty of white collar offences it would be unduly onerous to list every possible offence and penalty and so I will note just some of the key provisions.</p><p>Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001</p><p>Section 4  of the 2001 Act incriminates the dishonest appropriation of property.  Section 10 incriminates false accounting,  section 11 incriminates the suppression of documents with the intention of making a gain causing a loss, section 25 provides for the offence of forgery, and section 26 incriminates using a false instrument.  All these offences carry a maximum ten year sentence of imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.  Section 59 requires auditors to report a range of offences under the Act.  Failure to do so is itself an offence.</p><p>Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010</p><p>The main offences of offering or accepting bribes under the Acts carry a maximum ten year sentence of imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.</p><p>The 1889 to 2010 Acts will be replaced by the forthcoming Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill.  The Bill will:</p><p>- replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in the old legislation</p><p>- address the bribery of foreign public officials</p><p>- provide for the liability of corporate bodies for the corrupt actions of their directors, employees and agents</p><p>- include discrete offences outlawing trading in influence</p><p>- take account of the Mahon Tribunal recommendations to criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends to use them as bribes.</p><p>The Bill is also intended to enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments such as:</p><p>- where an interested party makes a payment to a public official;</p><p>- where a public official has a lifestyle or property out of proportion to their official income and declared interests; and</p><p>- where an official accepts a gift in breach of ethical or disciplinary codes.</p><p>Penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines are envisaged for persons convicted on indictment.  It is also intended to allow a judge to order a public official convicted of an offence to forfeit their office and exclude them from seeking public office for a period of years.  These forfeiture provisions will apply to all elected and senior office holders as well as a wide range of civil and public servants.</p><p>Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 </p><p>The 2010 Act provides a maximum sentence of 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine for laundering the proceeds of crime.  The Act also provides a wide range of measure for the prevention and reporting of laundering by banks, accountants and other designated persons</p></reply>

It would be intolerable to hinder access to or usage of the web for such purposes. However, it is also widely accepted that there is a duty to protect vulnerable persons, especially children, from exposure to damaging content or the misuse of the opportunities for easy communication offered by the web.</p><p>  We must also unfortunately recognise that the internet's  global reach can make the taking of action against offending or offensive websites almost impossible.</p><p>  National authorities here and elsewhere are taking actions that recognise the balance to be struck between these considerations. Their efforts are directed at counteracting misuse of the internet. </p><p>  The Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online, an EU - US initiative launched during the recent Irish Presidency, is a fine example of international cooperation. That initiative is attracting very wide support, well beyond the original signatories.  </p><p>  At national level, my Department, through the Office for Internet Safety, supports a variety of information programmes. The Office makes information available on its website (and on linked sites)  as well as through its publications, including one on cyberbullying.  </p><p>  'Filtering' is an approach many parents find helpful in protecting their children from online abuse. The Office also has a very helpful booklet on the topic. I encourage families to contact their service provider, most of whom have filtering available as part of the service.  </p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills has undertaken an extensive awareness raising programme on bullying, including cyberbullying, for use in schools.</p><p>  While I feel most cases of cyberbullying can be dealt with at the level of the school or the workplace, with the active support of, in particular, parents, I know that in a few cases it may be necessary to invoke the criminal law, but the criminal law can be employed only when victims come forward and assist the Garda&iacute; in building a case against their tormentors.  </p><p>  I recognise that it will be very difficult to eradicate cyberbullying.

As such they demand rigorous procedures to ensure their integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of them.</p><p>  To achieve these aims, a vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request. Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012 and expects to receive in the region of 350,000 applications by the end of 2013. </p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 7-9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nonetheless, this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. This improvement reflects the fact that I have given this matter particular priority as it is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.</p><p>  In that context,  I have been actively engaged on this issue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 136 whole time equivalent staff assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170, more than double that of the average allocation of 78 staff at the Unit over the past two and a half years.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place during late 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

I am advised that currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet, <i>A Guide to the Noise Regulations</i>, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website .</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy personnel to establish a highly visible and accessible service to communities to tackle crime, the fear of crime and anti-social behaviour. In this regard anyone who feels that they are subject to criminal or anti-social behaviour should report the matter to their local Garda station. </p><p>  Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January 2007. Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court. With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.</p><p>  The Act provides that a person behaves in an anti-social manner if the person causes or, in the circumstances, is<b></b>likely to cause, to one or more persons who are not of the same household as the<b></b>  person harassment, significant or persistent alarm, distress, fear or intimidation or significant or persistent impairment of their use or enjoyment of their property.</p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Act, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the management of such areas.</p><p>  Section 2(2) provides that provisions set out in Schedule 2 of the Act will apply to multi-unit developments consisting of houses, whether detached, semi-detached or terraced, but which have an OMC structure.  The relevant sections of the Act which apply to such developments are:</p><p><i>Section 4 </i>&mdash; Transfer of common areas in cases where <i>section 3</i>  does not apply.</p><p><i>Section 5 </i>  &mdash; Obligation of developer to transfer ownership of common areas of completed developments  to owners&rsquo; management company.</p><p><i>Section 6 </i>  &mdash; Owners&rsquo; management company to join in transfer to purchasers.</p><p><i>Section 7 </i>  &mdash; Obligations to complete development to remain with developer.</p><p><i>Section 8 </i>  &mdash; Automatic transfer of membership of owners&rsquo; management company on sale of unit.</p><p><i>Section 9 </i>  &mdash; Consequences of transfer of common areas.</p><p><i>Section 11 </i>  &mdash; Determination of certain beneficial interests on completion of development.</p><p><i>Section 12 </i>  &mdash; Determination of certain beneficial interests in common areas in certain cases.</p><p><i>Section 17 </i>  &mdash; Annual meetings and reports of owners&rsquo; management companies) &mdash; other than &mdash;</p><p>(<i>a</i>) <i>section 17(2)(c) </i>  (unless a sinking fund exists in respect of the development),</p><p>(<i>b</i>) <i>section 17(2)(g) </i>  (to the extent that provision related to the relevant part of the development), and</p><p>(<i>c</i>) <i>section 17(2)(h)</i> .</p><p><i>Section 18 </i>  &mdash; Annual service charges.</p><p><i>Section 20 </i>&mdash; Application of <i>section 19 </i>  to certain developments.</p><p><i>Section 21 </i>  &mdash; Owners&rsquo; management company annual charges.</p><p><i>Section 22 </i>  &mdash; (Recovery of charges and contributions).</p><p><i>Section 24 </i>&mdash; Dispute resolution and rehabilitation of multi-unit developments (other than s<i>ubsections  (5)(b)</i>and <i>(5)(h) </i>  of that section).</p><p><i>Section 25 </i>&mdash; Persons who may apply under   <i>section 24.</i></p><p><i>Section 26 </i>  &mdash; Jurisdiction and venue of Circuit Court.</p><p><i>Section 27 </i>  &mdash; Mediation conferences.</p><p><i>Section 28 </i>  &mdash; Report of chairperson of mediation conference.</p><p><i>Section 29 </i>  &mdash; Saver for existing jurisdictions.</p><p><i>Section 30 </i>  &mdash; Restoration of certain companies to register.</p><p><i>Section 31 </i>  &mdash; Transfer of benefit of guarantees and warranties.</p><p><i>Section 32 </i>  &mdash; Restriction on entering into certain contracts.</p><p><i>Section 33 </i>  &mdash; Exercise of power to make regulations.</p><p><i>Schedule 3 </i>&mdash; Documentation to be handed over pursuant to   <i>section 31(2)</i></p><p>  Section 2(2) of the Act was put in place in order to accommodate developments consisting of houses which have an OMC structure in accordance with the planning conditions.

I should add that the taking-in-charge of such housing developments is a matter for the relevant local authority and I am aware that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has issued a guidance document to the local authorities on this matter.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

The prisoner returned voluntarily to the prison at a later date and was not granted a further period of temporary release, i.e. they were taken back into custody.</p><p>  In 2012, a life sentenced prisoner was not granted a further period of temporary release when he reported to the prison primarily because of his non cooperation with Probation Service supervision and due to the fact that he was not of good behaviour when he was convicted of a minor offence . The legality of his detention was later challenged in an Article 40 Habeus Corpus case in the High court. He was subsequently granted a short period of temporary release with specific conditions which he failed to comply with and was taken back into custody. </p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that life sentenced prisoners who are released into the community continue to serve their sentences, subject to a number of stringent conditions.  While in the community, a life sentenced prisoner will be on Reviewable Temporary Release under the supervision of the Probation Service.  Reviewable Temporary Release is where a prisoner is granted a specific period of temporary release from prison.  This can be at varying intervals, for example, weekly, monthly or annually.   The period of release is reviewed when the prisoner returns to prison and a decision is made whether to refuse or grant a further period of Reviewable Temporary Release.</p><p>  The Probation Service provide Progress Reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a Life Sentenced prisoner may present.  Where it is reported to the Irish Prison Service that the prisoner in the community is failing to abide by the conditions of their release, that person may be refused a further period of temporary release and be taken back into custody.  </p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may return a prisoner to prison where they are of the view that the prisoner is in breach of their temporary release conditions.  When this happens, the Governor will conduct an oral hearing into the allegation.  If the Governor is satisfied, taking into account evidence presented and comments made, that a breach of temporary release conditions has occurred the prisoner should be notified accordingly.  The Reviewable Temporary Release is then revoked and the prisoner is taken back into custody.</p></reply>

This review concluded that, arising from the substantial reduction in disease levels and the changes introduced earlier this year in relation to the implementation of controls in the context of the TB eradication programme, the number of administrative staff required in the local offices would be significantly reduced and that further significant efficiencies in terms of the number of administrative staff required would accrue from the centralisation of administrative support in one or more centralised office(s).  I have accepted this recommendation and I have decided that the centralised offices will be based in Cavan and Portlaoise. </p><p>  The position in relation to Drumshanbo is that some administrative staff are currently engaged in work for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade while the remainder continue to provide the administrative function from that office for my Department.  Should the opportunity arise to redeploy administrative staff from the Drumshanbo office then this will be considered. As with other local offices where redeployment has taken place, a full frontline service will be maintained and the service provided to farmers will not diminish in any way.</p></reply>

These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes.  With improving technology and in the interests of efficient use of limited recourses, and also in accordance with the governing EU legislation, the emphasis under the eligibility inspection programme has been to move towards the increased use of 'Remote Sensing', based on satellite imagery.  In many cases this removes the need for an on farm visit by Department officials.</p><p>In the current year, of the overall 7,500 eligibility inspections scheduled, some 75% are being done by means of Remote Sensing.  Remote Sensing inspections may give rise to follow-up ground inspections, where it has not been possible to determine definitively the eligibility of certain land features (e.g. scrub).  In these cases the results obtained are used, in combination with the clear satellite imagery, to finalise the eligibility inspection of the entire areas declared.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>It is also standard procedure, that, a Ground Inspection is carried out by my Department to verify the outcome of the Remote Sensing inspections which result in the application of a penalty.</p><p>  My Department, in accordance with EU rules, determines the SPS applications selected each year for eligibility inspections including the areas of the Country where satellite imagery will be used.<i><font color="#004080"> </font></i>The satellite imagery used for Remote Sensing inspections is supplied to my Department by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre.  It is subsequently examined, in accordance with the governing rules, by a specialist service provider contracted for this purpose by my Department.  I am satisfied that the Remote Sensing inspection regime described above is as required by the EU and is implemented in a fair and balanced manner by officials in my Department.</p><p>  As regards the clearing of maps received by my Department, I would point out that in early 2013 my Department circulated maps to all applicants under the 2013 SPS asking that these be examined and updated as necessary.  Many farmers returned amended maps to my Department as part of their SPS application process to facilitate re-digitising, in order to have various ineligible features, such as buildings, roadways, farmyards, etc, properly recorded on the LPIS.  The necessary amendments are made, on an ongoing basis, to accurately reflect the position on the ground. </p><p>  I do not accept that there is any delay in completing the work required to successfully update and clear these cases.  It must be remembered that under EU rules, the earliest permissible date for payment under the Single Payment Scheme is actually the 1st of December.  This year I made a special case to the European Commission securing agreement to make an advance payment of 50% from 16<sup>th</sup> October.  Since payments under the Single Payment Scheme started on 16 October, &euro;582 million has issued to over 115,000 farmers.  This equates to some 93% of all eligible applicants. In addition, payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commenced, on target, on 22 September and, to date, payments worth over &euro;178 million have issued to over 84,000 farmers.</p><p>  It is not possible under legislation governing the payment of aid under the area based schemes to make payment in cases that are not fully processed and clear.  I have prioritised the resolution of outstanding cases and can also confirm that arrangements are well advanced to allow balancing payments under the Single Payment Scheme commence issuing on target, as and from 1 December. </p></reply>

The administrative functions have already been transferred out of a number of regional offices (notably, Ennis, Clonakilty, Limerick and Tipperary), without any negative implications for the provision of services to farmer clients.  The transfer of the administrative functions out of other regional offices will be considered in light of the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services. </p><p>  I would like to emphasise that the Department vets, inspectors and technical officers, along with appropriate administrative support, will remain in place at the Regional Offices to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from these offices.  In view of this, I can assure the Deputy that frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Department's stakeholders will continue to be available at these regional offices, including those located in the West of Ireland. </p></reply>

These mandatory inspections are governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.</p><p>  These inspections are a necessary requirement to drawn down approximately &euro;1.7 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances.  My Department must therefore ensure that these inspections are conducted in full accordance with the legislative provisions. </p><p>  EU regulations governing these inspections prescribe a range of reductions and penalties to be applied where an over-declaration in area has been found at an Eligibility inspection and/or where non-compliance under the Cross Compliance regime has been identified at inspection.</p><p>  In the case of Eligibility inspections, a tiered rate of reduction applies:</p><p>  -  Difference of less than 3% or 2 ha - Aid reduced to reflect lower eligible area;</p><p>  -  Difference &amp;gt;3%, but &amp;lt; 20% - Aid based on lower eligible area reduced by twice the difference between the area determined and the area claimed (or entitlements held if lower);</p><p>  -  Difference &amp;gt; 20%, but &amp;lt; 50 % - No payment for Scheme year;</p><p>  -  Difference &amp;gt; 50% - No payment for Scheme year and a Multi-Annual sanction based on the value of the Single Farm Payment on the area over-declared, to be offset against any payments in the following 3 calendar years.</p><p>  In the case of Cross Compliance inspections, where the non-compliance is due to negligence the penalty is 3%, which can be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance.  Where the non-compliance is determined as intentional, the standard reduction is 20%, but this can be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on the extent, severity and permanence.  Where non-compliance is deemed to be minor in nature, tolerance may be applied with the applicant advised to remedy the problem.

My Department under the legislation is obliged to ensure the accurate disbursement of all community funds. It conducts this through a robust inspection system.  An ongoing EU audit system is in place which includes the Certifying Body, the Commission and the Court of Auditors to ensure the veracity of all payments.  All staff are regularly trained on how to conduct these inspections.  This training is based on the implementing legislation, audit findings and the latest clarifications from the Commission.  </p><p>  All applicants for SPS payments are further protected by the comprehensive appeal process in place.  An applicant who may consider that an inspection has not been properly conducted may appeal.  This appeal process includes a number of possible steps to ensure fairness.  An applicant may appeal to the local district supervisor in the first instance.  Should he not be satisfied he can then appeal to the independent appeals office.  Failing this he can appeal to the ombudsman&rsquo;s office or take the matter to the courts. </p><p>  The meeting on the 6<sup>th</sup> of July 2011 was a normal internal meeting of staff following on from a file checking review and did not include any reference to the applicant in question.  A letter dated 13th December 2011 issued to the person named outlining the outcome of this inspection.  If the person named wishes to seek a review of any aspect of the inspection, as mentioned above, he should do so to the local district supervisor in the first instance clearly outlining the grounds of his appeal.</p></reply>

My Department does not maintain records specifically on the presence of scrub and rushes.</p><p>  As part of the controls laid down by the Commission and in order to avoid substantial disallowance of EU funds my Department is currently reviewing all land parcels claimed.

This is a mammoth task but my Department is making every effort to ensure that it will be completed in a manner that satisfies the Commission.  As a result of this phase of this review, any payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible including scrub, must be reimbursed. The Review of the 950,000 parcels contained on the LPIS database is well advanced at this stage and is on target to be finalised in time to allow a comprehensive response to the Commission within the specified time-frame of 15 December.

Generally, the Single Payment Scheme is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during all or any of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid payments in one or more of those years and by whom Single Payment entitlements were, therefore, established. Other farmers, including new entrants to farming since the reference period, are also eligible for the Single Payment Scheme where they have received entitlements from the National Reserve, or by way of a transfer i.e. purchase or lease.</p></reply>

However, earlier this year I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made as and from 16<sup>th</sup>  October, my approach to the Commissioner having being prompted by the protracted unseasonable weather which prevailed throughout the country, which culminated in the serious national fodder shortage and led to severe financial and animal welfare difficulties for farmers. The 50% advance payments commenced, on target, on 16 October and, to date, payments worth &euro;582 million have issued to over 115,000 farmers. Payments continue to issue on a twice-weekly basis, as individual cases are confirmed eligible for payment. Table 1, below, sets out the Single Farm payments made, to date, on a county basis.</p><p>  Payments under the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme begin issuing, on target, on 25 September. While there is no regulatory date by which DAS payments must commence, it is generally recognised and indeed acknowledged in the Farmers&rsquo; Charter, that the third week in September of any given year is the earliest feasible payment date, given the volume and complexity of processing involved. To date, payments worth &euro;178 million have issued to over 84,000 farmers. Payments continue to issue on a twice weekly basis, with individual cases being paid 100% of the amount due as they are confirmed eligible. </p><p>  It should be appreciated, however, that many applicants, who declare land situated in a Disadvantaged Area are not eligible for payment under the Scheme. Many of these applicants do not maintain any animals and those that do maintain animals do not keep sufficient livestock to meet the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare. This is a normal feature of the Disadvantaged Area Scheme. I should emphasise, however, that many of those currently showing as having insufficient stock will ultimately satisfy the requirement &ndash; the minimum retention period being seven consecutive months. I expect that there will be a steady flow of cases each month where compliance with this retention period will be confirmed, thereby allowing payments to issue.

A number of sub-contractors have also been appointed and construction started on site on 23 September 2013.  On 14 October 2013 I officially launched the construction of the new facilities. </p><p>  The timeline for the project will see the first three new residential units available in the third quarter of 2014, which will be used to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities (currently St. Patrick's Institution) to the Oberstown campus and will deliver on the Government's commitment to end the practice of detaining children in St. Patrick's Institution.  An additional three residential units, to be delivered in 2015, will be used to replace existing accommodation on the Oberstown campus which has reached the end of its useful life.  The development will also provide associated education, recreation, security and other ancillary facilities and will result in all detention services for children being delivered in a single location, maximising the scope for ensuring best practice standards, using the children detention school model, and operational efficiency.  The project is due to be fully complete by the third quarter of 2015.  </p><p>  Among the facilities to be provided is a dedicated medical area to support improved delivery of on-site services from visiting doctors and dentists and from the nurse employed on campus.  In addition, and in advance of the new facilities being delivered, a certified system of mental health screening is shortly to be implemented for all young people being detained on campus which will identify those who are misusing drugs/alcohol within 24 to 48 hours after admission.  These young people  will be referred to the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS), a new HSE service based on the Oberstown campus that will provide in-reach therapeutic services to the children detention schools.  This service includes addiction counsellors.   </p><p>  However, the deputy should be aware that the children detention schools are not specialist drug treatment centres.  A policy for Drugs/Alcohol and Substance Use/Misuse has been developed to deal appropriately with young people affected by these issues including access to specialist services when necessary.  The policy is available to view on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service, www.iyjs.ie.  This approach is in line with the wider approach of facilitating access by young people to appropriate specialist interventions whereby those with specialist needs are accompanied to healthcare and other settings.</p><p>  Staff in the children detention schools are, and will continue to be, fully supported with training and development in this and all other relevant areas to ensure competency in working in what is often a very challenging environment. Measures are ongoing to create an integrated, single campus and to develop a single set of care policies, in the context of the proposed full amalgamation of the existing 3 children detention schools, which will support management and staff in cross campus working and opportunities for further development.  A Campus Manager is to be appointed shortly who will be responsible for driving the reforms that are currently taking place in Oberstown.    In order to complement the expansion in the Oberstown campus, work is ongoing on a recruitment programme to be implemented on a phased basis for additional care staff needed to manage the new facilities that are being brought into operation during 2014. </p><p>  A comprehensive planning process has also recently commenced for the delivery of services for all children under 18 in Oberstown in advance of the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys.  This will include appropriate input from the Irish Youth Justice Service which is based in my Department, the Irish Prison Service and other agencies including the Probation Service, the Courts Service, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE Child and Family Support Services, which will shortly become the Child and Family Agency. </p></reply>

The desire to know one's identity, or to re-establish contact with a child,  is very fundamental and entirely reasonable. Existing procedures in this area, both legislative and administrative, are not ideal and I have been anxious to see improvement in this regard. The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the HSE implement improved and consistent arrangements. It is also necessary to acknowledge that the legal and Constitutional framework within which such access operates is complex, reflecting as it does the balancing rights to privacy of the mother or a child who may not wish for contact to be re- established or personal information exchanged.  </p><p>  Work is continuing  in relation to the preparation of the Heads of Bill of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of bill before Government at the earliest possible date. The Constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. I have agreed with the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee that once agreed by Government, the Heads of Bill  will be the subject of Committee hearings so that the complex and sensitive issues involved can be the subject of public consideration.</p></reply>

Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the prospects it holds for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. My Department works closely with the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and others as part of a cross-departmental effort  to realise Government objectives for employment growth and improved access to the labour market for young unemployed people.</p><p>  In 2013, funding of  &euro;53.498m, including &euro;1.75m  for a new capital funding programme, has been provided to my Department for the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of these services at local level and each year over 380,000 young people participate in a range of activities and programmes designed to enhance their learning and self development.</p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, my aim is to promote the potential youth work can play, as part of the response to the challenges facing young people today including the youth employment challenge, through collaboration with other interests. Youth work and non-formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development, offer young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience,  motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21st century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&rsquo;s world including training and career readiness.</p><p>  There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance young people&rsquo;s development including their employability and the programmes funded by my Department are supporting these youth work services at local, regional and national level.  A range of innovative programmes have been introduced by youth sector organisations to respond to young people's needs. These include mentoring and guidance programmes, entrepreneurship projects, volunteering and social enterprise and mobility initiatives to enhance young people&rsquo;s experiences and their employment readiness.   County level information about such initiatives in the youth sector is not readily available to my Department.</p><p>  As I have said, my Department is working closely with the Departments of Education, Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify in what ways the youth sector can contribute to the shared policy objectives for youth employment.  In particular, my Department is examining the potential of non-formal learning to reach out to those young people not in education, training or employment and to support measures implementing the Youth Guarantee. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of voluntary youth work organisations, is also considering issues to do with progressing this important agenda for our young people.</p></reply>

Due to budgetary constraints, no new projects have been admitted to these schemes since 2008.</p><p>  The allocations for the national youth organisations and for local projects and services are determined, in the first instance, by my Department having regard to the available budget under the schemes. The process for the local youth projects throughout the country  involves the submission of an annual/ renewal application for funding and an annual progress report in which the project details the target cohort of young people for their services, the programmes that are provided, their objectives and the overall number of young people that have participated in services. The local Education and Training Board (ETB) youth officer, where appropriate, has a role in recommending the relevant project for continued funding.  The process that support projects for marginalised and disadvantaged young people has not, since the inception of the schemes, had reference to county level data on demographic trends in the youth population. </p><p>  The funding for the 477 local youth projects is administered on behalf of my Department by, in the main, by the ETBs.  Pobal administers the funding for the 31 national youth organisations.  The allocations for local projects which are initially determined by my Department, are notified to the relevant ETB at the beginning of the year. In recent years, my Department has afforded the ETBs the flexibility to reconfigure the allocations to the youth projects in their area, within and across the funding schemes, where this is appropriate to their local needs and provided they remain within their overall budget. Any proposals for amalgamations/reconfiguration of the allocations to individual projects are subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval. </p><p>  The funding for the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, however, under which 1,600 local youth clubs (with 10,000 participants) benefit each year, is allocated by my Department to the Education and Training Boards on the basis of youth population numbers.</p><p>  My Department has commenced a comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of the youth funding schemes.  This review is considering the rationale and objectives of the current youth funding schemes and, inter alia, to what extent the schemes have been effective in achieving these objectives and their compatibility with the overall strategy of my Department.  It is anticipated that the review, which is nearing completion, will make recommendations for the future operation of the schemes. It is also expected to inform the youth strategy which is being developed by my Department. The youth strategy will promote co-ordination between Government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have certain functions and responsibilities for the Ombudsman for Children's Office under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. Most notably the funding of the Ombudsman for Children's Office through the Vote of my Department. </p><p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published its Public Sector Reform Document on 17th November, 2011.  This Public Service Reform Plan included an intention to address a wide range of issues, one of which is the implementation of shared service models for HR, payroll, pensions etc.  Appendix IIa of this document lists the bodies to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished.  The document references my Department relating to the Ombudsman for Children and the intention to merge the back-office functions of the Ombudsman for Children  into the Ombudsman/Information Commissioner's Office (Action No 47). </p><p>  Given the current economic climate, I am conscious that we make every effort to rationalise transactional or support processes by establishing shared operations to drive greater efficiencies and process improvement. </p><p>  In 2012, at the request of my Department, Ms. Emily Logan, the Ombudsman for Children, undertook a review of the potential for merging the back office functions of her Office into the Ombudsman/Information Commissioner's Office. This review included finance, human resources, information technology , office accommodation, equipment and supplies. The office currently has contracts in place for the provision of legal and also financial services such as payroll.  The IT function for the office is managed on a shared service basis by the Department of Health. Limited potential was identified for sharing or merging back office functions and no potential savings were identified in that process.</p><p>  More recently, in the context of wider developments in shared services, arrangements are being considered to bring HR processes for the Ombudsman for Children's Office into the civil service human resource management service known as 'People Point' in the same way as has already been done for staff of the Office of the Ombudsman/Information Commissioner.  This shared service model is part of recent public sector reform initiatives announced by Government in 2011 to bring about an integrated and efficient public sector. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the processes outlined shows the Ombudsman for Children to be taking full account of the objective of efficiency in back office and corporate supports and expenditures while continuing to discharge the very important statutory responsibilities set out in the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.</p></reply>

If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, then the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. In the performance of this function, the HSE must &quot;take such steps as it considers requisite to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children; having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise - (i) regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, and (ii) in so far as is practicable, give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child;  have regard tot he principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family&quot;.</p><p>  Once a child is in State care there are secondary legislation  instruments and National Standards to protect their rights and guide with greater precision how that is to be achieved, for example:</p><p>- The system of protection that HSE may offer is highly codified in law and covers a range of family support through to care arrangements and also provides for both voluntary arrangements, entered into by parents and guardians, as well as court-ordered arrangements for the alternative care. These latter arrangements are determined by the court authorities having regard to the various rights of both children and parents set out in the Constitution.Specifically, as regards the views of the child, Section 26 of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the appointment of a Guardian <i>Ad Litem</i>   (GAL) in respect of child care proceedings where a child is not party to those proceedings and where the court is satisfied that it is in the child&rsquo;s best interests to have a GAL appointed. A GAL is appointed at the discretion of the Court and all fees, including legal fees, are paid by the HSE. Their primary function is to provide a voice for the child in Court where the child is not party to the care proceedings. They promote the child&rsquo;s best interests to the Court.</p><p>- A child protection social worker assigned to a child placed in a care setting has a duty to prepare and regularly review the care plan for the child. Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the wishes of the child and his or her family are considered, that access and contact is facilitated between the child, parents and siblings (unless there is a court agreed reason not to do so), and that full engagement takes place with the child and their family with a view to planning the child&rsquo;s return home. A significant amount of work takes place between social workers and parents to create a situation where a child could return home, including referrals for parent(s) for relationship counselling, substance misuse or mental health issues.</p><p>- The National Standards for Foster Care 2003 state that &ldquo;children and young people in foster care are encouraged and facilitated to maintain and develop family relationship and friendships&rdquo;. They also state &ldquo;the families of children in foster care are involved in their care, in partnership with social workers and foster carers unless this is detrimental to the well being of the children, in which case the reasons for excluding them are recorded on the case files&rdquo;.</p><p>- The National Standards for Residential Care state that&rdquo; visits from family members, significant others and friends are encouraged and facilitated in private&rdquo;. They go on to state  &ldquo;where young person has lost contact with a parent , family or significant others the supervising social worker and staff members actively seek to re establish contact and to identify key people within the extended family to provide support&rdquo;.</p><p>- Access and contact by relatives to a child in care is based on the needs of the child. In most cases access to family is actively promoted and encouraged unless the access is posing a risk to the child or is causing the child distress. A child's view with regard to access is also sought where age appropriate and this view is to be respected.</p><p>  In addition to the role of the courts, there are further measures to monitor the application of standards. Currently HIQA inspects HSE children&rsquo;s residential care and child protection services and  all foster care service under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Health Act, 2007, and reports on findings to the Minister. HIQA publishes inspection reports on its website. The HSE inspect and register children&rsquo;s residential centres run by the private and voluntary sectors. All inspections are undertaken against National Standards developed by the Department of Health prior to HIQA&rsquo;s establishment. This process has revised and will continue to raise specific local quality improvement changes but will also contribute to corporate learning regarding the provision of these services. </p><p>  Other important initiatives to inform our understanding include, for example, publication of the interim report of the Child Care Law Reporting Project (CCLRP). This is a project which I have supported since its inception, and made the relevant regulations to allow the attendance of the project personnel in the courts.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is one of the co-funders of the project, along with Atlantic Philanthropies and One Foundation.</p><p>  The report is a crucial first step in improving the transparency of the conduct of child care proceedings, and informing the public and policy makers of how children are protected through the operation of the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991.  While this is an interim report, there is a significant amount of valuable information contained in the report which can be used to inform policy making on an on-going basis.</p><p>  The CCLRP will provide invaluable information about the operation of the Child Care Act, which is the mechanism used by the HSE, in exceptional circumstances, and with the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration, to make applications to court to take children into care.  These are very serious decisions, with long term impacts on the child and the family and the more information that is available about the process, while protecting the identity of vulnerable children and families, the better we can ensure the welfare and protection of children.</p></reply>

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours.</font></p><p>  At present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service (CIS), and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS). The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years. The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Garda&iacute;, hospital and ambulance service personnel. </p><p>  The Emergency Place of Safety Service operates outside the greater Dublin area,  whereby Garda&iacute; can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours. This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case. As part of this service Garda&iacute; have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis. The service is designed to ensure that children presenting as 'at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety, a foster care placement, thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting. </p><p>  Five Rivers Ireland (FRI) is the company that is currently providing this emergency place of safety service on behalf of the HSE. The purpose of this service is to provide placements to children where Garda&iacute; have removed children from their homes under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, outside of normal working hours, on an emergency basis. </p><p>  Since the service commenced in June 2009 there has been a steady increase in the number of calls to the CIS and EPSS and an increase in the number of children placed. This table provides further information:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total number of referrals</th><th>Placements</th></tr><tr><td>2009 (from June)</td><td>166</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>288</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>370</td><td>253</td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>712</td><td>580</td></tr><tr><td>End March 2013</td><td>167</td><td>134</td></tr></table></p><p>  In addition, the Liberty House service in Cork is run by the HSE for young people out of home and at the risk of becoming homeless. It operates through a community based multi-disciplinary team which includes accommodation workers, public health nurse and a psychologist. The service works with young people in Cork up to the age of 18 and where necessary continues to provide support to those over 18 years of age. </p><p><b>Pilot out of hours social work programme</b></p><p>  In implementing a recommendation from the Ryan report and as  part of the ongoing &lsquo;change agenda&rsquo; in Child and Family services the HSE is committed to developing the capacity of our child protection services to appropriately and effectively address the needs of children who present in emergency situations outside of normal working hours alongside the work of CIS and EPSS.</p><p>  The HSE has piloted two out-of-hours pilot projects, one in Donegal and the other in Cork. The Donegal pilot project commenced in mid 2011 and the Cork project in the third quarter of last year.  Both projects involve the provision by local HSE staff of social work support out-of-hours where deemed necessary by Garda&iacute;.    </p><p>  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin. The HSE has reviewed the recommendations of the Evaluation Report and is committed to further development and expansion of the service subject to resourcing and the terms of the Croke Park agreement. In this regard, a proposal for a National Children and Families Services Emergency Out of Hours Social Work Service has been prepared.

The Department was established in June 2011 with a mandate to put in place a unified framework of policy, legislation and provision across Government in respect of children and young people.</p><p>  The responsibilities of my Department encompass a wide range of policy and service activity, both direct and indirect, for children and young people in Ireland. It has a complex mandate, comprised of a number of separate, but interrelated strands including:</p><p>- the direct provision of a range of universal and targeted services;</p><p>- ensuring high-quality arrangements are in place for focused interventions dealing with child welfare and protection, family support, adoption, school attendance and reducing youth crime;</p><p>- the harmonisation of policy and provision across Government and with a wide range of stakeholders to improve outcomes for children, young people and families.</p><p>  As outlined in my Department's Statement of Strategy, in order to achieve its goals, my Department works in close partnership with other Government departments, statutory agencies and non-governmental organisations on a range of cross-cutting issues in relation to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people. The scope of this collaboration includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p>- Department of Education and Skills (e.g. early childhood education, numeracy/literacy and skills development); </p><p>- Department of Justice and Equality (e.g. crime prevention, community sanctions, detention, diversion and equality); </p><p>- Department of Health (e.g. disability; health promotion, including nutrition and drugs policy);</p><p>- Health Service Executive (e.g. child welfare and protection, care and social services);</p><p>- Department of Social Protection (e.g. social inclusion, income support and the activation agenda); </p><p>- Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (e.g. employment creation and youth entrepreneurship);</p><p>- Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (e.g. UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and Council of Europe measures);</p><p>- Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (e.g. initiatives involving sustainable development and communities).</p><p>  While responsibility for support services for children with extra needs will remain with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills, as appropriate, my Department will continue to work closely with those Departments.</p><p>  The 2014 estimate includes a net allocation of &euro;449m for my Department which represents an increase of &euro;15m over the 2013 allocation and this clearly demonstrates the continuing commitment of this Government to the  ongoing development of quality and effective services to support children and families.</p></reply>

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Deputy will be aware that I published the Draft Heads and General Scheme for the Children First Bill 2012 in April 2012 and immediately referred the Heads of Bill to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for consideration and advice. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012. A number of submissions were received as part of the Committee's consultation process. Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In parallel with the development of legislative proposals to put </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Children First </font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">on a statutory footing, significant work has been undertaken to achieve full and consistent implementation of the revised Guidance.  I have established a </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Children First</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F"> Implementation Inter-Departmental Group (CFIDG) to bring central government oversight to the implementation process.    The direct responsibility for implementation rests at organisation level in line with the Guidance and the proposed legislation.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>  All Child Protection and Welfare referrals are managed through the HSE Children and Families Standardised Business Process. All reports of concern for the safety and well-being of a child come into the Duty/Intake team for assessment. All staff receiving such a referral are trained in the duty system and are obliged to treat seriously all child welfare and child protection concerns whatever their source. All information on the extensive process is available on the HSE website under the Standardised Business Process documentation. The full implementation of the Business Process continues to enhance the processing of all referrals throughout the country.</p><p>  A child can be placed in care either voluntarily or by court order.  In the case of the former, this happens with the consent of the parents / guardian.  Where consent is not forthcoming, the HSE is obliged to make an application to court, and the criteria set out in the Child Care Act, 1991, in respect of the relevant order are strictly applied.</p><p>  Once a child has been taken into care there are a number of national standards in place including The National Standards for Foster Care 2003 and the National Standards for Residential Care . Currently HIQA inspects HSE children&rsquo;s residential care and child protection services and  all foster care service under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Health Act, 2007, and reports on findings to the Minister. HIQA publishes inspection reports on its website. The HSE inspect and register children&rsquo;s residential centres run by the private and voluntary sectors. All inspections are undertaken against National Standards developed by the Department of Health prior to HIQA&rsquo;s establishment.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the Children Act, 2001 is shared between the Minister for Justice and Equality and myself.</p><p>  I am responsible for the 3 Children Detention Schools at Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin which provide detention places to the Courts for girls up to the age of 18 years and boys up to the age of 17 years ordered to be remanded or committed on criminal charges. I am also responsible for the child care aspects of the Children Act, 2001. </p><p>  I see the role of my Department as working in an integrated way to develop strong linkages between early prevention and intervention, developing closer working relationships between the care system and the justice system with the main focus of keeping children out of the criminal justice system.</p><p>  For those young people whose behaviour has unfortunately led to their involvement in the youth justice system and ultimately to detention, we must provide a safe and secure environment and support their early re-integration into the community. </p><p>  The principal object of the Children Detention Schools, as outlined in the Children Act 2001, mandates the provision of appropriate educational, training and other programmes which promote the reintegration of the young people back into society and promote general life skills.  </p><p>   I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service, known as ACTS, is now in place on the Oberstown campus with mental health screening training for staff having commenced recently.  This means that the Oberstown campus is now in a position to provide a more comprehensive service to young people remanded or committed by the Courts.   </p><p>  IYJS works in tandem with the Department of Education and Skills and the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, to provide the necessary and vital educational services based on the &lsquo;Education Strategy for the Children Detention School Service 2010-2013&rsquo;. It seeks to promote a whole child/whole system approach to focus on better outcomes for these children and their families.    </p><p>  My Department also provides in the region of &euro;53m to support the provision of quality youth provision throughout the country. This funding supports the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and the Local Drugs Task Force Projects.</p><p>  The establishment of my Department has led to a stronger focus on issues affecting children. The care and welfare of children is at the centre of my political responsibility as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the forthcoming establishment of the Child and Family Agency will further strengthen the focus on delivering safe and effective services for children and families who need a wide continuum of supports and interventions.</p></reply>

They are also engaged with my Department in relation to the potential contribution of the youth sector to the measures to implement the Youth Guarantee. The National Youth Council of Ireland  has a lead role in carrying out the EU structured dialogue process with young people in Ireland and the youth sector are represented on the  National Steering Committee chaired by my Department.</p><p>  It is planned that youth organisations will have a significant role in the new youth strategy which is being developed in my Department for completion in 2014. The next stage of the development of the youth strategy will include a consultation process with youth organisations, other youth stakeholders and young people themselves. I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet, regularly with many youth organisations and groups to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, 44.6% of the Irish population have private health insurance and many people opt to be treated privately. The Irish hospital system contains a mix of public and private hospitals, with public hospitals treating both public and private patients. On admittance to a public hospital, patients make a choice to be treated on a public or private basis by their medical consultant. </p><p>  My Department has no plans to carry out an economic assessment into the financial impact of patients presenting in public hospitals who previously held private health insurance. It is not known how many persons who previously held private health insurance will subsequently present for medical treatment in a public hospital setting over a future period of time, nor is it possible to predict with any certainty how many people currently holding private health insurance will instead choose to be treated as a public patient, as they are fully entitled to do. Given the above,  it is not possible to quantify the direct impact any reduction in numbers of persons holding private health insurance might have on the public hospital system. </p><p>  My Department will continue to oversee the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2012, and to monitor developments on an ongoing basis, to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately in the transition to a market-based Universal Health Insurance system.</p></reply>

No 328 of 1988) requires pharmacies to maintain a controlled drugs (CD) Register in respect of all drugs listed in Schedule 2, including methadone. All entries must be recorded in a chronological sequence and in a manner which shows a running balance.</p><p>  Inspections are carried out by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) under Section 67 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 to review compliance with the Act, regulations made thereunder and medicines legislation. The sale and supply of all Schedule 2 controlled drugs and the manner in which the CD Register is maintained are checked as part of these inspections. The Register is reviewed to see if running balances are properly maintained. The physical inventory of three controlled drug preparations is counted during each inspection.  The physical tally is then checked against the balance indicated in the CD Register to see if they match. The manner in which the findings are reported does not differentiate the record keeping requirements observed for methadone from other Schedule 2 controlled drugs. </p><p>  As part of the registration process for retail pharmacy businesses, pharmacy owners and Superintendent Pharmacists are required to notify the PSI if the pharmacy concerned is engaged in the sale or supply of methadone. As at 7th   November 2013 records indicate that 753 Pharmacies are engaged in the sale and supply of methadone. </p><p>  To date in 2013, the results of 364 pharmacy systems inspections were recorded in the PSI inspection database. These show that 37 pharmacies failed to record or properly record the running balance in respect of one or more Schedule 2 controlled drugs in the CD Register, and in 104 cases the physical inventory did not agree with the balance specified in the Registers.</p><p>  In 2012, 75 pharmacy systems inspections were carried out, of which 59 were recorded in the inspection database when it went live during the year. The results show that   4 pharmacies failed to record or properly record the running balance in respect of one or more Schedule 2 controlled drugs in the CD Register, and in 8 cases the physical inventory did not agree with the balance specified in the Registers. The records of those pharmacies notified to the PSI as selling or supplying methadone for 2011 and 2012 are held in paper copy only and a review of all 1,600 paper files would be required to establish the number of pharmacies that supplied Methadone at that time. The data obtained during inspections in 2011 was not recorded on a computer database, and accordingly detailed information regarding regulatory compliance with the requirement to maintain the CD Register is not readily available for 2011. </p></reply>

This transitional period closed on the 31 May 2013.Thereafter, any social worker wishing to use the title is required to be registered. </p><p>  The registration process requires that graduates, new entrants to the profession in Ireland or those who have been practising abroad hold approved qualifications, complete their application form, provide their supporting documentation and demonstrate they are fit and proper to practise the profession.</p><p>  The verification process is thorough so as to ensure that the necessary checks are carried out on each application, ultimately ensuring that the public can have confidence that the professional providing the service to them is properly qualified, competent and of good standing. It is, by necessity, a detailed engagement that includes Garda vetting, a process which can take up to 12 weeks but is again considered necessary to satisfy the Registration Board that all applicants meet the criteria for registration.</p><p>  It should be noted, that in the case of Social Worker registration, even though existing practitioners had a two year period during which to register, May 2011 to May 2013,  the majority of Social Workers chose to register in late May 2013.  This, along with incomplete documentation provided by many applicants has meant that the average processing period is currently 16-20 weeks.  </p><p>  I am advised that any applicant who is concerned around employment opportunities should make contact with CORU directly. These applications are being prioritised.  </p></reply>

I met the three support groups representing the women concerned in August 2013. At that meeting, I proposed to appoint a judge to meet with the women in order to facilitate decisions on how best to bring closure for the women concerned.</p><p>  My officials are actively considering this issue and I intend bringing proposals to Government in the coming weeks. I intend to publish the Walsh report when I have received Government approval regarding how best to proceed in relation to this issue.    </p><p>  My priority continues to be to ensure that the women who have had this procedure have their health needs comprehensively and professionally met. In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who may be experiencing any adverse effects as a result of undergoing this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.</p></reply>

A range of measures including the Common Waiting List, Special Delivery Unit<b></b>and the Outpatient Services Performance Improvement Programme are on an ongoing basis working to manage and eliminate waiting lists and improve patient access.</p><p>  Implementation of Consultant Contract 2008 is a matter for the HSE in the first instance. The Contract sets out clear rules on the permitted ratios of public-private practice and the measures to  ensure that these provisions are complied with. Depending on contract type, a consultant may have no access to private practice (Type A contract holders), a cap of 20% private activity for newly appointed consultants (Type B)  or a cap of up to 30% in the case of certain existing consultants. Under the Public Service Agreement, following negotiations at the LRC in September 2012, health service employers and the consultant representative bodies agreed a range of measures  to support improved patient care, including a renewed commitment to consultant compliance with the limits on private practice activity.</p><p>  The HSE has confirmed that compliance with permitted private practice levels continues to be monitored at hospital level and that the relevant provisions of the contract may be applied  in cases where a consultant breaches the permitted ratio and does not take the necessary steps to bring his/her private practice back into line with the permitted level. </p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness or disability.</p><p>  Under this legislation, the determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Section 45 requires the HSE to have regard to a person's, and their spouse or partner's overall financial situation in view of their reasonable expenditure. The HSE gives effect to this legislation and Government policy through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  Where a person's income is in excess of the income thresholds set out in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable, due to undue hardship, to arrange a GP service. In doing so, the HSE is obliged to have regard to the financial situation and expenditure of the individual and his or her dependents. </p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill in palliative care, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness in palliative care, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.  As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure. </p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014, when the specifics of the legislation are known.  </p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to health care for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p></reply>

In the context of the employment control framework numbers employed in the health service must be further reduced.  While it is a matter for the HSE to determine the composition of its staffing complement, it is important not to underestimate the significant role that management-administrative staff play in the direct support of front line services. </p><p>  Administrative staff ensure that the service runs as smoothly as possible, for example staffing ED reception, organising OPD clinics, processing medical cards, collecting income due, managing the health service budget and paying its staff.  Managers are essential also in such a complex system and those earning over &euro;100,000 have taken the biggest reductions in recent years, while shouldering substantial responsibility for the delivery of essential services and functions at national and regional level.  The HSE has operated a general moratorium on the filling of management-admin posts in recent years, so as to focus development funds as far as possible on the front-line.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the tools are available to the HSE to ensure that the correct number and mix of staff is available in accordance with its business needs and government policy on public service numbers.  In this regard, 78 management-administrative staff have recently been approved for incentivised career breaks and it is anticipated that in 2014, the HSE will begin to offer voluntary redundancy on a targeted basis to staff identified as surplus to requirements. </p></reply>

Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines. They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The second and third lists containing groups of esomeprazole and rosuvastatin products were published on the 20th and 24th September, respectively. The fourth and fifth lists containing groups of omeprazole and pravastatin products have also been published (on the 11th and 22nd October, respectively).

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness or disability.  Under this legislation, the determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Section 45 requires the HSE to have regard to a person's, and their spouse or partner's overall financial situation in view of their reasonable expenditure. The HSE gives effect to this legislation and Government policy through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.  Where a person's income is in excess of the income thresholds set out in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable, due to undue hardship, to arrange a GP service. In doing so, the HSE is obliged to have regard to the financial situation and expenditure of the individual and his or her dependents.</p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill in palliative care, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.  For persons with a terminal illness in palliative care, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.  As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure.  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014, when the specifics of the legislation are known.</p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p></reply>

However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so.</p><p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the necessary statutory arrangements to fully implement the Directive and draft legal provisions to put in place the statutory provisions for these arrangements are being prepared and will be implemented as soon as possible.  Nevertheless, there are administrative arrangements in place in respect of the key provision of the Directive in relation to a national contact point (NCP), which has been set up within the HSE.  The principle function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost, the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. Patients&rsquo; requiring information on Ireland's implementation of the Directive may access NCP information on the Cross Border Directive (CBD) through the HSE&rsquo;s main website.</p></reply>

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</p></reply>

The implementation of a health identifier will greatly add to patient safety and administrative efficiency. It is also a crucial building block for Money Follows The Patient and Universal Heath Insurance, both cornerstones of the Government Reform Agenda. </p><p>  The implementation of a sectoral health identifier, separate from the PPS number, was recommended in the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) report &quot;Recommendations for a Unique Heath Identifier for Ireland&quot; (2009) and is in line with recommendations made by the  Commission on Patient Safety in their 2008 report  &quot;Building a Culture of Patient Safety&quot;.  A sectoral identifier for health will provide the best assurance to the public of the confidentiality of their medial records.</p><p>  Implementation of a patient identifier is recognised as being an essential infrastructural initiative which will facilitate many significant improvements to the health system in areas such as reduced adverse events and improved data access and quality. It will provide many revenue and cost recovery/avoidance opportunities and it is also a fundamental requirement for deploying e-Health solutions.  It is not practicable at this point to quantify in monetary terms the savings arising from implementing a system of individual health identifiers because the savings will accrue from the subsequent developments and opportunities made possible by the systems of unique identification rather than the system of unique identification itself.</p><p>  It is intended that the health identifier will leverage the existing identity management infrastructure administered by the Minister for Social Protection, including the Public Services Card, which is currently being deployed.  </p><p>  My Department is engaging with all relevant stakeholders including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Data Protection Commissioner and  HIQA in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees.  This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the full year cost of this measure.  The estimated cost is based on an estimation of additional capitation costs, practice support costs, and other claims costs under the current GMS GP reimbursement arrangements. </p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation.  The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014 when the specifics of the legislation are known.  </p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to health care for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health and Children has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service and has agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal primary care health service as a first step towards the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.  A range of options are under consideration with a view to bringing developed proposals to Government shortly. The additional cost of providing access to GP services without fees for the entire population, i.e. those not currently covered by the GMS scheme, based on current rates of payments to GPs, is estimated to be between &euro;330 million and &euro;365 million. </p></reply>

However, the Deputy may be interested to note that a National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme has been developed and is being implemented on a phased basis.  The programme will improve patient access and manage patient care in an integrated manner across service settings, resulting in better outcomes, enhanced clinical decision making and the most effective use of resources.</p><p>  On the broader issue, the Deputy will be aware that the Government decided that public service numbers must be reduced to assist in meeting budgetary targets.  The health sector is making its contribution to that reduction; nonetheless, the HSE can appoint staff once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the resources to do so.  The Croke Park Agreement and the Haddington Road Agreement have enabled services to be sustained despite a reduction in staffing of over 11,000 or 10% wholetime equivalents since the end of 2007.  </p><p>  I should also draw attention to the fact that public hospitals are being reorganised into more accountable hospital groups.

Within its capital budget, therefore, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter for the NRA.  However, it is important to stress that the NRA is not responsible for planning restrictions along proposed new routes for roads, rather any such restrictions are a matter for the relevant local authority in their capacity as the relevant planning authority.    </p><p>  It is the case, in the context of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework 2012-2016, that there will be limited scope to progress new road development projects in the short to medium term and that there are  projects which have reached route corridor selection phase but which will not progress to construction for some time.  As I have indicated previously I am reluctant to cancel such projects given that they are designed for their long term benefit to the State although I am conscious of the potential implications for development in the area.</p><p>  Just because it is unlikely that a transport infrastructure project will be progressed in the short to medium term does not mean that project should be cancelled, and protections for the route be removed by the relevant planning authorities.  For example, in the case of the Harcourt Luas Line and the M50, there were significant passages of time between initial reservations being made and construction commencing on those projects. Therefore, I think it best that the decision on such matters is made by the relevant local authorities in their capacity as planning authorities.  They are in the best position to assess how best to balance development needs in the area with protecting route corridors for future road or other transport upgrades. </p></reply>

This interval is not determined by the time the vehicle is or has been in use or by mileage. The testing regime is aimed at detecting any wear and tear, deterioration or alterations that could affect the roadworthiness or safety of a vehicle.  Vehicles which are off the road can degrade and deteriorate so it is just as important that they are tested and it is an offence to use a commercial vehicle (including a trailer) in a public place without a current Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW) .     </p><p>  The period of validity of a CRW is calculated by reference to the last test due date.  A delay in completing the test has the effect of reducing the validity period of the CRW.  In cases where a vehicle is overdue its test by more than one year and is presented for testing, the regulations provide that the period of validity for the CRW shall be either 6 months falling after the testing date or a validity period determined by reference to the date of the anniversary of the test due date whichever is earlier.  This provision was introduced in order that an operator who did not test a vehicle by the due date did not gain any economic advantage over an operator who tested their vehicle in accordance with the legal requirements.     </p><p>  While the Road Safety Authority is currently reviewing the arrangements applying to vehicles which have been off the road for more than a year, it is nevertheless important to retain the fundamental basic premise of having a commercial vehicle tested annually so that our roads are safer for everyone.  However, I will ask that the Deputy's suggestion is considered as part of the RSA's review.   </p></reply>

The derogation was introduced to allow a five-year period within which vehicles operating at heights in excess of the new limits could be withdrawn from use in Ireland or to allow for the necessary height reductions by operators. This derogation expired on 31st October 2013 and I have no proposals to amend it.   </p><p>  Given the lead-in time that this height limit has had, any amendment to current vehicle height regulations would have the effect of penalising those operators who have adjusted their fleet to ensure compliance with this well flagged law, while rewarding those that did not. </p></reply>

It is my preference that the base would remain open and that the staff should be normal Aer Lingus employees and that the additional jobs would go to normal Aer Lingus employees. The only way to achieve that, however, is for Impact and Aer Lingus to come to an agreement at the LRC and I hope they will be able to do that.</p><p>  The State's 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus does not allow it to interfere in the day-to-day commercial operations of the company. Aer Lingus is a publicly quoted company and decisions regarding the company&rsquo;s employees based at Shannon are a commercial matter for the company.  As Minister I have no role in such decisions. However,  I have communicated my preference to the Government-appointed members of the Aer Lingus board.</p></reply>
