    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100047#WRA00500"><p>The February 2013 transactions in relation to the liquidation of IBRC and the exchange of the Promissory Notes for Irish Government bonds are expected to result in GGB and GGD benefits over time but there are potential upfront costs for the State that may be incurred.  The two principal transaction costs are the payments required to be made by me, in my capacity as Minister for Finance, under Government guarantees and any payments to be made to NAMA to cover any shortfall (should one arise) following the sale of IBRC&rsquo;s assets by the Special Liquidators.   It was initially estimated that there could be payments required to be made by the Minister for Finance under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme of circa &euro;0.9 billion to &euro;1.1 billion.  The ELG Scheme provides an Irish State guarantee for specific issuances of eligible debt securities by participating institutions and for specific deposits placed with participating institutions.  Any such payments would impact on GGB and GGD in the year that the transaction takes place.  From an impact analysis perspective, it was initially assumed that ELG costs of &euro;1.0 billion will arise in 2013, i.e., the midpoint of the circa &euro;0.9 billion to &euro;1.1 billion estimated range.  An updated assessment of the expected ELG costs has been prepared by the Special Liquidators.  This revised estimate now suggests that ELG costs will be in the region of circa &euro;1.0 billion.</p><p>  A Derivatives Guarantee is also provided by the Minister for Finance which guarantees all amounts payable by IBRC to derivative counterparties.  It was not possible to produce a meaningful estimate with respect to potential costs under the Derivatives Guarantee at the time of the transaction.  An assessment has now been prepared by the Special Liquidators which suggests that costs under the Derivatives Guarantee are expected to lie within the &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million range.</p><p>  Separately, a Deposit Guarantee Scheme is in place which provides a guarantee of up to &euro;100,000 per eligible depositor per institution.  This scheme is funded by credit institutions lodging funds in a Deposit Protection Account maintained at the Central Bank.  An assessment of the expected DGS costs has been prepared by the Special Liquidators, which suggests that DGS costs are expected to be less than &euro;50 million.  In any case, any payment from this fund does not represent a direct cost to the Minister for Finance.</p><p>  So the total cost to the Exchequer as a result of the liquidation of IBRC is expected to be circa &euro;1.1 billion, comprising costs under the ELG Scheme of circa &euro;1.0 billion and costs under the Derivatives Guarantee of circa &euro;50 to &euro;100 million.  This is broadly in line with initial estimates produced by my Department.</p><p>  I also want to point out that, to the extent that there were assets available to settle unsecured creditors in the liquidation process the Minister for Finance would stand pari passu with other unsecured creditors and would be entitled to a clawback of some or all of the amounts paid out under guarantees.  Indeed, the CBI would also stand pari passu with other unsecured creditors with respect to any amounts paid out under the DGS &ndash; and would, therefore, also be entitled to a clawback of some or all of the amounts paid out under the DGS depending on the availability of assets to settle such unsecured claims.</p><p>  It is also important to note that the Minister for Finance will also be required to compensate NAMA if the amount raised from the sale of assets by the Special Liquidator is insufficient to cover amounts due to NAMA.  The Special Liquidators are appointing independent valuation experts to determine the value of the assets but the shortfall, if any, will not be known, with any certainty, until the independent valuation and asset sale process has completed.	</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100047#WRA00700"><p>As I have stated previously, it is important to note that some aspects of the promissory note deal are yet to be finalised. For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments to be made under the ELG Scheme have not yet been determined. Nevertheless, simulations ran by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &#8364;1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us &#8364;1 billion closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015. However, this has to be seen in the light of the estimated General Government deficits of &#8364;8.9bn and &#8364;5.3bn in 2014 and 2015 respectively, as per <i>Budget 2013</i>  .</p><p>  While this agreement is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, this Government is well aware that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirements to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015 as per the EDP, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.  </p><p>  At this early stage of the year, I will not be drawn into speculation on the composition of the next Budget and the impact that this deal will have on it.  There are a lot of other moving parts to be considered such as economic growth, tax take and expenditure performance.  All of the above, including the impact of the promissory note deal, will form the basis of Government decisions regarding the Budget.</p><p>  In terms of a potential bank deal, Ireland&#8217;s position on this is well known. It is essential that the measures introduced for direct banking recapitalisation achieve the object of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks.</p><p>  Ireland is now in the final year of its programme. It is important that the ESM&#8217;s banking recapitalisation tool does not rule out a retroactive deal for Ireland in respect of its viable banks. This will be an essential element in helping us to regain continuous market access and help improve the sustainability of our well-performing adjustment programme. </p><p>  This message is being conveyed to my colleagues at ECOFIN where dialogue is ongoing but it is far too early to speculate the form and magnitude of any potential deal.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100047#WRA00900"><p>The Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax. This means that the property owner must decide the market value of his or her own property and make a return to Revenue. In the absence of a national residential property valuation system, the valuation guidance developed by Revenue is designed to help property owners in self-assessing the market value of their property by giving them average, indicative values for their area.   The Revenue guidance is based on a detailed analysis of all property sales in the State since January 2010. The guidance provides a benchmark to help people consider whether their particular property is more or less valuable than the average in an area. This guidance will be helpful in the majority of cases but there are always properties in an area that differ from the average.</p><p>  The valuation guidance explicitly states that: &ldquo;This service provides a guide to average market values of properties in a given locality and offers an indicative valuation band for properties depending on type, age and location. It does not provide market values for individual properties.&rdquo; </p><p>  This guidance should not be used in isolation but together with other sources of information and the property owner&rsquo;s knowledge of their neighbourhood and their own property.  In this regard, I welcome that there is a range of guidance now available to property owners to help them self-assess.</p><p>  Revenue has made the guidance as simple as possible &ndash; users need only know their property&rsquo;s type, age and location.  The Revenue valuation guidance website combines two aspects &ndash; a simple point and click option to get an average valuation for an area (electoral district), combined with a &lsquo;heat map&rsquo; showing relative valuations across electoral districts. </p><p>  The valuation guidance website is a successful collaborative project between Revenue and Ordnance Survey Ireland, the national mapping authority. The site was developed by Revenue at a cost of &euro;48,250 including VAT.  This includes the development cost, external advice on the choice of system and an estimate of the project management and quality assurance time.  For completeness, this does not include the staff time and costs attributable to the Local Property Tax project overall which could not easily be disaggregated and would have been incurred even if the valuation guidance website had not been developed.</p><p>  The Revenue guidance follows similar methods to those used by tax administrations in other countries and meets internationally accepted standards for this type of work.  In addition, it compares favourably to research in Ireland, including work by researchers in the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  Other valuation guidance and models in Ireland, for example those produced by some property or real estate listings websites, also use similar methods to providing average valuations.</p><p>  I am completely satisfied that the Revenue valuation guidance is fit for purpose and performs at least equally well, if not better, than other sources of valuation information that are available. I am confident that the Revenue valuation guidance will be useful for the majority of property owners in assisting them to value their homes. Furthermore, the use of the online mapping application, to provide the guidance, is an excellent example of the public sector using GIS (Geographic Information System) technology in a new and innovative manner.</p><p>  Finally I would point out that all Revenue is asking &ndash; and all I am asking, as Minister &ndash; is for property owners to take a reasonable view of the value of their own property, and to be honest.  The level of public debate this week on property valuation suggests that most people are engaging with the Local Property Tax, have a good general sense of the value of their property, are carrying out research to enable them to do their self-assessed return, and I welcome that.</p></reply>

There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules.  However the State could intervene, if required, to ensure that statutory redundancy is available through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to EUR600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.</p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that officials within my Department have already met with the IBOA and issues surrounding the status of the employees of the IBRC (in liquidation) were discussed.  The Special Liquidators have advised that there is ongoing interaction between the IBOA and the Special Liquidators.  The Special Liquidators met with the IBOA on Monday 11 March.  The Special Liquidators have informed me that this was the earliest possible date following the unavoidable postponement of the previously arranged meeting of Wednesday, 6 March and the IBOA&rsquo;s unavailability on Thursday and Friday, 7 and 8 March.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators are highly cognisant of the issues that the IBOA have been highlighting and that significant steps have already been taken to address those concerns including the announcement on Tuesday 19 March by the Special Liquidators that contracts of staff would be extended out to 7 August with one month&rsquo;s notice thereafter.  This should provide significant reassurance to IBRC staff relative to the common position in liquidations where staff contracts are terminated on liquidation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100047#WRA01300"><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the main form of criminality in the fuel sector is the laundering of marked gas oil and the sale of the laundered product as auto-fuel. Revenue is aware of the threat that this criminal activity poses to law-abiding businesses, and to the Exchequer in terms of lost revenue from mineral oil tax. The laundering process also threatens the environment, through the waste sludge that it generates, and laundered fuel can damage the engines of vehicles in which it is used.    Combating this illegal activity is, therefore, a high priority for Revenue and enforcement action is taken at all stages of the fuel supply chain, against both those involved in the laundering process and those who sell laundered fuel. Considerable success is being achieved in this work. During 2012 11 oil laundries were detected and laundering equipment, materials and vehicles were seized, along with 199,000 litres of oil. A further 914,000 litres of illicit fuel were also seized, the greater part from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. In addition, 57 retail outlets were shut down in the course of 2012 for trading without a licence for the sale of fuel or for breach of licence conditions, following the closure of 32 outlets during 2011.</p><p>  Because of the links that organised criminality has with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it. A Cross-Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, involving all relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland, also facilitates and enhances cooperation in dealing with this form of criminality. Arising from its work, a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, which operate in both jurisdictions, have been specifically targeted for investigation.</p><p>  In addition to the ongoing enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced supervision throughout the fuel supply chain, to deny fuel launderers access to marked fuel for laundering and to deny them access to market for their illegal product. Following on from a more robust approach to licensing requirements for the sale of auto-fuel adopted since 2011, a new licensing requirement for marked fuel traders came into operation from 1 October 2012. As well as these important licensing changes, there is a new requirement, effective as and from the start of this year, for all fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns on their fuel transactions to Revenue. This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity in oil trading, and in taking action against fraudulent activity.</p><p>  Revenue is also working in close cooperation with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs on obtaining an improved and more effective fuel marker. There was a very good response to a joint invitation to make submissions on the provision of a new marker, and the submissions received are being evaluated at present.</p><p>   The extensive enforcement action that is being taken against illegal activity in the fuel market highlights the commitment to combating it. The new legislative steps that have been taken, together with the work on development of a more effective fuel marker, will serve to enhance the effectiveness of this action, and there will be no letting up in the work against those involved in this form of criminality.</p><p>  On the matter of solid fuel carbon tax, the Revenue Commissioners will collect this tax on a self-assessed basis and will apply the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.  </p><p>  Any  person who makes a first supply of solid fuel in the State must register with the Revenue Commissioners and will be accountable and liable for payment of the tax. In circumstances where there are grounds to believe that a taxable supply of solid fuel has not been tax paid, including a supply by persons operating in the shadow economy, Revenue will investigate the person&rsquo;s tax liabilities in accordance with the particular circumstances of each case.  If confirmed, Revenue will enforce the collection of any unpaid tax and if offences have been committed under any part of the tax code, will take action to prosecute those offences.</p><p>  Solid fuel carbon tax will become operational in a market that is already subject to strict regulation.  Regulations to enable local authorities to control the type of coal supplied in the State have been put in place as part of the robust mechanism introduced by the Minister for the Environment to address the risk of coal products with lower environmental standards being sourced from outside the State, in particular Northern Ireland.    </p><p>  Suppliers who are producing and supplying solid fuel unlawfully are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State Agencies charged with enforcing environmental regulations and preventing such supply. Revenue will liaise with these bodies, as required, to ensure that lawful supplies of solid fuels are properly taxed.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100047#WRA01500"><p>The Government has considered the impact of the Local Property Tax (LPT) on those in mortgage arrears.  The Thornhill Group (the inter-departmental group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill to consider the design of a property tax) acknowledged that in current circumstances an additional case should be made to target assistance on owner occupiers suffering severe financial stress as a result of housing mortgage commitments undertaken during the housing boom period, aggravated in some cases by reductions in income.  The Thornhill Group recommended increased deferral thresholds in cases where the mortgage was taken out between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008.    The Government accepted the Thornhill Group&#8217;s recommendation but decided not to limit the increased thresholds to those who purchased properties during a particular time period.  Therefore, an increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds for both full and partial deferrals may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred.  </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement &#8211; i.e. a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 &#8211; may qualify for a deferral of the LPT that falls due for payment by that person during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect where a valid claim is made to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  This 2013 Act also introduces new measures which provide for the possibility of a deferral for liable persons who cannot without excessive hardship pay local property tax when it becomes payable, as a consequence of a significant and unexpected financial loss or expense (subject to the application for a deferral from the liable person to the Revenue Commissioners, in line with Revenue guidelines to be published, and notification from the Revenue that a deferral is allowed).</p><p>  The Thornhill Group recommended that the LPT paid in respect of a rented property should be deductible for income tax or corporation tax purposes, in a similar manner to commercial rates and suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years. There is no provision in the legislation for such deductions at present. However, it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis, though the manner and timing of this has yet to be decided.  </p><p>  Taking all of the above measures into account, I believe any impact of the LPT on mortgage arrears will be limited.</p><p>Turning to mortgage arrears in general, this Government is conscious of the difficulty some home owners are experiencing in meeting their mortgage obligations and is committed to helping homeowners in distress to weather the recession, and to ensuring that Ireland has a sustainable housing policy. The main focus of attention is on those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty in meeting the commitments in respect of their home.  As set out in my Department&#8217;s <i>Review of 2012, </i>  much work was done in relation to mortgage arrears and personal indebtedness to assist those in difficulty. A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, was established to oversee implementation of the Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Report) Report&#8217;s recommendations. The following key milestones were delivered in 2012:</p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Bill was published by the Department of Justice in June 2012;</p><p>- The Mortgage to Rent scheme was formally launched by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in June 2012;</p><p>- A three-phased approach to establishing a comprehensive Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service to provide the necessary supports to assist people in mortgage distress was launched by the Department of Social Protection in September 2012;</p><p>- The banks, with Central Bank oversight, completed pilots and commenced the roll-out of strategies and solutions to address loan arrears and unsustainable debt in October 2012; and</p><p>- A CEO was appointed by the Department of Justice to mobilise and operationalise the Insolvency Service of Ireland in October 2012.</p><p>  The new Personal Insolvency Act was signed into law at the end of 2012. The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of unsustainable personal debt (including mortgage debt) and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement. Complementing this legislation is a comprehensive set of measures implemented by the banks following detailed consultation with my Department.  These include:</p><p>- An increase in staffing resources allocated to assisting in arrears management;</p><p>- The provision of alternative mortgage servicing arrangements; and</p><p>- A more focussed strategy encompassing engagement, stabilisation and resolution.</p><p>  In 2013 we will build on the progress made to date by continuing to lead key stakeholders, through chairing the Mortgage Arrears Steering Group, to deliver the remaining elements of the Mortgage Arrears programme by:</p><p>- The development of resolution targets by the banks, through Central Bank oversight; and</p><p>- The operation of the Personal Insolvency Act through the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p><p>  The Central Bank, which is represented in the Steering Group, recently announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks and proposed changes to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). The new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards. The Central Bank is also proposing to update the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.</p><p>  The Central Bank will assess whether the performance targets are being met. To the extent that the banks fail to meet these targets to the satisfaction of the Central Bank and within the timeframes set out, the Central Bank may take further regulatory action, which may include, without limitation, obliging a credit institution to hold additional own funds or requiring a credit institution to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets, in terms of own funds requirements. This is without prejudice to the power of the Central Bank to take regulatory action at an earlier date where appropriate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100047#WRA01700"><p>Introducing a new tax regime for residential property in such a tight timeframe has been a significant challenge for the Revenue Commissioners along with all of their other responsibilities.  Enacting the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act in December 2012 provided the basis for the development of the necessary systems.  A small number of amendments were made to the original Act, which included some further exemptions from the charge and new types of deferral arrangements.  These amendments were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 which was signed into law by the President on 13 March 2013.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) sets out how Local Property Tax (LPT) is to be administered and how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes. Since the Government&rsquo;s announcement last July that the Revenue Commissioners would be responsible for the administration of this new tax, the Commissioners have had extensive contacts with a wide range of Government Departments and Agencies through the Interdepartmental Group which was set up last August to help plan the introduction of LPT.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of payment options have been made available to liable persons, which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or by way of phased payments.  Bi-lateral meetings have been held with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that the deduction at source option from certain payments administered by these Departments would be available to property owners.  Meetings to assess progress on the necessary developments required to implement the deduction at source options are ongoing.  </p><p>  In addition, detailed discussions have also taken place with a number of private sector stakeholders including payroll administrators and payroll software specialists regarding the implementation of the deduction at source option and these groups are actively working to meet agreed timelines.  A key element of the design of the tax is that property owners will have as much flexibility as possible to spread the payment of tax in equal instalments throughout the year and this is why the facility to deduct the tax at source is of such importance.  Payment of LPT can also be made by single debit authority, debit/credit card, direct debit and cash.  The Revenue Commissioners recently published details on their website of the payment service providers who will accept cash payments of LPT at their premises and they are An Post, Payzone and Omnivend.  The three organisations concerned have a major nationwide reach that will ensure the widest possible availability of facilities where LPT payments can be made.</p><p>  The additional resources required by Revenue for 2013 are noted in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Expenditure Report 2013.  The Employment Control Framework includes 100 additional posts approved by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in the context of the introduction of LPT.  The Commissioners further advise that a Local Property Tax Branch, under the Office of the Collector-General, is now fully established in Ennis, Co. Clare to manage all aspects of the administration of the tax for both resident and non-resident customers.  The Commissioners are deploying additional staff to this Branch by reconfiguring their District structure in the South West and relocating functions from Clare to Limerick.  In addition, Revenue has contracted for external service delivery of some data capture and call centre services.  At this point, Revenue&rsquo;s dedicated LPT Helpline (at 1890 200 255) is fully functional and will be resourced appropriately to handle the anticipated high number of contacts.</p><p>  A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State which is the cornerstone of the new tax.  The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  This Register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine the Register and ensure, as far as possible, that all property owners will be contacted.  The use of multiple databases does, however, bring the risk of duplication and the Commissioners have made every effort to lessen this risk.  Another important aspect of the logistical preparations for introducing LPT has been the development of the IT systems for administering and collecting the new tax and its incorporation into Revenue&rsquo;s existing IT infrastructure.  I am advised by the Commissioners that these systems are also in place. </p><p>  The Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance includes an on-line interactive valuation guide which provides indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location. This facility was made available on the Revenue website on 10 March and has seen extensive use with almost 600,000 &ldquo;hits&rdquo; recorded in its first four days of operation.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that last week Revenue began the general issue of LPT Returns, an explanatory booklet and related information to the owners of 1.66 million properties who will be obliged to file their Returns by the relevant deadline - 7 May for those filing paper Returns and 28 May for those filing their Return on-line.  The first property owners to have received the correspondence occurred on Wednesday 13 March and up to Friday 15 March, 178,941 letters had been posted by Revenue.  The general issue of correspondence, given the volumes involved, is likely to run for four weeks.</p><p>  I am also advised that property owners will have the option of completing and submitting their LPT return in paper or by electronic means.  Revenue has developed a secure on-line system for filing LPT Returns that is user friendly and easily accessible on the Revenue website.  This on-line system also went live on 13 March.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, using the on-line system is the quickest and most straightforward way to complete and submit their LPT Returns, particularly so where there are multiple properties involved, as the system automatically calculates the LPT due for the individual properties, makes it easy to select a payment method from the wide range of options available and provides immediate access to Revenue&rsquo;s on-line valuation guide.  I am assured that all the processes and procedures required to handle the completed LPT return forms from property owners by the relevant due dates of 7 May 2013 for paper forms, and 28 May for online forms, will be in place. </p><p>  To coincide with the issue of LPT Returns to property owners, a public information campaign was launched on 7 March with a Press Conference delivered by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. This was followed by a number of radio and television interviews with Revenue spokespersons.  Over the coming months Revenue will make spokespersons available particular to local radio to provide advice. A publicity campaign targeting radio and the print media has also just commenced.  The Revenue website contains extensive information on how the tax will operate and the obligations for owners of residential properties, including Frequently Asked Questions which are updated regularly.  Revenue is also working closely with the Citizens Information Service to optimise the opportunities for property owners to get advice and assistance in completing their LPT Return.</p><p>  I am fully satisfied with the logistical planning undertaken by the Commissioners and am very pleased with the progress made to date.  I am confident that they will deliver all of the necessary milestones prior to the commencement of the new regime on 1 July 2013.</p></reply>

The appropriate amortization schedule for EFF programmes with any member country of the IMF has been agreed and set by the IMF.  This decision provides that repayments be made in 12 equal six-monthly instalments, within an outside range of four to ten years after each such disbursement. Ireland&rsquo;s amortisation schedule reflects the parameters established by the IMF Executive Board.  Given the size and structure of the IMF, with over 180 member countries, it would not be realistic to expect such a decision to be amended for one programme country in isolation.  Further, it is not the IMF&rsquo;s practice to extend repayment schedules. </p><p>  Our policy priority now is to achieve a successful and durable exit from our programme.  Discussions took place with Troika officials on exit options during the ninth review mission, which ran from 29th January to 7th February 2013 and these discussion have continued since then. The available options are being considered in the light of what is appropriate for Ireland, as a country with a well performing programme which is on track for a successful exit.  Evidently this will require further consideration and no decisions have been taken to date.</p></reply>

This was done in order to protect and preserve the value of the IBRC assets during the liquidation process and ultimately to protect the interests of the taxpayer.    NAMA has complied with this Direction and made a &#8364;1 billion credit facility available to the special liquidator. The interest rate as per the facility agreement is referenced to the daily one-month euribor rate plus a margin of 140 basis points. The facility will be advanced to IBRC (in Liquidation) as needed for both the general corporate purposes of the Company and to discharge the Company&#8217;s obligations to derivatives counterparties under derivative collateral arrangements and/or obligations to the NTMA under the NTMA ISDA Master agreement. The amounts drawn under this facility shall constitute and rank as costs of the liquidation of the Company.</p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme. The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.  My officials also meet regularly with key stakeholders at the forum of the SME Funding Consultation Committee. </p><p>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland  for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. </p><p>In addition to these lending targets,<b></b>  the banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.</p><p>  The Credit Review Office can review decisions by the banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000. The Credit Review Office is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the Credit Review Office. I have received a small number of representations from individual SMEs regarding the availability of credit. I have referred some of these SMEs to the Credit Review Office which has been able to provide assistance. </p><p>  I recently sanctioned the appointment of six additional reviewers in the Credit Review Office to ensure that SMEs appealing the banks&#8217; decisions to decline credit receive a considered and timely response to their application.</p><p>  The credit stream available to SMEs now also includes the Microenterprise Loan scheme which will facilitate up to &#8364;40 million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme can facilitate up to &#8364;150 million per annum of additional credit. The Scheme is designed for SME&#8217;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  </p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p></reply>

It is expected that IBRC loans will be acquired from the Special Liquidator on a phased basis.

NAMA has recently published, on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i> website, a <b>Request for Proposals (RFP)</b>   seeking two service providers to take over primary and special loan servicing on two distinct types of loans that may be acquired by NAMA under IBRC Act 2013 after completion of the loan sales process currently being conducted by KPMG, the Special Liquidators of IBRC :</p><p>  - The first loan type are commercial property loans, residential investment and development loans and business banking loans; and</p><p>  - The second are Personal loans, principally residential mortgage loans </p><p>  It is envisaged that NAMA, which plans to recruit staff from IBRC, will operate in close conjunction with the service providers for both types of loans, including providing them with credit, legal, treasury, finance and accounting services.</p><p>  As it is not yet clear what proportion of the current IBRC portfolio will transfer to NAMA, given that the Special Liquidators&#8217; sales process has not concluded, it is not possible to provide estimates of the employee numbers that will be involved in the new arrangements being put in place by NAMA.

In this way the Fund&rsquo;s assets can be used as a catalyst to attract additional capital for investment in the Irish economy.</p><p>  Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency in preparing proposals for legislation to reorient the NPRF into the Strategic Investment Fund. I expect to bring forward those proposals as soon as possible once that work is completed.</p><p>  The NPRF continues to work on assembling and developing a pipeline of additional commercial opportunities for the Strategic Investment Fund, which is taking place in parallel with the legislative amendment process. An investment strategy is being developed which will address the sectors and range of assets to be considered for investment.</p><p>  Within its existing statutory investment policy and in line with the SIF announcement, the NPRF has undertaken a number of investments and initiatives under which NPRF capital will be invested on a commercial basis in Ireland.  The NPRF has committed to invest in: infrastructure (&euro;250 million), PPP projects (&euro;118 million) and finance for the SME sector (&euro;500 million) and has entered into a collaborative relationship with Silicon Valley Bank. In addition, the Fund has been working closely with NewERA in respect of investment opportunities relating to the commercial semi-state sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.53.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100048#WRB01000"><p>Section 7 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that local authorities and other providers of social housing will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.  Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  To avail of the exemption from LPT, the social housing provider must operate as a charity and must have a general tax exemption granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners and officials from my Department have had extensive contacts regarding the LPT obligations of social housing providers either directly with the providers themselves (e.g. Focus Ireland) or indirectly through the Irish Council for Social Housing.  Guidelines are being developed which clarify what constitutes special housing needs and support in order to assist local authorities and other social housing providers to determine whether their properties are exempt from the charge to LPT.  Input was sought and received from representatives of social housing providers in connection with the development of the guidelines.  The draft guidelines are currently being considered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Irish Council for Social Housing.</p><p>  Where a property owned by a local authority or other provider of social housing is not exempt from the charge to LPT because it is not used to provide special needs accommodation, the Act provides that the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of zero to &euro;100,000 up to and including 2016.  This will result in an LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013 and &euro;90 per year for 2014 to 2016.  It will be a matter for local authorities and other social housing providers themselves to decide whether they will pass on the LPT liability to their tenants in the form of an increase in rent or whether they will absorb the liability without recourse to their tenants.  In addition, the Act also gives local authorities and other social housing providers until 1 January 2014 to pay the 2013 tax.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have liaised with the social housing sector to establish how local authorities and other social housing providers will provide them with information in relation to their LPT liability and the timing and manner of the payment of this liability.  All local authorities and social housing providers affiliated to the Irish Council for Social Housing have been contacted in this regard.  Revenue is anxious to ensure that any social housing providers who have not already done so should contact it as soon as possible.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Commissioners have also confirmed that in order to minimise the administration burden on these bodies, it is Revenue&rsquo;s intention to require each social housing provider to complete and submit a single LPT Return in respect of all the residential properties it owns, rather than seeking a separate Return for each individual property.  In view of the engagement that has taken place with the Irish Council for Social Housing and the specific arrangements made for the sector both in the law and in the administration of the tax, I do not propose to carry out an impact assessment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.60.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100048#WRB01700"><p>At the outset the Deputy should note that the nature of insurance is such that it is not possible to provide a definitive update on the cost of the collapse of Quinn Insurance until the bulk of the claims have been paid, which is unlikely to be for several more years yet. However the Joint Administrators when presenting their 10th report to the High Court in July 2012 indicated that the potential call on the ICF could be up to 1.65bn euro. It should be noted that the Joint Administrators have recently indicated to my Department that this position remains broadly unchanged.  The Joint Administrators pointed out in their report that the projected call on the ICF now includes accounting adjustments and considerable contingencies which it is hoped will not be called upon. They indicated that if they were to remove most of the accounting adjustments and use a &quot;<i>best estimate&quot;</i> calculation, then the call on the fund is likely to be in the range of 1.1bn euro to 1.3bn euro  rather than the 1.65bn euro for which they have provided.</p><p>  I have been advised that the Joint Administrators have undertaken a number of actions in relation to claims settlement which can reduce the ultimate claims cost. These include as part of a new enhanced governance structure the establishment of a Claims Advisory Committee (CAC) to guide and advise them and QIL management on future claims strategy and policy.</p><p>  Furthermore, to protect the Exchequer interests I have ensured that the State Claims Agency is more involved in the administration process, particularly in the claims management area, which is critical to keeping the call on the ICF down to its lowest level possible. In this respect it should be noted that, at my request, Mr Ciaran Breen, Director of the State Claims Agency has been appointed as Chair of the Claims Advisory Committee.</p><p>The position in relation to the<b></b>  Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) is that it operates under the Insurance Act 1964 which was amended by the Insurance (Amendment) Act in 2011. Its purpose is to protect policy holders in the event of their insurer becoming insolvent. It is an industry financed fund. However because the scheme is not pre-funded, the Act provides for the Exchequer to advance monies on the recommendation of the Central Bank  in circumstances where insufficient funds have been generated by an industry levy to cover a large demand.</p><p>  Under the Insurance Act 1964 the responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it to at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank. Where in the Bank&#8217;s opinion the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. On the basis of its assessment of the Fund the Central Bank concluded that a levy should be applied to industry with effect from 1 January 2012 under section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964.  This matter is kept under review by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

Significant progress in achieving this goal has already been made by this government, and this is particularly obvious since the beginning of the year.  In January, the State successfully disposed of the &euro;1bn Contingent Capital instruments in Bank of Ireland at a profit of &euro;10m. It has also agreed a deal with Great-West Lifeco to purchase Irish Life for &euro;1.3bn plus a &euro;40m dividend. The deal is historic as it was the first disposal by the State of a company acquired during the financial crisis to private owners.</p><p>  We have also replaced the annual burden of the IBRC Promissory Note with a portfolio of Irish Government bonds at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings and we have removed the guarantee of bank deposits and liabilities which dates back to September 2008.</p><p>  All of these steps have significantly improved investor&rsquo;s perceptions of Ireland and its financial sector.</p><p>  The State&rsquo;s remaining investments consist of a 99.8% equity stake in AIB, a 15% equity stake in BOI, 99.2% of the shares in Permanent TSB, preference shares with a nominal value of &euro;3.5bn in AIB and &euro;1.8bn in BOI and Contingent Capital in AIB of &euro;1.6bn and &euro;0.4bn in Permanent TSB.</p><p>  We will continue to examine opportunities to exit our remaining bank investments over time and when conditions allow.</p></reply>

It is, therefore, a matter for the Board to determine an appropriate strategy for the management of the cash reserves and assets of the Agency.  NAMA&rsquo;s cash reserves are deployed towards repaying its debt, funding capital advances to develop and complete projects, meeting its ongoing liquidity requirements, including its operating costs.</p><p>  The Deputy is aware that NAMA&rsquo;s ultimate objective is to repay over its lifetime, at a minimum, all of the Senior Bonds issued to fund the acquisition of loans.  In this respect, NAMA&rsquo;s strong cash performance since inception has enabled the Agency to repay &euro;4.75 billion in senior bonds to date and I am advised that the Agency is firmly on course to meet the target of reducing its debt by a cumulative &euro;7.5 billion by the end of 2013.  NAMA&rsquo;s ability to meet this target is important in terms of the perception of Ireland held by international investors and by the rating agencies in the context of the country&rsquo;s return to the sovereign debt markets.  The target is also monitored closely by the Troika and influences their view of Ireland&rsquo;s progress.  NAMA expects that its end-2013 debt repayment target and the full repayment of its Senior Bonds over its lifetime will be met from income generated by debtor assets and from the proceeds of asset disposals by its debtors and receivers.</p><p>  In line with the overriding objective to repay its Senior Bonds, NAMA has also outlined plans to advance substantial funding over its lifetime to preserve and enhance the value of assets securing its loans, including significant funding for assets located in Ireland.  As the Deputy may be aware, NAMA has announced that it will advance funding of up &euro;2 billion in Ireland over the next four years for the completion of projects currently in progress and the development of new projects to meet prospective supply shortages in certain sectors.  This funding will be advanced entirely from NAMA&rsquo;s cash reserves.  NAMA advises that it has already approved &euro;700 million in new advances for the completion of commercial, retail and residential projects across Ireland and over &euro;1.7 billion across the entire NAMA portfolio.  NAMA&rsquo;s objective in advancing this funding is to increase the long-term recoverable value of the assets securing its loans.  In addition, NAMA has announced plans to lend at least &euro;2 billion over the next four years in vendor finance to purchasers of commercial property securing its loans.  NAMA advises that this is one of a number of measures being implemented to help monetise its portfolio in Ireland and is part of its commitment to contribute in a tangible way to sustainable recovery in the Irish property market. Through these plans, NAMA will inject &euro;4 billion into the Irish economy over the next four years, representing a significant contribution to employment and economic recovery at a time when investment is otherwise curtailed.</p><p>  In addition to repaying NAMA&rsquo;s debts and advancing development capital to enhance its assets, NAMA will use its cash reserves to meet the agency&rsquo;s on-going funding requirements and operational expenses.  In this context I am advised the NAMA Board considers it will not require additional resources from the Exchequer over its lifetime.  The Deputy will note that NAMA&rsquo;s operating costs in 2012 as a percentage of cash generated were of the order of 3%, which is substantially lower than that of comparable entities.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, in managing its liquidity needs, NAMA must ensure that it has available liquidity over the medium term to meet all of its contractual obligations as they fall due. Such obligations include coupon payments due on its bonds and derivative contract payments. It also, as outlined, includes its day-to-day operating costs and the advances to debtors for working capital and project funding which are often required at short notice. I am advised that updated liquidity projections, based on these various expected inflows and outflows, are reviewed on a monthly basis by the NAMA board.</p><p>  The Deputy will also know that on the 7th February 2013, I issued a Direction (NAMA/3/12/IBRC Act) to NAMA pursuant to the IBRC Act 2013 to provide such credit facilities to the Special Liquidators appointed to IBRC on such terms and conditions as specified in the direction. This was done in order to protect and preserve the value of the IBRC assets during the liquidation process and ultimately to protect the interests of the taxpayer.</p><p>  NAMA has complied with this Direction and made a &euro;1 billion credit facility available to the Special Liquidators.  NAMA has made this facility available in accordance with its approved liquidity policy and from its liquid assets.  NAMA advises that the granting of this facility does not impact on the Agency&rsquo;s ability to redeem its Senior Bonds in accordance with the previously indicated redemption targets or its ability to fund its operational and development capital costs.</p></reply>

Eligible deposits in IBRC are covered by joint safeguards. Eligible deposits of up to &#8364;100,000 for an individual and &#8364;200,000 for individuals with a joint account in IBRC are protected by the DGS. Eligible deposits above this limit are guaranteed under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG). There is no need for depositors to make a claim for compensation under the DGS. The Special Liquidators have provided details of eligible depositors and account balances to the Central Bank. Payments are then made by cheque within 20 working days of the appointment of the Special Liquidators and are sent to depositors at the address held by IBRC. In a limited number of circumstances, additional information may be required to confirm eligibility. In this instance, a formal claim is required. Depositors will be contacted but may also download relevant forms from the Central Bank website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i>. The Central Bank are keeping customers of IBRC informed by providing regular updates on its website.</p><p>  The compensation payments have been made from the Deposit Protection Account (DPA), operated by the Central Bank of Ireland and funded by credit institutions covered by the scheme.  Each deposit-holding institution is required to maintain a balance on their DPA account of 0.2% of their total deposits (with a minimum amount of &#8364;50,000 in the case of all institutions except credit unions). The balance in the DPA was &#8364;388 million prior to this compensation event.</p><p>  There are no specific plans at national level to alter the operation of the DGS. However, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) in Ireland was established under Irish and European legislation to protect depositors; it therefore will be impacted by European legislation on the operation of Deposit Guarantee Schemes across Europe, which is currently the subject of negotiations.</p><p>  On 12 July 2010, the Commission adopted a legislative proposal for a thorough revision of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The main aim of the 2010 proposal is to significantly enhance depositors&#8217; confidence by introducing a higher level of coverage, faster payout and more credible funding of the various Deposit Guarantee Schemes. This proposal will now travel as part of the Banking Union Proposals. It addresses issues including simplification and harmonisation of the provisions of the current Directive. In particular, it looks at the scope of the coverage and arrangements for payout; optional mutual borrowing among Deposit Guarantee Schemes in certain circumstances, the introduction of an information template and better access to information for depositors.</p><p>  The European Parliament voted in Plenary on the Deposit Guarantee Schemes proposal on 16 February 2012. This vote took place in the absence of an agreement with the Council on a number of key issues. The file is now effectively at a second reading.</p><p>  The last Council Working Party (attach&eacute;s) took place on 23 July 2012 in an attempt to restart the negotiation of the proposals. However, Member States were unwilling to reopen the debate fully until the Banking Resolution package is near completion as it is heavily linked to this proposal, especially with respect to the funding of the schemes. It appears that the funding issues will now be discussed in the context of Bank Recovery and Resolution Proposals and therefore as Presidency Ireland will recommence discussions of the DGS proposal in the coming weeks with a view to agreeing with the European Parliament improvements to the operation of DGS schemes across Europe in the near future.</p></reply>

At the same time, the boards and management must ensure that the day to day running of the institutions has regard to competition, market conditions and the need to develop stable commercial enterprises to meet the long term credit needs of households and businesses. It is important that the banks in which the state has an ownership interest are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  It must be remembered that in order to fund mortgages the banks must borrow at current wholesale rates which are currently higher than the ECB base rate and must ensure that the rates at which they lend are economically sustainable and provide a return for the banks and ultimately the State as their shareholder.</p></reply>

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.   The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. The Credit Reviewer, Mr John Trethowan, said in his most recent quarterly report that &#8220;Both banks have achieved their &#8364;3.5bn SME loan sanction targets. Over &#8364;8bn was sanctioned in 2012; of which approx. &#8364;2.5bn (27%) is new lending drawn down.&#8221; According to the Credit Review Office, the balance of the sanctioned lending represented restructured or re-financed credit to SMEs. The Credit Review Office in the past has noted that this is important in terms of sustaining the businesses and the associated jobs.  </p><p>In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b></b>  the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks have submitted their lending plans for 2013 to my Department. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, has analysed the plans and has met with the banks to discuss them. The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department. My officials and I will engage robustly with the banks to ensure that they meet their 2013 targets. I think that it is important to note that the targets for 2013 represent an increase of 33% over the 2011 targets. </p><p>  My Department&#8217;s review of 2012 is available at <i></i> .  It contains details of some of the actions taken in 2012 including demand surveys, ongoing consultation with the SME sector, initiatives with the banks, the Credit Review Office review and increase of its resources and NPRF funds for the SME sector. </p><p>  Access to Finance for SMEs is a key aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. It is the Government&#8217;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. </p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group was established in 2012 to both develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation. It will continue in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee. My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance. </p></reply>

However, I have been informed by the Central Bank that one of the recommendations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt was that a &#8220;standard financial statement&#8221; (SFS) should be developed for use by all lenders and MABS, to assess a borrower&#8217;s financial position and to identify a best course of action.  A standard format for the SFS was developed by the IBF and MABS and approved by the Central Bank in 2011 and all lenders are required to use this SFS when dealing with consumers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.</p><p>  The SFS is a key component to the effectiveness of the MARP as it requires consumers to objectively assess their incomings and outgoings, assets and liabilities and it provides the lender with valuable information regarding the financial position of the borrower.  The standard format for the SFS requires a comprehensive review of the borrower&#8217;s financial position and brings increased consistency to the process and ensures that all assessments of a borrower&#8217;s case are based on a common analysis of their financial circumstances.</p><p>  Guidance has been prepared for consumers by MABS and the Central Bank which informs the borrower of the importance of completion of the SFS and also the commitment of their lender to assist them with the process.</p><p>  The Central Bank published a consultation paper as part of a review of the CCMA on 13 March 2013 and the use of the SFS is being considered as part of this review.  In this regard since the introduction of the SFS, a number of wide ranging, and sometimes contradictory, views have been expressed.</p><p>  Some lenders have highlighted borrower dissatisfaction, as well as their own concerns, that the level of information sought is excessive, particularly in respect of borrowers with a more straightforward arrears situation (for example, where the borrower has had a one-off unexpected expense which has temporarily created an arrears issue). In addition, some lenders maintain that the time taken to complete and assess the SFS is leading to delays in putting arrangements in place, which can result in a deterioration of the borrower&#8217;s position, while they are awaiting the completion of the review.</p><p>  However, the consumer research conducted on behalf of the Central Bank concluded that 71% of borrowers surveyed were satisfied with the overall ease of completing the SFS. In addition, a number of lenders have expressed the view that the full range of information contained in the SFS is relevant and necessary in order to facilitate full consideration of the borrower&#8217;s situation. This view is supported by the Central Bank&#8217;s analysis of data from the main lenders.</p><p>  In recognition of the time it may take to complete and assess the SFS and the potential deterioration in a borrower&#8217;s arrears situation while this process is being carried out, the Central Bank is proposing to clarify that a lender may put a temporary arrangement in place for a period of no more than three months, prior to receiving, and completing a full review of, the SFS.</p><p>  In addition, a new requirement is proposed for lenders to offer to assist borrowers in completing the SFS.</p><p>  The Central Bank agrees that there may be some situations where the full range of information contained in the SFS is not required, and is seeking views on those potential situations and the information that would be required in each situation to facilitate proper consideration of the borrower&#8217;s case.</p><p>Further details on the full consultation can be found at following link:  <i><i> </i></i> .</p></reply>

The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement.  It does not preclude, however, borrowers and lenders reaching bilateral agreements to address mortgage or other debt difficulty.</p><p><b>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:</b>    As announced last week, the implementation of the mortgage arrears strategies has further intensified with the Central Bank now setting time bound and measurable targets for the main banks on their progress in resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage. The &#8220;Keane Report&#8221; has already outlined a number of possible options that can be considered by banks to provide a sustainable solution for a mortgage in difficulty on a case by case basis.</p><p><b>Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:</b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of additional information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie </i> , has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which is established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.</p><p><b>Keeping families in their homes:  </b>  As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option will be available to households with unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support and meet other appropriate criteria and will allow the family, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.</p></reply>

This approach has been endorsed by the G20.   A draft of the OECD BEPS report was discussed at a recent meeting of the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs in Paris in January at which officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners were in attendance. The OECD will now prepare an action plan by June this year to examine next steps.</p><p>  Ireland welcomes the report of the OECD on this very important topic, and also the coordinated effort at OECD level to deal with the challenges BEPS poses. The report provides a very good overview of the root causes of BEPS, and highlights the key pressure areas to be considered in formulating a comprehensive action plan by June. Ireland, along with all other OECD members, is actively involved in focus groups established with the aim of developing the action plan.</p></reply>

Revenue is making it as easy as possible for people to comply with their obligations to submit an LPT return and either make arrangements to pay their LPT charge or avail of a deferral of the charge if they are eligible.  A wide range of payment options will be available to liable persons, which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or to pay the tax in equal instalments beginning in July 2013.     For those liable persons who choose not to make an LPT Return, the Revenue Commissioners have a duty, in the interests of fairness and equity to those who are compliant, to take effective follow-up action to recover the tax from the non-compliant.  </p><p>  As part of the general issue of LPT Returns that began last week, liable persons are also receiving a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of individual properties; nor, since LPT is a self-assessed tax, should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that a liable person should pay.  The Revenue Estimate is an amount of LPT that will be pursued by Revenue, in accordance with the LPT legislation, if the liable person does not complete and submit their LPT Return.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their initial compliance focus will be on the completion of the register and they will decide on the precise details, phasing and timing of the compliance campaign depending on the profile of the non-compliant population.  In the first instance, the Commissioners will pursue payment of the Revenue Estimate by mandatory deduction at source.  In these cases the non-compliant liable person will be notified prior to any such mandatory deductions taking place and an instruction will issue from Revenue to the liable person&#8217;s employer, pension provider or to certain Government Departments to deduct the appropriate amount of LPT from the liable person&#8217;s employment income, occupational pension or from certain Government payments.  These instructions will be the same irrespective of whether the deduction payment option has been voluntarily selected by the liable person, or mandatorily imposed by Revenue.  If a liable person subsequently files the LPT Return and confirms the amount of LPT due based on her/his assessment of the value of the residential property<b>, </b>  Revenue will notify her/his employer, pension provider or Government Department, as the case may be, if the amount of LPT due for payment has changed.  </p><p>  As regards timing, the objective will be to spread the deductions evenly over as many pay periods as possible.  In this context, it is anticipated that the compliance campaign will commence in the second half of June, and will focus initially on income from employment and occupational pensions with a view to beginning deductions from July pay dates.  A second and later phase will focus on Government payments, and in this regard the Deputy should note that if a person&#8217;s sole income is a payment from the Department of Social Protection, her/his income will be below the thresholds to qualify for a deferral of the tax.  The timing of deductions from payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will depend on the timing of the relevant payments.</p><p>  Where deduction at source is not feasible, which will generally be in the case of self-assessed taxpayers, a liable person who submits their Income Tax or Corporation Tax Return but has not by then submitted their LPT Return or paid or entered into an arrangement to pay the tax will automatically incur a 10% surcharge on the Income Tax or Corporation Tax liability for the particular year of assessment or accounting period.  This will be the case even where the Income Tax or Corporation Tax return is itself filed on time.  Where the liable person subsequently submits the outstanding LPT Return, the surcharge will be capped at the amount of the LPT liability.  The timing in the case of Corporation Tax will vary, but for income tax the relevant date is 31 October 2013 for paper filers, and such later date as the Commissioners may announce as the filing date for e-filers, usually within the following two weeks.</p><p>  I am further advised that the normal compliance and debt recovery provisions apply to LPT as apply to the collection and recovery of other taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Finally, any unpaid LPT will attach to the property, and the liable person will not be able to sell or transfer the property without paying the LPT, interest and penalties due.  The Revenue Commissioners are discussing the details of the processes with the Law Society, but it is envisaged that solicitors will be in a position to verify that LPT has been paid to enable them to properly complete conveyancing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.114.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032100050#WRD00300"><p>In February 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government established an Inter-Departmental Group under the chairmanship of Dr. Don Thornhill &ndash; the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo; &ndash; to consider the structures and modalities for a full property tax. As part of their terms of reference the Thornhill Group were to consider the design of a property tax to replace the household charge which is equitable and is informed by previous work and international experience. In designing the tax the Thornhill Group were guided by, inter alia, the principles of simplicity, transparency, equity and efficiency.    The Thornhill Group had due regard to issues such as ability to pay and considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship.  </p><p>  When considering reliefs, the Thornhill Group had regard to the following issues:</p><p> - The arrangements for payment of tax due arising from the ownership of properties should have regard to the ability of the owners to pay. </p><p> - Reliefs create costs which have to be paid for &ndash; either by taxpayers not benefiting from them, or by reductions in public expenditure.</p><p> - Reliefs should be designed to address clear economic and social policy needs.</p><p> - Considerable care would need to be taken in designing reliefs to ensure that the gains from the reliefs are targeted based on need and that there are not unintended and inequitably distributed gains.</p><p> - The LPT will not be assessed on incomes. </p><p>  The Thornhill Group favoured allowing voluntary deferrals rather than waivers. Deferrals focused on particular categories of householders can address cases where there is an inability to pay the LPT.  Income related waivers were considered to be an inefficient and costly method of targeting reliefs. They run the risk of creating inequities between taxpayers in broadly comparable situations.   Income related waivers also create poverty traps and employment traps resulting in work disincentives.  As a general principle, eligibility for deferral should be based on gross income. </p><p>  The Group also stated that, in current circumstances, an additional case can be made to target assistance on owner occupiers suffering severe financial stress as a result of housing mortgage commitments undertaken during the housing boom period, aggravated in some cases now by reductions in income.  The Government agreed with the recommendations of the Thornhill Group with regard to income related reliefs.  The Government decided, as a matter of policy, and in order to keep the rate of the tax low, that universal liability should apply, and that reliefs should be targeted at owner occupiers where there is inability to pay the tax.   </p><p>  The deferral thresholds in the Local Property Tax legislation were based on the recommendations of the Thornhill Group.  In recommending the thresholds the Group had regard to analysis it commissioned from the ESRI.  An income level of &euro;25,000 for joint and co-owners/spouses/civil partners/cohabitees was recommended in order to enable most households in the lowest 40% of income levels to have the option of deferral.  This is considered appropriate, having regard to the findings in the ESRI study regarding potential impacts on households and having regard to the need for balance and equity in terms of the burden thereby imposed on those with higher (but still average or below average) incomes.  The ESRI report notes that increasing the income thresholds will have an impact on the rate of property tax that will be applied.  As the income threshold increases the rate would also be required to increase to achieve the same revenue yields.   </p><p>  The Government accepted the gross income thresholds for a full deferral, as recommended by the Thornhill Group, and adapted the recommended gross income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &euro;10,000 rather than &euro;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral. </p><p>  Accordingly, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT for individuals on low incomes in certain cases.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral will be &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not &ldquo;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&rdquo; exceed these thresholds in that year.  </p><p>  An increased gross income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. </p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.  </p><p>  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&euro;25,000 single, &euro;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.</p><p>  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of c. 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.</p><p>  Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.  </p><p>  I appreciate that some property owners may find themselves unable to pay Local Property Tax but do not qualify for a deferral under the income thresholds.  For this reason, additional reliefs introduced in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provide that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.</p></reply>

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains. </p><p>  The Review states strong leadership will be required from the management of the institutions, with industrial relations difficulties to be addressed and managed, in order to execute the above policy.

As President of the ECOFIN Council I will continue to pursue the objectives set out in the ECOFIN work programme of the Irish Presidency of the European Union which were outlined to the ECOFIN Ministers on January 22nd last. This document set our ambitions on financial services dossiers (including the Banking Union proposals), economic governance and taxation measures.    In respect of work on the Banking Union proposals we have achieved support on a compromise package reached with the European Parliament on the Capital Requirements Directive IV.  Provisional agreement was recently reached with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The Bank Recovery and Resolution proposals are proceeding well in the Council and European Parliament. </p><p>  Making progress on the banking union proposals is of particular importance, both to Ireland and to the wider EU, as a way of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.   In so doing we will be fulfilling the goal set down by the Heads of State and Government on the 29 June 2012. </p><p>Agreement has been achieved with the Commission and European Parliament on the &quot;two pack&quot; of economic surveillance measures for the Eurozone and this reflects the final part of this set of agreed proposals on improved economic governance. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>The Irish Presidency has also worked to ensure the smooth operation<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  of the European Semester process across the ECOFIN Councils in January, February and March. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there is a need for the Presidency to remain impartial in order to be able to seek and achieve agreement with European partners on our Presidency agenda.</p><p>  That being said, I am happy to inform the Deputy that I am satisfied that there is clear awareness among my ECOFIN colleagues - and indeed across the whole EU - of the actions being taken by this Government to bring stability to our public finances and banking system and in that context an awareness of the economic sacrifices being made by the Irish people arising from these actions.  </p><p>  I am also happy to inform the Deputy that there have been some recent positive developments, which will assist in our return to more normal economic and fiscal conditions. I refer in particular to: </p><p> - The agreement at<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  the March Eurogroup and Ecofin, to ask the Troika to come forward with a proposal for their best possible option for an adjustment of the maturities on the EFSF and EFSM loans for Ireland and Portugal.  In this regard it is important to note that, in advance of the Troika coming forward with proposals at the recent Eurogroup, Finance Ministers agreed to an adjustment of maturities on the loans of the EFSF.</p><p> - The enactment of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013 to provide for the winding up of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in an orderly and efficient manner, which resulted in the removal of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) from the Irish financial system.  </p><p>  - The ending of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme for new liabilities incurred after the 28th of March 2013. This marks an additional significant step in the normalization of our banking system and reduces substantially the associated contingent liability of the State.  </p><p>  - The successful conclusion of the ninth review mission of our EU-IMF Programme. In line with each of the previous quarterly reviews, Ireland has met all of its commitments and our continued strong programme implementation has been recognized by the Troika.</p><p>  - The successful issuance of treasury bills and longer term bonds by the NTMA in 2012 and 2013, together with the continued Irish yield contraction, which shows improved sentiment and reduced risk perception towards Ireland.</p><p>  These outcomes were achievable primarily as a result of the Government&#8217;s determined and steady management of Ireland&#8217;s economy, the goodwill and support of our EU partners and the EU Institutions and the improved perception of Ireland in financial markets. These outcomes have also arisen from improving our relations with EU partners and institutions and improving these relations has been part of the aims of my Department as set out in the recently published Department of Finance Review 2012. </p></reply>

The focus by Government is primarily on formulating and implementing appropriate measures to assist those homeowners who are experiencing genuine difficulty with the mortgage repayments on their principal home.  In that regard, the &lsquo;Keane Report&rsquo; made a number of key recommendations and the Government is now actively progressing the implementation of those main recommendations. However, some of these initiatives will also be of assistance in addressing significant &lsquo;buy to let&rsquo; mortgage arrears and over indebtedness.     The Deputy will be aware that last week the Central Bank announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks in respect of principal dwelling homes and the buy-to-let sector.  This new approach is aimed at ensuring that banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting performance targets and proposing revisions to provision standards.  Banks will be required to make regular returns to the Central Bank on their performance against the published targets. The Central Bank will consider each bank&rsquo;s performance against the targets, including assessing whether sustainable solutions have been offered to customers.

However, fourth quarter data suggest that the euro area economy bottomed out at the end of 2012. Recent high-frequency indicators have provided some positive signals: euro area PMI data improved significantly in January to reach a 10-month high, the European Commission&#8217;s Economic Sentiment Indicator has increased well above economists&#8217; expectations and euro area industrial production increased by 0.7 per cent in December. In its latest assessment, the European Commission predicts subdued activity in the first half of 2013 followed by a gradual recovery in the second half of the year.    In relation to Ireland, figures published earlier today show GDP increased by 0.9 per cent last year, the second year of positive growth. While modest, the figures are encouraging. They suggest that the policy-mix sequence followed by the government has been appropriate. They also show that fiscal consolidation should not be regarded as an antithesis to growth, but rather as a precondition for it. </p><p>Nonetheless, such effort has to be balanced. Sluggish economic activity and high unemployment have broadened the consensus in Europe for policies more supportive of growth. In this regard, in June 2012, EU Heads of State or Government agreed on a &quot;Compact for jobs and growth&quot; which includes <i>inter alia</i>   reorienting of structural funds, a &#8364;60bn increase of the European Investment Bank&#8217;s lending capacity and a commitment to remove regulatory barriers to economic growth. </p><p>  Also, to prevent fiscal retrenchment from undermining growth prospects, the ECOFIN of February 2013 emphasized the importance of a &quot;differentiated, growth-friendly consolidation strategy&quot; in the EU.</p></reply>

Resources from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) will be channeled through the SIF towards productive investment on commercial terms in the Irish economy. The SIF will seek matching commercial investment from the private sector in order to maximise the resources of the NPRF.      The immediate priority for the Government is to put NewERA on a statutory footing and reorient the NPRF into a Strategic Investment Fund which will make strategic investments to support economic activity, competitiveness and employment in Ireland. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, which is the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary legislation to achieve this objective.</p><p>  Establishing a Strategic Investment Bank is a considerably more complex and time-consuming process than establishing the SIF.

It is expected that the measures will be formally adopted in May or June 2013.  One of the proposals is on the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits. The other is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance and sets out explicit rules for enhanced surveillance of countries experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties.    The key requirements under the &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo; which impact our budgetary process are:</p><p>  - The draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by the 15th of October each year; </p><p>  - The draft budget must be based on independent macroeconomic forecasts which are defined as forecasts produced or endorsed by an independent body; and</p><p>  - The budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by the 31st of December each year.</p><p>  The potential impact of these provisions on the budgetary timeline and the budgetary process are being considered and discussed by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Other relevant Departments, such as the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to the local government sub-sector of general government, are also being consulted.  When this process is completed in the near future, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I will bring a Memorandum to Government setting out our proposals to meet the requirements I set out above. </p><p>  Deputies should also be aware that the &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo; specifies that all euro area Member States, not in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, will be required to submit to the Commission and the Eurogroup and make public a draft budgetary plan, which is separate to the draft budget, no later than 15 October each year. </p><p>  The draft budgetary plan, which will be in a harmonised format, will be assessed by the Commission, which shall adopt an opinion on it by the end of November. The draft regulation also provides that the Commission may request a revised draft budgetary plan in exceptional circumstances where it identifies particularly serious non-compliance with the budgetary obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that all necessary action will be taken to ensure that Ireland complies with the new requirements.</p></reply>

The same statement also made explicit reference Ireland, noting the need to further improve &ldquo;the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme&rdquo;.  They also stated   &ldquo;when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly&rdquo;. This commitment was reaffirmed by the European Council in December, which also mandated the completion of the operational framework for the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) direct banking recapitalisation facility in the first semester of 2013.  Work is continuing at technical, senior official and Ministerial levels to complete work on the ESM&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation facility by June of this year in accordance with the mandate of the European Council.  Once this operational framework is agreed, it envisaged that national procedures to approve the instrument would be completed by December 2013. On this basis, it will be December 2013, at the earliest, before the ESM&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation instrument is available.</p><p>  Earlier this week, provisional agreement was reached between the Irish Presidency on behalf of the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).  As I have noted above, the SSM will pave the way for the ESM to take on the direct recapitalisation of banks.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is that it is essential that the measures introduced for direct banking recapitalisation achieve the object of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks &ndash; as agreed by the HoSG on 29th June last year and confirmed last December.  On the question of whether I or my officials have had related discussions with the relevant Irish banks, as the instrument is still in the design phase such discussions would be premature at this juncture. Any such dialogue should ideally await the finalisation and approval of the instrument.</p></reply>

The most recent available data indicates that, at the end of 2012, 11.9% of PDH and 18.9% of BTL mortgage accounts were in arrears of more than 90 days.  The Central Bank has informed me that it does not publish a geographical breakdown of these mortgage arrears figures.</p><p>  On 13 March 2013 the Central Bank announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks and proposed changes to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). This comprehensive approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer, conclude and implement sustainable solutions for their customers in mortgage arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards. The Central Bank is also proposing to update the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.</p><p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that, in determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the lender needs to evaluate both actual and prospective affordability for the borrower&rsquo;s affordability and the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility to minimise losses.  While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, there are some fundamental principles that must be respected in that context, including the following:</p><p> - The affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings; assumed prospective future increases in the debt servicing ability of the borrower must be credible and conservative.</p><p> - Lenders need to apply a realistic valuation of the borrower&rsquo;s assets, in particular their property.  This also applies to any assumption of potential asset price appreciation, as well as the estimated costs related to a potential foreclosure of property; and</p><p> - Lenders need to use an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender&rsquo;s cost of funds. </p><p>  The Central Bank will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications, and the durability of the restructured arrangements will be monitored and reported over time by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The first of these is EU2020, the EU&#8217;s growth strategy for the decade which aims to make the EU a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. This was followed by the European Semester to which was added the Euro Plus Pact and the so-called &#8216;six-pack&#8217; which came into effect on 13 December 2011. The &#8216;six-pack&#8217; is the name given to a legislative package, comprising five regulations and one directive, designed to reform and strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and to introduce new macroeconomic surveillance.</p><p>  The proposed &#8216;two-pack&#8217; - on which political agreement has recently been reached at EU level -<font color="#FF0000"> </font> is a further step in this process and is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the &#8216;six-pack&#8217;. It will be<font color="#FF0000"> </font>applicable to euro area Member States only. The first proposed regulation in the two-pack relates to &#8216;the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits&#8217;. The second proposed regulation under the two-pack is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance and sets out explicit rules for both enhanced surveillance and post-programme surveillance.  As part of this proposed regulation, a post-programme surveillance process will be put in place and maintained for a Member State until the balance outstanding under EU-sourced financial assistance falls below 25% of the total. This covers all EU funding sources, including bilateral loans.  Under the terms of this draft regulation, the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under post-programme surveillance to assess its economic, fiscal and financial situation.</p><p>  I should add that under the new governance rules of the EU and in particular the Euro area, a greater degree of oversight will be required for all participating Member States in the future in any event.  Taking account of lessons of the recent economic and financial crisis, this should underpin a stronger Euro zone and be of benefit to all.</p><p>  Given that EU Finance Ministers at Eurogroup and ECOFIN on 4/5 March 2013 discussed an adjustment of the maturities on the EFSF and EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal it is not possible at this time to give the duration of post programme surveillance.  The Eurogroup and ECOFIN agreed to ask the Troika to come forward with a proposal for their best possible option for both Ireland and Portugal for EFSF and EFSM loans. In addition, on Saturday last, 13 March, Eurogroup Finance Ministers agreed to an adjustment of the maturities of Ireland&#8217;s and Portugal&#8217;s EFSF loans.</p><p>  Work is continuing at official level on the adjustment of the maturities for Ireland and Portugal.  In the case of the EFSM loans, this will require discussion and agreement of the EU 27 Finance Ministers, and I expect this matter will be discussed by them in the coming weeks.  However, until a final decision by Ministers on the length of any maturity adjustment is taken, and the details of its implementation are known, it will not be possible to assess the impact of such changes on the duration of the enhanced surveillance procedure.</p></reply>

In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis which enhances the cost-effectiveness of our external representation.  Our missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.  The scale and deployment of our diplomatic network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. Any decision to adjust the State&rsquo;s external representation by closing, opening or relocating missions will have regard to national priorities and available resources.</p></reply>

My Department granted permission for the landing of 37 foreign military aircraft at Dublin Airport in 2012. By 19 March 2013, permission had been granted for the landing of 34 such aircraft.  Permission was granted in all cases subject to the normal conditions that apply to landings at Irish airports by foreign military aircraft, namely, that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations.</p><p>The table provides details of the countries involved and the number of times permission was sought to land in Dublin Airport. In the vast majority of cases, military aircraft used the landing facilities at Dublin Airport for the transport of dignitaries or other persons participating in high-level visits and official meetings in Ireland. A significant number of these landings relate to Ministerial attendance at the OSCE Ministerial meeting which was held in Dublin in 2012 and at various meetings relating to the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th>COUNTRY</th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013</div></th></tr><tr><td>BELGIUM</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>BULGERIA</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>CANADA</td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>CZECH REPUBLIC</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>FRANCE</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>GERMANY</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>GREECE</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>ITALY</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>KAZAKHSTAN</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>MALTA</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>MONTENEGRO</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>MOROCCO</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>NETHERLANDS</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>NORWAY</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>POLISH</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>RUSSIA</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>SERBIA</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>SPAIN</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWEDEN</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>SWITERLAND</td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>TURKEY</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>UKRAINE</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>YEMEN</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>37</div></td><td><div>34</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am advised that the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government will be making regulations shortly setting out the methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage.  The primary route for homeowners to demonstrate significant pyritic damage, in order to claim an exemption from the LPT, will be in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, <i>IS 398 &#8211; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &#8211; Part 1</i>.   This standard provides guidance on the visual condition assessment, sampling regime and testing to be carried out.  The standard must be used for all assessment and testing undertaken after its publication date of 29 January 2013.   The Revenue Commissioners will not be carrying out tests for pyrite.</p><p>  It is possible that some of the testing carried out prior to the publication of IS 398 may meet the requirement of the standard; however, there may be a need for some additional testing or interpretation of the testing results by a geologist.  In addition to testing, a visual condition assessment will be required to be carried out by an engineer or other competent professional to demonstrate significant pyritic damage.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the exemption cannot be claimed until such time as a certificate verifying the required level of pyrite damage has been issued by a suitably qualified professional.  The exemption will then apply for a temporary period of approximately three years, starting with the first liability date occurring after a certificate has been issued.  If a certificate has not been issued before the first or second liability dates of 1 May 2013 and 1 November 2013, a liable person will have the option, where the certificate is issued on or before 31 December 2013, to retrospectively elect for one or other of those dates to be the first liability date of the exemption period.  If a liable person makes such an election on or before 31 January 2014, any LPT that has already been paid in respect of one or both of those liability dates (depending on which date is selected) will then be repaid to the liable person by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Failure to either make a correct return/declaration or pay the correct amount in full will result in action to recover any additional tax and, where appropriate, the application of interest and penalties.  Prosecution and/or publication in the quarterly list of tax defaulters may also arise.   In addition, the Revenue Commissioners operate an extensive audit and compliance programme. Cases are generally selected for compliance intervention by reference to risk. Risk is determined by a wide number of factors including compliance history, business sector, third party information etc. It follows that the higher the risk a business or individual poses to Revenue, the greater the likelihood of a compliance intervention. Compliance interventions can range from a letter or a phone call to an interview or indeed a full audit.</p><p>  I would again point out that the Revenue Commissioners are precluded by Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 from providing taxpayer specific information to third parties including elected representatives.  However, the Deputy can be assured that his question and comments have been noted.</p><p>  As regards the accountability of the Revenue Commissioners, the position is that they are accountable to the Minister for Finance with regard to their overall performance. However, it is a long standing tradition of this House that Revenue are independent in their performance of their functions under a relevant enactment, including the Tax Acts, and this convention was given a legal basis, as recommended by the Moriarty Tribunal, in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011.  In common with all State bodies, the Revenue Commissioners are subject to audit and examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and examination by the Public Accounts Committee. They also come within the ambit of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

All monies collected from motor tax are paid into the Local Government Fund.</p><p>  In 2011 no money was transferred to the Exchequer; in 2012 a sum of &euro;46.5m was transferred from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer. </p><p>  Approximately 34% of the Fund is transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport annually for expenditure related to public transport infrastructure and for disbursement to local authorities for roads maintenance.  The costs of running the National Vehicle and Driver File are also paid to that Department &ndash; the annual cost is in the order of &euro;14.6m.  The remainder of the Fund is disbursed by my Department to local authorities, including by way of general purpose grants.</p><p>  General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time - that is a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.  </p><p>  Local authorities cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and in calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability.</p></reply>

However I would suggest that individual customers take up their concerns with the Special Liquidators and IBRC (in liquidation) directly.   I have been advised that the Liquidator is aware of a number of customers who fall outside the eligibility criteria for the ELG Scheme due to the nature of the investment product.  Unfortunately, if a customer is not eligible under the ELG scheme they will rank as an unsecured creditor in the liquidation.  I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that certain products which were liabilities of IBRC at the time of the liquidation have a structured deposit element which is covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme for that element of the product. As a result the first &euro;100,000 of any claim from these customers is covered under the DGS Scheme.</p><p>  At the time that such products were offered there was no additional guarantee provided by the State.

Section 4(6) of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 provides an exemption from payment of the NPPR Charge in the case of a residential property that is occupied as a sole or main residence by a relative or relatives of the owner of the property on a rent-free basis.  A condition that must be met for this exemption to apply is that both the property that is occupied by the relative(s) of the owner of that property, and the property that owner occupies as his or her sole or main residence, must be situated on the same property or within two kilometres of each other.    I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that this exemption does not apply in the case of the Local Property Tax (LPT).  In this regard, it should be noted that the NPPR Charge, as its name suggests, applies only to properties which are not a principal private residence of the owner, whereas the LPT applies to all residential properties with very few exceptions.  Therefore, in the scenario described by the Deputy and assuming that no other type of exemption applies, either the owner of the property or the occupants of that property will be liable to pay LPT.  Which party is liable depends on the particular arrangements that exist between the owner and the occupants in relation to the occupation of the property.  If, as appears to be the case in the scenario envisaged by the Deputy, a deed of transfer may have given the occupants an exclusive right of residence for life or for the life or lives of one or more other persons or for a period that may equal or exceed 20 years, then the occupants would be the persons liable to pay the LPT.</p></reply>

It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced. For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and this year&#8217;s Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Capital Allowance Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.</p><p><b>Index of Tables and Notes</b></p><p>a) Note on the Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009 </p><p>b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009.

A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax. An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</p><p>  The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</p><p>  In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &#8220;costs&#8221; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &#8220;loss of tax revenue&#8221; on profits. To compute such &#8220;loss&#8221;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</p><p>  The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</p><p>  The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</p><p>  The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</p><p>  The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</p><p>  In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with &#8364;1,000 gross trading profits, &#8364;1,000 capital allowances and &#8364;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &#8364;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &#8364;1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</p><p>  The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</p><p>  Apart from the artists' exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007. The restriction was extended by Section 23 of Finance Act 2010.</p><p>  Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information.</p><p><b>b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</b></p><p><b>INCOME TAX AND CORPORATION TAX</b></p><p><b>Table IT6</b></p><p><b>Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</b></p></reply>

(1) Figures accompanied by an asterisk * are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.

(2) The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits. They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.

(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.

(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.

(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a &#8220;net pay&#8221; basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.

(6) See the following note on &#8220;Green Paper on Pensions&#8221; for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures .

(7) &#8220;Other&#8221; relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership .

(8) The income on which the cost of exemption from income tax for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. is based includes dividend income on which income tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies. Information is not available about other income received gross.

(9) The cost figures for relief for certain Sports Persons are based on income tax self assessment returns and for donations to Approved Sports Bodies are based on income tax and corporation tax self assessment returns.

(10) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.

(11) The costs and numbers for the Exemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments are based on external data. From 2009 the &#8220;numbers&#8221; indicate the numbers of claims received in the year and not the numbers of claims approved.

(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2008 and 2009.

(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with &#8220;unused capital allowances&#8221;, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company&#8217;s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that &#8364;3587 million and &#8364;5373 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2008 and 2009 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.

(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2008 and 2009 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.

(15) The cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be understated by at least &#8364;100m.

(16) The costs shown for R&amp;D are for claims for R&amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2008 and 2009. However, the cost for 2009 includes the amount of credit allowed against 2009 tax together with the amount offset against tax of previous accounting periods and as payable credits.

d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions - Review of estimates of cost

  As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.

  The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2008 and 2009 are included in table IT6.

  The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years PRIOR TO 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable. further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions which is available at www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie.

e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009

  Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax - uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2008 and 2009 tax returns

  Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns. This information, derived from changes introduced by the Revenue Commissioners to income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2008 and 2009, is set out in the following tables.

  The figures shown include the amounts claimed in the year but exclude amounts carried forward into the year either as losses or capital allowances, and include any amounts of unused losses and/or capital allowances which will be carried forward to subsequent years.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-21a.213" nospeaker="true" ><p>These figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006 and which took effect from 1 January 2007.The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.

As the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and last year&#8217;s Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015.

Notes:

- The figures shown relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2008 and 2009 form 11 and CT1.

- There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.

- The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 41% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.

- Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6. However, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.

f) Note on reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates.

Examples of this type of relief would include:

Relief from averaging of farm profits;

Exemption for income arising from payments in respect of personal injuries;

Exemption of certain payments made by Haemophilia HIV Trust;

Exemption of lump sum retirement payments;

Relief for allowable motor expenses;

Tapering relief allowable for taxation of car benefits in kind;

Reduced tax rate for authorised unit trust schemes;

Reduced tax rate for special investment schemes;

Exemption of certain grants made by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta;

Relief for investment income reserved for policy holders in life assurance companies;

Relief for various business related expenses such as staff recruitment, rent, legal fees, and other general expenses;

Exemption in certain circumstances on the interest on quoted bearer Eurobonds;

Exemption of payments made as compensation for loss of office;

Exemption of scholarship income

Exemption for income received under Sceim na bhFoghlaimeoiri Gaeilge.</p></speech>

In accordance with this objective a number of sectoral measures were introduced to support employment creation as part of Budget 2012, targeting job-rich sectors such as agriculture and construction.</p><p>  I would point out that up-to-date employment data are presented in net terms and timely information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available. This unfortunately makes it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative.</p><p>  Bearing that in mind, recent signs from the labour market have tended towards the positive and sectors targeted by the Government are showing tentative signs of stabilisation. For instance, employment (seasonally-adjusted) increased over each of the last two quarters of 2012, while the standardised unemployment rate based on the Live Register was at 14.1 per cent in February, down from 15.0 per cent a year earlier.</p><p>  It should be noted that job creation measures are not limited to those contained in the Budget. For instance, research carried out by my Department and published with the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement (November 2012), suggests that the temporary reduction in VAT for the tourism sector, introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative, has had a positive impact on employment growth in this sector.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, each year my Department publishes the White Paper, detailing pre-Budget estimates of the State&rsquo;s fiscal position for the forthcoming year assuming no additional policy measures. It is worth noting that without further consolidation Ireland&rsquo;s General Government Balance, as a percentage of GDP, was projected to remain in double digit figures for 2012, at 10.0 per cent. This would have exceeded the deficit target of 8.6 per cent set under the EU-IMF Programme and is contrasted with an 8.2 per cent projected outturn for last year in the most recent forecasts.</p><p>  The Government acknowledges that the necessary consolidation can have a negative short-run impact on economic output; however, over the medium term there can be positive effects such as increased confidence and a reduction in the risk premium as the deficit is reduced and debt is put on a declining path. In addition, it must be recalled that Ireland is a small, open economy with imports comprising a large share of final demand. This means that a substantial part of fiscal consolidation leaks out of the economy in the form of lower imports.</p><p>  My Department continues to monitor high-frequency data to assess the ongoing impact of these consolidation measures on macroeconomic outturn.</p><p>  Finally, I would point out that figures published this morning show that GDP increased by 0.9 per cent last year, with domestic demand stabilising over the course of the year. This illustrates that the economy can grow even at a time of consolidation. </p></reply>

The distributional analysis is based on tables demonstrating the effects of budget changes in respect of income tax, PRSI and USC on single, married (with and without children), PAYE and self-employed income earners over a wide distribution of income levels.  The tables in the Budget Book also demonstrate the effect of changes to some payments from the Department of Social Protection such as Family Income Supplement.  </p><p>  In addition, every Budget Book contains a section which outlines the effect of Budget changes on illustrative cases.  These illustrative cases examine the effect of budget changes on various categories of income earners including single, married, lone parents and elderly in a variety of different occupations and with varying income levels and not only demonstrate the effects of the Budget tax changes but also the effect on changes to a number of payments from the Department of Social Protection such as Family Income Supplement, Child Benefit, State Pension and One Parent Family payment were relevant.   </p><p>  I expect that similar distributional analyses will be completed in the context of Budget 2014.</p></reply>

The Commission on Taxation included a comprehensive review of all tax expenditures then current in its 2009 Report, with a view to assessing their economic and social benefits.  The Commission examined tax expenditures introduced in legislation up to and including Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 which had not been repealed by legislation up to Finance Act 2009. </p><p>  Not many tax reliefs have been introduced since that time.  However, when a relief is introduced or indeed amended or abolished, this is done via the Budget and Finance Bill process.  In this way any such change is done in a public manner and the reasons, economic and otherwise, behind the proposed change are fully explained.  If Deputies consider that more information is required than initially is being provided by the Minister, then Committee Stage of the Finance Bill provides an opportunity for more detailed analysis to be made. Records of these Oireachtas proceedings are themselves subsequently published.</p><p>  Where a particularly major change is contemplated, an additional level of analysis is undertaken, frequently involving a consultation process.</p><p>  An example of such work recently conducted by my Department would be the Economic Impact Assessment of Potential Changes to Legacy Property Reliefs.  This assessment, undertaken in 2011 and published by my Department, included a consultation paper, engagement from over 700 submissions and an analysis, enabled the Department to understand the possible legacy costs to the State as well as the impacts on individuals and economic sectors of a change in law relating to the use of these particular reliefs.</p><p>  Another recent example is the Public Consultation on Section 481 Film Tax Relief.  I published a consultation paper which set out preliminary analysis and data and invited interested parties to make submissions as part of an economic impact assessment of film tax relief.  Twenty responses were received and published on my Department&#8217;s tax policy website (<i></i>), along with the results of the review. </p><p>  The impact assessment has enabled my Department to better understand the benefits that may accrue to the Exchequer as well as consequences for investors, the audiovisual industry, and the wider economy arising from changes to the relief and indeed such changes were included in Finance Bill 2013 currently before the Seanad.</p><p>  This year I announced a comprehensive review of the R&amp;D Tax Credit, which is currently being undertaken by my Department.  The terms of reference for this review have been published on the Department&#8217;s website and interested parties are encouraged to make a submission.  It is intended that the results of this review will be published in due course.</p><p>  A list of all public consultations carried out by the Tax Policy Unit of my Department can be viewed on my Department&#8217;s tax policy website.  I would add also that much of the preparatory work done by my Department in relation to tax policy options and choices generally is reflected in the papers prepared for and presented to the Tax Strategy Group.  These papers also are subsequently published on my Department&#8217;s tax policy website.</p></reply>

However based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for the year 2010, the latest year for which this information is available, and making certain assumptions about the data it is estimated that the revenue that would be raised from reducing the level at which individuals can claim interest repayments against tax for residential rental properties from 75% to 40% could be in the region of &#8364;157m.  Rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings the figures for interest are not separately distinguished in corporate tax returns.  There is, therefore, no basis on which an estimate of the cost of reducing the tax relief involved could be provided.</p><p>  The estimated cost of 2010 residential interest relief is based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.  This figure is subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</p><p>  It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system.  However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &#8364;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11.  This return is the source of the figure provided in this reply in respect of individuals.</p><p>  The level at which interest repayments can be claimed against tax for residential rental properties was reduced from 100% to 75% in section 5 of the Finance Act 2009.</p><p>  There is no specific proposal in the Programme for Government to decrease the amount of interest on borrowings that can be offset against rental income for tax purposes, however, as a matter of course all such taxation measures and reliefs are considered in the context of the budgetary process.</p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for a number of specific exemptions from the charge as well as the possibility of deferring the charge in certain cases of hardship.</p><p>  A requirement to pay management fees is not relevant in determining liability.  Accordingly, whilst those who are liable for management fees to property management companies may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific exemption for the payment of management fees.  I have no plans to introduce such an exemption.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  Liability to management fees and the scale of the fees due would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property. </p><p>  Revenue from the Local Property Tax will accrue to local authorities and will support the provision of local services.  Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm which benefit the wider community and the proper functioning of which are important for the wellbeing of every community and household.  These include fire and emergency services; road maintenance and cleaning; street lighting; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions and business support services, as well as libraries, parks, and other recreation and cultural public amenities.</p></reply>

In 2011, CMOD reached an agreement with ComReg to assign a specific block of 200,000 076 numbers to the public service, which it now manages and allocates.  Additionally, CMOD architected the Government Networks infrastructure to accept and deliver 076 numbers to anywhere in the country.  It also issued a detailed Advisory Note to public bodies explaining how 1890 LoCall numbers work and the charges associated with them, the issues this can have for mobile phone users, how the 076 number range works and how it provides cost savings for both customers and public bodies.  It advised public bodies to move to 076 numbers as soon as possible.  While both Departments use one shared LoCall 1890 number to facilitate landline calls from outside the Dublin dial-code area, it has also implemented a number of 076 numbers for use from both mobile and landlines for a range of services and units. </p></reply>

The decision taken has been not to use the IVR systems because the nature of the work does not lend itself well to an IVR-based approach.  Bodies under the aegis of my Department have provided me with the following information.</p><p><b><i>Office of the Revenue Commissioners</i></b></p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have successfully deployed a large number of interactive voice recognition (IVR) systems within their operations.  In particular, an IVR system was put in place for Revenue&#8217;s PAYE 1890 telephone service as part of a comprehensive upgrade implemented over the period 2004/2005.  The PAYE 1890 service has the highest volume of telephone contacts handled by Revenue and in 2011 some 1.23 million calls were answered on the service.  Shortly after the PAYE 1890 deployment, the Collector General&#8217;s 1890 telephone system was also re-configured with a similar IVR system to PAYE.  Some 228,000 calls were handled through the Collector General&#8217;s 1890 telephone service in 2011.</p><p>  The particular IVR system deployed by Revenue on its PAYE and Collector General&#8217;s telephone services is a very sophisticated system in that, in the first instance, a caller is asked to speak their PPS Number or Business Number into the IVR which then captures the number.  By collecting the caller&#8217;s PPS or Business Number, the call can be routed to the correct Division directly and the Revenue person handling the call is presented on their computer screen with key tax and other information about the caller at the same time that the call is passed to them to answer.  The voice capture technology behind the system is highly sophisticated as it manages to gather both the numeric and alpha characters that constitute PPS and Business Numbers within the one message string.</p><p>  I am further advised that an additional feature of this IVR system is that it facilitates a range of self-service options that the caller can use to get certain services without human intervention, including for example a facility to request the most popular PAYE forms and leaflets or, to request a statement of account in the case of a business.  In these cases, the form or statement of account requested is posted to the address associated with the PPS or Business Number that has been collected from the caller via the voice recognition system.</p><p>  I am advised that Revenue is constantly reviewing developments with regard to IVR systems and other trends in telecommunications with the objective of making the taxpayer&#8217;s experience with their telephone services as smooth and efficient as possible and, in seeking to optimise any process efficiencies.  In that regard, I understand that the various services and options available to callers that underpin the PAYE 1890 IVR system were re-vamped during 2012 and have been successfully implemented.</p><p>  In the past four to five years, IVR systems have also been implemented at telephone switch level in a number of Revenue offices around the country.  While the PPS number capture is not a feature of these facilities, they provide callers with a list of options to choose from and the call is directed to the desk of a Revenue staff member who will have the specific knowledge required to deal with the particular query.  In these offices, because calls are routed directly to staff members, a switch operator is not required to manage the flow of calls.  An IVR system has recently been deployed on Revenue&#8217;s Local Property Tax Helpline, and, as a matter of policy, Revenue will deploy IVR in its customer facing telephone systems where opportunities arise.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since their major IVR developments have been in place for a number of years, they are not in position to provide the information sought in relation to staff and salary cost savings.  However, the Commissioners are satisfied that savings have been achieved from the use of IVR systems and they have also facilitated significant process efficiencies</p><p><b><i>ReBo (Credit Union Restructuring Board)</i></b></p><p>  The Credit Union Restructuring Board have advised me that voice response systems are available on their phone systems, and that the salary costs savings have not been assessed.</p><p><b><i>National Treasury Management Agency</i></b></p><p>  The phone system currently in operation within the NTMA has the ability to provide voice activated automation.  Voice automation systems are best used where a specific and repeatable service is required e.g. information delivery.  As the NTMA does not in its day to day business activities provide these types of services it does not normally use this feature of the system.  However, the NTMA has used automated messaging as part of the Eligible Liability Guarantee (ELG) helpline established to answer queries from the public following the liquidation of IBRC and again following the Minister for Finance&#8217;s announcement of the ending of the ELG for all new liabilities from 28 March 2013. </p><p><b><i>The Financial Services Ombudsman&#8217;s Bureau</i></b></p><p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman&#8217;s Bureau do not have an integrated Voice Response System and they have no plans to install one in the near future.</p><p><b><i>Office of The Comptroller and Auditor General  </i></b></p><p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General<b></b>has not implemented such a system as it is not considered that there is sufficient need for it nor would savings arise.</p></reply>

I was very impressed by this report as I am a firm believer in the importance of projects which involve Ireland&#8217;s youth.  I would like to commend President Higgins on this wonderful initiative.  I have taken note of the nine most prominent areas of concern to young people today in this report namely: Employment, Enterprise, Social Security, Concern with Economy, Political reform, Education, Equality, Involve young people, Be positive, Health, Community and civil society, Identity as Irish.</p><p>  From a Department of Finance point of view we are actively taking steps in relation to the first issue i.e. to improve employment growth.  As the Deputy is aware Ireland&#8217;s youth unemployment rate is unacceptably high.  In an effort to reduce this figure (along with Ireland&#8217;s overall unemployment rate) we are driving cross Government initiatives as outlined in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  From my Department&#8217;s perspective, the material related to Access to Finance is of particular importance.  SME&#8217;s will be a key driver of growth and job creation across the country and access to credit and financing is essential for them to trade, to grow and to create jobs.  Through intensive engagement with SMEs and the banks we have identified a range of measures that tackle the challenges related to SME credit.</p><p>  By end 2013, new Government schemes totalling almost &#8364;2.5 billion in new lending to business will be in place: &#8364;850 million of the National Pension Reserve Fund for the SME sector, &#8364;700 million seed and venture capital scheme, &#8364;450 million credit guarantee scheme, &#8364;225 million development capital scheme, &#8364;120 million second call under Innovation Fund Ireland, &#8364;90 million microfinance scheme.</p><p>  Furthermore, the plan put in place new structures to better monitor bank lending to business: &#8364;4 billion in lending to businesses by each of the pillar banks (AIB &amp; BoI), extra staff for the Credit Review Office, which overturns over half of the bank refusal decisions which are appealed to it, more comprehensive progress reports on SME lending by banks to my Department.  I have asked one of the public interest directors in each of the pillar banks to have specific reporting responsibility on SME lending.  As part of Budget 2013, I announced a 10 point plan for SMEs which includes several measures aimed at improving their credit situation. </p><p>  Businesses also need greater choice in sourcing finance, and should be able to rely, not only on conventional loans from banks, but on other, often non-bank funding sources.  My officials are using the opportunity of the Irish Presidency to actively investigate non-bank funding sources with our European colleagues and I have put this issue on the Agenda for the informal Ecofin that will take place in Dublin in April. </p><p>  In addition to targeting improvements in credit conditions, my Department is also actively involved in assisting job growth through initiatives in the Construction, Agri-Food, Financial Services, Tourism and Aviation sectors.  All of these initiatives will support job creation and offer opportunities for young people seeking employment.</p><p>  On Thursday, 7 March, the Department of Finance published its Review of 2012.  In this review there are numerous references to initiatives which my Department has driven.  Goal 1 from our Statement of Strategy aims at providing &#8216;A resilient Irish economy founded on sustainable and balanced growth and leading to significant increases in employment numbers&#8217;.  Section 4 in the review looks solely at the measures taken in relation to this goal. </p><p><i><i><font color="#0000FF">Link to Annual Review 2012</font></i></i><i></i></p></reply>

The Deputy may also be aware that first time buyers who purchase a residential property between 1 January and 31 December 2013 are exempt from local property tax until the end of 2016.  There is also an exemption from local property tax up to the end of 2016 where a new or previously unoccupied home is purchased from a builder or developer between 1 January 2013 and 31 October 2016.  These measures should provide assistance to first time buyers following the ending of mortgage interest relief from income tax.</p><p>  Given the current fragile state of the public finances, I am not in position to introduce new supports for first time buyers.</p></reply>

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.</p><p>  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains. </p><p>  This point is reinforced in the correspondence supplied by the Deputies where it is asserted that even a target reduction of 6% to 10% in remuneration will not by itself impact significantly on losses now occurring at the covered institutions.  If appropriate action is not taken on this front in a timely manner then bank workers will be facing much more unpalatable measures than now proposed.  Tackling the cost base is of course only one of many goals that need to be achieved but combined with other measures will deliver the required results. </p><p>  I would point out in this context that redundancies at the covered institutions have been achieved to date on a voluntary basis on negotiated terms.  The effect on employee entitlements arising out of the liquidation of IBRC will serve as a sharp reminder to all sides of the fraught environment in which the banks and the country are operating </p><p>  I, and the Government, acknowledge that the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognise that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.  However, it can never be forgotten by management and employees of these banks &ndash; both past and present &ndash; that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived and that this needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.  If remuneration costs are to be reduced with the aim of a return to profitability then sacrifices at all employees levels will be required.</p></reply>

NAMA advises that the NAMA Board&rsquo;s policy is that all assets are ultimately intended for sale.  NAMA advises that it is not in the business of encouraging its debtors to stockpile assets but that actual sales depend on the level of demand in particular markets segments and on the availability of finance.  NAMA further advises that it must also seek to ensure that its debtors do not offer for sale a volume of assets in excess of the current absorption capacity of the market.</p></reply>

They also advise the NTMA with respect to issuance and assist with the marketing process as well as producing research designed to assist investors.</p><p>  The NTMA chose six of the Primary Dealers, Barclays, Danske Bank, Davy, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC and Nomura to be joint lead managers having significant roles in the new ten-year bond sale whilst the other eleven Primary Dealers were co-leads in the syndicate with lesser roles. </p><p>  The NTMA has advised that the fee payable to the syndicate of banks was 0.175% of the nominal debt issued.  This is the standard fee for the issue of bonds of a ten year maturity by syndication in the euro area sovereign bond market and is also, for example, the  fee paid by the European Investment Bank, which has a &lsquo;AAA&rsquo; credit rating, for its ten-year bond issuance.  Based on the &euro;5 billion issued, the total fee was &euro;8.75 million.  Of this amount 89 per cent is split evenly between the six joint-lead managers, with the remaining 11 per cent divided equally between the other eleven co-lead banks.  The fee represents an annualised cost of 0.02 per cent over the life of the bond.</p><p>  It is important to emphasise that the team of Primary Dealers chosen to manage the transaction assisted in building a strong order book, with some 400 investors submitting bids, including fund managers, banks, pension funds and insurance companies.  The total bids received amounted to some &euro;13 billion.  This clearly demonstrates that Ireland has regained access to the international debt markets.  The size of the order book and the broad investor interest is a strong signal of confidence in Ireland.</p></reply>

This sale was the National Treasury Management Agency&rsquo;s (NTMA) first new 10-year issuance since January 2010 when &euro;5 billion of the October 2020 bond was issued at a yield of 5.091%.  The issue yield of 4.15% represented the fair value price for a bond maturing in 2023 relative to the yields at which the existing 2020 and 2025 bonds were trading at on 13 March, that is 3.68% and 4.45% respectively.  I am advised by the NTMA that a premium was not paid relative to that fair value price.  It is normally the case that a new issue premium is required for multi-billions issues but the strong demand for this bond resulted in a zero premium. </p><p>  There was broad investor interest in the issue with some 400 investors submitting bids, including fund managers, banks, pension funds and insurance companies.  Some 18 per cent was taken up by domestic investors and 82 per cent by overseas investors.</p></reply>

Those criteria have not changed.  It is clear is that the ECB will decide on the application of OMTs in any particular circumstance to the extent that they are warranted from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is fully respected, and terminate them once their objectives are achieved or when there is non-compliance with the macroeconomic adjustment or precautionary programme.  It is also clear that the ECB's Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMTs, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  I believe the ECB&rsquo;s announcement regarding its OMT programme is a significant development and is viewed as such by the financial markets.  We are in the final year of our EU-IMF programme.  Our focus is firmly fixed on a successful and durable exit from the programme.  The recent highly successful sale of long-term bonds by the NTMA is another very significant step in this process.  We continue to assess a number of options in this regard.  However, we must respect the fact that the decision on whether to grant OMTs or otherwise in any particular case is a matter for the ECB.</p></reply>

The details of the individual IMF loan amounts are set out in table format below.  The table also provides information on the IMF loan maturities.  The Deputy should be aware that all of this information is available on the website of the National Treasury Management Agency.  The interest rate on the IMF Extended Fund Facility is tied to the IMF's market-related interest rate, known as the basic rate of charge.  As the IMF loan is provided in Special Drawing Rights, which comprise a basket of four currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY), the interest rate is constructed from three-month Eurepo, US and UK Treasury Bills and Japanese Government Discount Notes rates, plus a margin of 100 basis points.  Borrowings of up to three times a country's IMF quota are subject to the basic rate of charge.  Borrowings above three times quota attract a surcharge of 200 basis points which is in addition to the 100 basis points margin which forms part of the basic rate of charge.  This surcharge rises to 300 basis points three years after the loan size exceeds three times the quota.  At the end of February 2013, the overall blended euro equivalent interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s IMF loans was 4.17%.</p><p>IMF Loan Maturities</p><p><table><tr><th>Nominal Loan Amount (SDR = Special Drawing Rights)</th><th>Date of Drawdown</th><th>Maturity Date (Amortising)</th><th>Term from Drawdown</th></tr><tr><td>SDR 5.01 billion</td><td>18 Jan 2011</td><td>18 Jul 2015 &#8211; 18 Jan 2021</td><td>4.5 &#8211; 10 years</td></tr><tr><td>SDR 1.41 billion</td><td>18 May 2011</td><td>18 Nov 2015 &#8211; 18 May 2021</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SDR 1.32 billion</td><td>7 Sep 2011</td><td>7 Mar 2016 &#8211; 7 Sep 2021</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SDR 3.31 billion</td><td>16 Dec 2011</td><td>16 Jun 2016 &#8211; 16 Dec 2021</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SDR 2.79 billion</td><td>29 Feb 2012</td><td>31 Aug 2016 &#8211; 28 Feb 2022</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SDR 1.19 billion</td><td>15 Jun 2012</td><td>15 Dec 2016 &#8211; 15 Jun 2022</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SDR 0.76 billion</td><td>28 Sep 2012</td><td>28 Mar 2017 &#8211; 28 Sep 2022</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SDR 0.76 billion</td><td>20 Dec 2012</td><td>20 Jun 2017 &#8211; 20 Dec 2022</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>The total loan amount, as measured in Special Drawing Rights, is 16.54 billion, the euro equivalent of which is &euro;19.14 billion.

The new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.  The Central Bank is proposing to update the CCMA so it continues to provide protection to customers who co-operate with their banks while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.  The CCMA prevents a lender from requiring a principal private residence borrower in mortgage arrears to change from an existing tracker to another rate as part of any alternative repayment arrangement offered.  However, as part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s review of the CCMA, it is considering whether there is merit in allowing a lender to move a borrower in arrears off a tracker rate, where the lender has offered an alternative arrangement which is advantageous to the borrower in the long term.  The purpose of the consultation process that is under way is to gather views on such a proposal to determine if a change is required and warranted.  On the issue of advice more generally, as the Deputy is aware as part of the Government&rsquo;s mortgage advisory service which has been developed under the guidance of the Department of Social Protection, mortgage holders who have been presented with long-term mortgage resolution proposals by lenders can avail of independent one-to-one advice on those proposals.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland.  I encourage borrowers who have been offered long-term forbearance options by their lender to avail of this free service.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that, in determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the lender needs to evaluate both actual and prospective affordability for the borrower and the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility to minimise losses.  While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, some fundamental principles must be respected.  For example, the affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings.  Assumed prospective future increases in the debt servicing ability of the borrower must be credible and conservative.  Lenders need to apply a realistic valuation of the borrower&rsquo;s assets, in particular their property.  This also applies to any assumption of potential asset price appreciation, as well as the estimated costs related to a potential foreclosure of property.  Lenders need to use an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender&rsquo;s cost of funds.  The Central Bank has advised that it will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.</p></reply>

In that way, it will contribute significantly to meeting the immediate financial requirement of the EU-IMF programme.  It will be fair and progressive, with the owners of the most valuable properties paying the most property tax.  It is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property, the aim being to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  The key objective of the Government is to support the creation of jobs.  This was evident in the supports included in the Budget and in the recent Finance Bill for small and medium sized enterprises.</p><p>  As regards homeowners in distress, when introducing the Local Property Tax the Government had due regard to issues such as ability to pay.   Owner occupiers whose income is below the applicable threshold &ndash; &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple &ndash; are eligible for a full deferral of their LPT liability.  Those whose income is &euro;10,000 above these thresholds are eligible for a partial deferral of their LPT liability.  These thresholds can also be increased by 80% of any mortgage interest payable up to the end of 2017.  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  In all cases, interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum.  The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  New provisions in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provide that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for those who do not qualify for deferral of the tax, a number of different payment options have been put in place to assist people in meeting their Local Property Tax (LPT) obligations, including the facility to pay by cash.  This will allow liable persons to pay their LPT liability in full or to pay the tax for 2013 in equal instalments over the period 1 July 2013 to the end of December 2013.  Revenue's strategy in this regard is to ensure taxpayers have a choice of payment options available to them from which they can choose the method which is most suited to their individual circumstances.  I am satisfied that the provisions in the legislation with regard to deferral of liability are suitably targeted at cases of need, and that the tax itself will neither adversely impact on employment nor hinder economic growth in the economy.  Accordingly, I am not considering a postponement of the introduction of the tax at this time.</p></reply>

I share the concerns of the young people in relation to the creation of jobs. Last year, the Government published "Pathways to Work".  This will involve radical reform and restructuring of the Further Education and Training Sector and the establishment of SOLAS which is currently underway.</p><p>  In 2011, the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy was published.  The recommendations in the Strategy are currently being implemented. Last October, I published the Framework for the Junior Cycle.  When the Framework is implemented it should address many of the concerns of the young people about their junior cycle education and it should become more &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.  In the new Framework, literacy and numeracy skills are again highlighted but so too are six other skills: Managing myself; staying well; communicating; being creative; working with others and also managing information and thinking.  This approach to the learning experience of students in junior cycle should get away from the current focus on a narrow set of skills which the report criticises and it should influence practices in senior cycle.</p><p>  The Framework is underpinned by 8 Principles &ndash; including Wellbeing; Quality; Creativity and Innovation; Choice and Flexibility: Engagement and Participation; Inclusive Education; Continuity and Development and also Learning to Learn.  These  principles should be the enablers for the delivery of a broader education.</p><p>  The learning at the core of the junior cycle is described through 24 statements of learning.  These, when implemented, will respond directly to many of the comments of the young people including the need for the students to experience and value &quot;what it means to be an active citizen, with rights and responsibilities in local and wider contexts&quot; and to value &quot;local, national and international heritage, understand the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change&quot;.</p><p>  I am, over the next 7 years, phasing out the State Junior Certificate examination and replacing it with a school based approach to assessment.  The Junior Certificate is no longer, for the vast majority of students, a high stakes examination.  Instead, at the end of junior cycle, there will be a school report. It will include a School Certificate which will provide information on a student's achievement in subjects and short courses but, in addition, the School Certificate will be accompanied by an achievement profile which will provide a formal opportunity to acknowledge important achievements by students e.g in volunteering, in sport, debating.</p><p>  Irish is a very important part of my remit and I am particularly aware of the recommendations in the 20 Year Strategy for Irish.  I am committed to implementing the recommendations in the Strategy in accordance with the resources available.</p><p>  My Department along with the NCCA, SEC and HEA are examining issues relating to the transition from second level to higher education.  This is as a follow up to the recommendations of a joint conference organised by the NCCA and HEA in September 2011 and the report which emanated from their conference.</p><p>  To address issues relating to access to third level education, which were highlighted by the young people, I would like to refer to the HEA publication of January 2010 &quot;Hidden Disadvantage?  A study on the Low Participation in Higher Education by the Non- Manual Group&quot;.  The research for the report was carried out by the ESRI and its recommendations continue to inform policy.</p><p>  A mid-term review of Ireland's National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008-2013 has been carried out and identifies that, despite difficult circumstances, progress has been made in this area.  Work has now commenced on the development of the next national access plan for 2014 onwards.  A key component of the new plan will be consideration of what targets and actions are needed so that the focus will continue on increasing the participation of under-represented and disadvantaged groups in higher education.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the terms of my Department's Free Fee Initiative, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution.  The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  The Higher Education Authority (HEA) is undertaking a study on the sustainability of the current funding system for higher education.  This study was initiated at my request and an initial report has been published. This report makes it clear that immediate work is required to prepare for a longer term approach to a system that can be maintained through a sustainable funding base which will be able to address the continual expansion of the sector while protecting quality of education.  The HEA is continuing its work in this area and I will be advised further as this work progresses.  The report will help inform the decision-making as to the future funding of the sector.</p><p>  The voice and views of the partners are very important as I consider policy and the young person's voice is particularly important.  I welcome the views of students when there are school evaluations along with, for example, the views of the Irish Second-Level Students' Union.  The &quot;Being Young and Irish&quot; report provides another very important and rich perspective not only for my continued consideration but also for a wider audience.  My overall aim is to support the quality of our students' learning and  to improve their educational outcomes.</p></reply>

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or through a combination of these.  Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.</p><p>  However my Department is mindful that greater clarity would be useful for schools and parents and accordingly my Department is currently in the process of preparing a comprehensive statement of existing policy within the boundaries of one document.  Naturally the new policy statement will not be exclusive.  Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time.  Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.</p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs.  In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required.  Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children.  Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children.  Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased.  Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.</p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act.  While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.</p><p>  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.  My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.</p></reply>

The Act also requires that a school Code of Behaviour shall specify the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school, the measures that may be taken when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards and the procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school concerned.</p><p>  A school's code of behaviour must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB guidelines  make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that on 29th of January last, Minister Fitzgerald and I published the Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of these actions this year.  The Action Plan on Bullying states that children and young people who engage in bullying behaviour do not always intend to bully or recognise the potential negative impact of their words and actions on others.  Therefore, central to promoting safer and appropriate use of the  internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyber bullying incidents. Several actions in the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas.</p><p>  Work will continue on implementing the Action Plan on Bullying in the coming months.</p></reply>

These facilities and the underlying Government Networks infrastructure have been implemented resiliently.  These architectural approaches have resulted in a reduction in telecommunications costs across the Irish public service.</p></reply>

The Action Plan includes a number of measures for delivery in 2013 which are particularly targeted at young people.

This qualifying condition is applied to all applicants, regardless of their nationality.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.  The habitual residence condition (HRC), as provided for in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended), applies to claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions and guardian&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit.  A person who does not have a right to reside in the State shall not be regarded as being habitually resident in the State.  HRC does not apply to exceptional needs or urgent needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </p><p>  Each case received for a determination on HRC is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  The determination of a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is made in accordance with five factors which are set out in legislation, as follows: </p><p>(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p><p>(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p><p>(c) the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</p><p>(d) the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</p><p>(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p><p>These five factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law, and are generally sufficient to enable the deciding officer to determine whether a person&rsquo;s present circumstances in Ireland indicate a temporary visit or habitual residence. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 87,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &#8364;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  The Department funds a significant proportion of private sector rented accommodation. Accordingly, it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in any way. The purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.</p><p>  The maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013. These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market. Approximately 56,600 rent supplement claims have been awarded since January 2012, showing that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.  </p><p>The focus of the review was primarily based on ensuring an adequate level of housing stock is available, using the 40th percentile as the basis for establishing rent limits. The Department used publicly available data sources to ascertain both the market trends and the current asking prices for one, two and three bedroom properties nationally. The following data sources were used:</p><p>1. Daft.ie Rental Market Reports;</p><p>2. Leading websites advertising properties for rent;</p><p>3. CSO Rental Indices;</p><p>4. Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Databases</p><p>A snapshot of the PRTB&#8217;s database which stores all annual rental values and relevant addresses.</p><p>In County Kildare property availability at 40% of the market was examined for areas containing the main population centres (Celbridge, Kilcock, Naas,Newbridge,Clane, Kilcullen, Kildare, Maynooth, Monasterevin, Sallins and Straffan) and also for the whole county.  </p><p>When answering PQ no 117 of 5 March 2013, the number of rent supplement recipients in the main North Kildare population centres of Celbridge, Kilcock, Leixlip and Maynooth was used.  In County Kildare, there are over 4,300 recipients of rent supplement, of which over 1,000 are in these areas. </p><p>The full report of the review of maximum rent limits is available on the Department&#8217;s website at the following link: </p><p>Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement and continue to ensure that accommodation needs for recipients can be met. The next review of rent limits will take place before June 2013 and any changes to the existing limits </p></reply>

The Department has, however, been conscious of rising costs and emerging alternatives for some time and is actively planning the migration of Lo-call numbers to the 0761 range provided to us by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   Some infrastructure upgrades are required to ensure that new numbers can be accommodated on the telephone network in a seamless integration.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department is also integrating former FAS and CWS offices into its voice and data network and the new design has to take account of these changed circumstances. </p><p>  I am mindful, at all times, of the importance of the telephone to large numbers of the Department&rsquo;s customers for whom the telephone is the preferred method of communication. Any changes to long-established and well publicised numbers have to be carefully managed and announced far in advance of implementation.  I also need to ensure that stocks of published information are run down before being reprinted with new numbers.  </p><p>  The Department implemented Interactive Voice Response (IVR) solutions along with Lo-call numbers.  No staff or salary savings accrued at that time as the Locall numbers were considered to have attracted additional traffic.  There is a notional saving in that no additional telephonists were required to deal with the extra calls but an amount has never been calculated and may not be meaningful after this number of years where the higher levels of traffic are now the norm. IVRs still require a staff engagement to deal with callers who cannot navigate through the menus or take the option to go to the telephonist.</p><p>  My department is fully committed to shared services and minimising costs where possible and all related proposals are welcomed. One such initiative currently underway is with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to sharing data networks in joint locations.  My Department has not considered any proposal to share switchboard services with other bodies but is open to doing so in the future.</p></reply>

The report found that young people are understandably concerned about the prospects for graduate employment.  The transition from education to work can be very difficult for all young people.  International studies show that many young people have to face unemployment for several months, if not years, before finding their first job after leaving education. Although a period of transition is normal, a slow or difficult transition to the labour market can have a lasting impact on an individual&rsquo;s career and future income. Of particular concern is that two out of every five young unemployed people are out of work for more than one year. Difficulties in the transition to working life tend to be more acute for those who have left education with few or no qualifications.</p><p>  In this context, it is a welcome development that the most recent official labour market figures published by the CSO indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier. It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers. However, notwithstanding the recent decline, the level of youth unemployment is still unacceptably high.</p><p>  I note that the report emphasises the importance of stimulating the economy to foster jobs for young people.  Indeed, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth, and past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  However, until the economy fully recovers the Government also recognises the need for interim measures.  In this context, I am aware that feedback contained in the report suggests that young people perceive that labour market activation programmes are not for new graduates. The Government&rsquo;s main strategy for helping the unemployed into employment - Pathways to Work - has specific targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.</p><p>  This involves focusing resources on those (including young people) who are already out of work for some time, or who are clearly at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are relevant to young people. As a result, many young people, including graduates, are availing of the State&rsquo;s activation programmes. </p><p>  Long-term unemployed youth will benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person off the Live Register. Given that young people normally benefit most when employers start hiring, they are likely to be particular beneficiaries of this initiative.</p><p>  MOMENTUM, a new initiative launched in 2013, has a specific youth component. MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 jobseekers (who are unemployed for 12 months or more) to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. MOMENTUM consists of 4 themes, of which theme 4 is dedicated to under 25s. </p><p>  In addition, the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year. The qualifying period for BTEA is 3 months on the live register for second-level courses and 9 months on the live register for third-level courses.</p><p>  While these programmes focus on the longer term unemployed, assistance is also provided at earlier stages of job-search for those who have become unemployed either through losing a job or on leaving education.</p><p>  In terms of job-search assistance, some 24,500 young people registered with Employment Services in 2012, representing 35% of all registrants. About one in six of these young people seeking job-search assistance had further or higher education qualifications. In 2012, there were some 33,000 referrals of persons aged under 25 to the Department&rsquo;s activation services, affecting approximately 26,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred, 68% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year. </p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 was 2,700. These programmes may be undertaken after three months&rsquo; unsuccessful job search.</p><p>  Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012 (excluding apprenticeships and evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&rsquo; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes. Training courses relevant to the individual job-seeker&rsquo;s needs are available to all young unemployed.</p><p>  The European Commission recently proposed a Council Recommendation on a European-wide approach to a &ldquo;Youth Guarantee&rdquo;. The Council Recommendation -- which received political agreement from EU employment ministers last month -- recommends that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. In advance of the anticipated adoption of the Recommendation, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland, including measures specifically aimed at graduates, to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. </p><p>  Finally, the report refers to young people&rsquo;s perception of social welfare and the fairness of its distribution. I would note that the main measure of the fairness of social welfare transfers is the extent to which they impact on poverty, and that the Irish system performs relatively well in this regard. In 2011, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 40 per cent to 16 per cent. This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 60 per cent. Though a slight dis-improvement on the 2010 figure of 62.4 per cent, the 60 per cent figure compares very favourably with the 2005 rate of 42 per cent, an improvement of 18 percentage points.  The Irish &ldquo;poverty reduction&rdquo; rate is amongst the highest in the EU, where the average is 35 per cent; in other member states most affected by the crisis, the rate is less than 30 per cent. </p><p>  These data show the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable and should alleviate concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the social welfare system.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by this Department. The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. Expenditure on the School Meals programme in 2012 was &euro;35million.  The Government has provided an additional &euro;2 million for the programme for 2013.</p><p>  The Department is currently in the process of determining the most appropriate method of distributing the additional funding for the 2013/14 school year. Priority for funding is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education &amp; Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  The Department has written to approximately 170 DEIS schools requesting expressions of interest in participating in the scheme for the coming school year.</p><p>  On completion of this exercise, the Department will review the level of funding available to DEIS schools which are currently participating in the programme taking into account increased school enrolments.

Various renewable energy technologies are supported through REFIT, including onshore wind, hydro, landfill gas, biomass CHP, anaerobic digestion and biomass combustion and co-firing.  The lowest REFIT reference rates are offered in respect of onshore wind. </p><p>  The objective of the five part All-Island Grid Study, published in 2008, was to assess the technical feasibility and the relative costs and benefits associated with various scenarios for increased shares of electricity sourced from renewable energy in the all island power system.  As part of this study, the incorporation of large amounts of wind energy onto the grid was analysed.  It was following this study that it was decided to pursue 40% renewable electricity in Ireland by 2020.  Electricity makes up just under one-third of all energy consumed in Ireland, the rest of energy being consumed in the heating and transport sectors.  The study concluded that, based on assumptions set out in the Report, wind energy represented a cost effective source for electricity generation. </p><p>More generally, Ireland has been assigned a legally binding renewable energy target under Directive 2009/28/EC (the Renewable Energy Directive of 16% target to be achieved by 2020 across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  As already indicated 40% renewable generation of electricity is an important element of the overall 15% target.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>  Articles 6-12 of the Renewable Energy Directive provide that where a Member State falls short of its target, it will have to purchase renewable energy credits (known as &#8220;statistical transfer&#8221;) from other Member States that have exceeded their target, at an as yet, unknown price.  Accordingly, in this scenario, costs associated with renewable energy development will still be incurred, without the benefits of development. </p><p>In terms of the local communities in which wind-farming takes place, the economic benefits can potentially include construction, maintenance and component manufacturing employment. This latter opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies. There is also a potential flow of income to local economies in terms of rates, rent to land owners and local community funds.  </p></reply>

In pursuit of these objects RT&Eacute; and TG4 are charged, inter alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements, which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;.  RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act.  The extent to which the commitments entered into by our two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).</p><p>  Radio and television services, additional to those provided by the national public service broadcasters are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body.  Matters in relation to Irish music content on commercial radio are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and commercial radio operators.  In submitting their initial licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments, for instance, in regard to the playing of Irish music.  If they are successful, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of their actual licence.</p><p>  This policy approach is seen as appropriate in that it deals with the differing requirements of commercial and public service broadcasting. In relation to commercial broadcasters, it is seen as an effective means of leveraging public service type commitments that takes full account of the specific broadcaster&rsquo;s business proposal.  As for public service broadcasters, it provides an iterative approach that is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the changing needs of Irish society continue to be addressed.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of quotas, I understand that during the mid-nineties, the Regulator attempted to introduce a policy whereby 30% of music played by commercial radio stations would be by Irish artists.  The measure was deemed to be in breach of EU regulations on the grounds that it would discriminate against other European artists and would, therefore, be contrary to European law.</p><p>  Such a measure could only be supported if linked to a readily identifiable cultural criterion (Irish language, for example), as is the case in France and which would result in a much narrower application than the Deputy may have in mind.</p><p>  While I fully support the promotion of Irish music in our broadcasting services, the policy approach taken to this issue must be consistent with EU and Irish regulatory structures.  It is also important that it takes account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.</p><p>As I have previously suggested in meetings I have had with Irish music representatives, it is my view that the best approach to be followed on this issue is one of direct engagement with the radio sector with a view to establishing a mutually acceptable treatment of Irish music.  To my mind, this is likely to produce a far more successful and sustainable position in regard to the broadcasting of Irish music, rather than seeking the imposition of artificial quotas such as those being suggested by the Deputy.   </p></reply>

The proposals aim to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services for citizens and communities, to avoid overlap between the various programmes and entities that operate locally, and to ensure more sustainable arrangements for the administration costs of such programmes and entities.  More sustainable administration arrangements for the LEADER programme are important.  As noted by the European Court of Auditors, it was necessary in previous funding rounds for the State to provide additional administration funding, over and above that provided in their contracts, to some companies delivering this programme.  Accordingly, I am keen that all parties involved in the alignment between local government and local development will work together to examine the scope for administrative efficiencies and shared services.

The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance, and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its first report to Government on 11 December 2012.  Government considered the report and the working group is to continue to examine the design and implementation of measures to address the issue and will provide a further report to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>  Another measure of the Government&#8217;s waste policy is the revision of the current regulatory regime, to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that waste collection providers have Customer Charters in place.  The Customer Charters will be required clearly to set out information for customers in relation to issues such as charging structures, procedures for dealing with customers who may fall into arrears, and arrangements for switching from one waste collector to another.  I wrote to the waste management industry in September and October, 2012 in relation to the development of such charters and I understand that a number of waste collection providers have already put in place a Customer Charter ahead of the development of the new regulatory regime.  I further understand that a number of waste collection operators have notified former local authority customers of the offers and discounts available to those previously in receipt of a local authority waste collection waiver.   </p></reply>

Over the course of 2011 and 2012 output data demonstrate that almost 143,000 young people/children were engaged with through the Programme.  The LCDP is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &lsquo;harder to reach&rsquo; in the most disadvantaged areas in society and I believe the focus on supporting youth, through this and other interventions, should continue.</p></reply>

There are a number of specific recommendations in the report about the services provided by the Legal Aid Board and I will address these in my reply.</p><p>  Having regard to the significantly increased demand for services from the Legal Aid Board in recent years, it was decided to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid for 2013 at the same level as last year. The Board, in common with all public service organisations, has to manage the delivery of their services in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible having regard to ongoing pressure on the public finances. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, I have further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service is currently running a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, will be made in the coming months.</p><p>  The Board has examined its current operating environment as well as the international experience of civil legal aid services. It has also considered and examined the possible evolution of future service delivery models in order to address increasing demand for services.  This examination has led to the evolution of three central principles which will enable the organisation to deliver services in different and innovative ways that makes optimum use of the resources at the Board&rsquo;s disposal. These principles, which are fully consistent with government policy in relation to reforming our public services, are:</p><p>- to move away from a &ldquo;litigation first&rdquo; outlook to the provision of services to a more robust emphasis on alternative dispute resolution; </p><p>- a much greater engagement with the use of IT resources to improve efficiency and throughput of cases (the Board has recently introduced a new legal case management system (EOS) which is designed to improve efficiency and case throughput in law centres while also providing better management information to the Board); and</p><p>- to manage risk and performance more effectively both organisation wide and locally building on existing arrangements and ensuring a greater emphasis on compliance with procedures for quality assuring service delivery.</p><p>  The decision to transfer responsibility for the Family Mediation Service from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board has enabled the Board to take a more integrated approach to resolving family law disputes. In this connection, a review of the operation of the integrated family mediation initiative in Dolphin House in Dublin, involving the Board and the Courts Service, has resulted in a significant number of family law disputes being resolved through mediation. Such disputes would traditionally have been dealt with through litigation at greater cost to the state and often with a greater level of personal trauma for the parties involved. The Board has recently extended this approach to both Cork and Naas in cooperation with the Courts Service. I welcome the Board&rsquo;s efforts in this regard as it is fully consistent with government policy to extend the scope of mediation generally as a more cost effective means of resolving disputes that might otherwise end up before the courts.</p><p>  The Board is also in the processing of extending a &rdquo;triage service&rdquo; across its law centre network which involves providing applicants with access to a solicitor for advice within four weeks of their application for legal services being accepted. A review of the operation of a pilot &ldquo;triage service&rdquo; in five locations during 2012 demonstrated that applicants were overwhelmingly satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.</p><p>  In relation to some of the other specific recommendations in the report of the Task Force, the Board is examining the manner in which it uses private solicitors to assist with the provision of legal services with a view to ensuring that the benefits from their use are maximised within the resources available. In 2012, over 5,000 applicants for legal aid were referred to private practitioners, mainly for district court remedies. The Board has also made a proposal to my Department that no financial contribution should be payable by a person who is seeking legal services to defend proceedings on foot of the Child Care Act 1991. I am currently considering this specific matter in the context of an overall package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid. I will also have regard to the views of the Task Force in reaching a decision on this matter in due course. Under the existing regulations, the Board already has in place provisions for waiving financial contributions where not to do so would cause undue hardship to the person seeking legal services. Accordingly, this particular provision can be applied in the meantime, at the Board&rsquo;s discretion, to cases involving the defence of proceedings under the Child Care Act 1991.</p></reply>

The intention is to drive additional organisational business efficiencies and flexibilities, remove the need to purchase additional hardware and expertise in the day to day running of our telephony systems and avoid unnecessary investment and maintenance in older technologies. This will reduce both deployment and administration costs and provide additional efficiencies and cost savings into the future. In order to achieve these goals the existing communications infrastructure of the Irish Prison Service, which has sufficient call handling capacity to service the needs of my Department, is being utilised thereby leveraging existing assets and investment in the Justice sector.</p><p>  The ongoing implementation and roll-out of new technologies in the Justice sector under the auspices of the ICT Shared Services will facilitate the adoption of integrated voice response systems where required as well as numerous other features and services.  This strategy is specifically intended to facilitate the consolidation of existing switchboard and related services along the lines raised by the Deputy but the ultimate benefits will be far broader as the strategy will enable the consolidation and integration of existing diverse services. My Department has also gone to tender for the provision of telephonist and receptionist services for it and some of its agencies.  The procurement process is still ongoing and should result in further cost savings.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department has introduced an 076 number for the new Insolvency Service of Ireland rather than an 1890 number.  My Department will work with agencies on its ICT Shared Service who have existing 1890 numbers with a view to implementing a phased transition to 076 numbers.  The strategy of leveraging and further developing investment in ICT is intended to drive internal business efficiencies, including cost savings, facilitate a better service to the public and allow my Department and related agencies to take full advantage of the possibilities afforded by newer technologies.</p></reply>

In addition, the area is covered by 44 Garda CCTV Cameras which are monitored on a 24 hour basis.</p><p>  I am further informed that a plain clothes policing operation has been put in place in Amiens Street and Talbot Street environs to specifically target criminal activity and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>  Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>  I am also informed that a number of Garda Operations are being conducted in the North Inner City which actively combat anti-social behaviour and drug related criminality. These include Operation Stilts which utilises a high visibility presence to intensively police identified areas including O&rsquo;Connell Street, Marlborough Street, Talbot Street, North Earl St, Abbey St, Eden Quay, the Boardwalk, Wolfe Tone Street, Parnell Street and adjacent side streets by tackling rigorously the activities of persons involved in the commission of anti-social behaviour and drug use and dealing offences.</p><p>  The Garda authorities also engage extensively with local communities, businesses and others relevant parties with a view to addressing concerns of this nature.

There are currently remand prisoners in 11 of the 14 prisons.  This range of programmes is available across the prison estate and all prisoners, both sentenced and remand, are eligible to use the services.   On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>Remand prisoners are entitled to the same rates of daily gratuity as sentenced prisoners. There are 3 daily rates 95 cent, &euro;1.70 and &euro;2.20 depending on the behaviour and engagement of the prisoner. Prisoners who engage in certain prison work activities, e.g. kitchen, are entitled to 50 cent per half day session. There is no restriction on remand prisoners engaging in prison work activities.</p><p>In relation to Cloverhill Prison, which is the largest remand prison, given the transitory nature of the prisoners it is not practical to provide the full range of long-term programmes that is available to sentenced prisoners in other prisons. There is a small education unit which currently has an enrolment of about 110 prisoners. Work training activities are provided in the kitchen, laundry, industrial cleaning and grounds maintenance and has a capacity in excess of 40 prisoners.  Cloverhill has a dedicated forensic in-reach and court liaison service consisting of a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, Registrars and Community Mental Health Nurses. All these programmes and facilities are available to both sentenced and remand prisoners.</p></reply>

My intention is to ensure that bail law is clear on its face to all interested parties including the public, the courts and practitioners. I also believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail. </p><p>   The review is of course subject to constitutional and European Convention of Human Rights requirements in relation to the right to liberty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights  restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. </p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  </p><p>  The review includes examination of the extent to which  bail provisions can be stated in a way that emphasises the object of protection against the commission of serious offences by persons who have been charged with serious offences.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on decisions taken by a court in relation to any bail applications. It is of course open to any person who believes that he or she has been incorrectly refused bail in the District Court in respect of a minor offence to apply for bail to the High Court.</p><p>  There are no plans to develop bail supports and services in the community as part of bail reform.</p><p>  I will bring my proposals to Government in relation to new bail legislation as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.  </p></reply>

It works in partnership with other statutory and voluntary agencies including the Health Service Executive (HSE) mental health and addiction services to ensure appropriate support and treatment services are provided to Probation Service clients.</p><p>  Work is in progress between the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service to develop a strategic action plan targeted at meeting the specific needs of female offenders. These agencies are working together to develop a women centred holistic strategy that seeks to address those factors that lead some women to come in contact with the criminal justice system while also seeking to provide better outcomes for those women in respect of whom the courts deem that a custodial sanction is warranted. The strategy aims to ensure a more targeted response which takes into consideration the particular issues that pertain to female offending.</p><p>  The overall aims of the action plan will be to identify those women at risk of a custodial sentence and, through the greater use of community supports and inter-agency co-operation, to provide the necessary services that will enable the Courts to divert these women from prison in appropriate cases. The strategy further aims to improve the outcomes for those women in custody; reduce recidivism; strengthen early intervention measures through adopting a co-ordinated, multi-agency approach; and explore the potential of alternatives to custody. </p><p>  The Probation Service is also working in partnership with Dublin City Council, the HSE, the Irish Prison Service, CDVEC and non-governmental bodies to develop a strategic approach to responding to the needs of vulnerable women in Dublin. This group of women have been identified as requiring enhanced welfare, education, social and health related supports with accommodation, as part of a planned programme of intervention.  The individual organisations have examined their existing resources, services and professional skill sets with a view to reconfiguring service operations to bring about a unified response.</p><p>  Finally, in line with the recommendations in the Report of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group, a group to carry out an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy has recently been established and this group will look at this issue.</p></reply>

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service's three year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015 contains a commitment to develop a specific strategy for female offenders in conjunction with the Probation Service and other stakeholders in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors. The overall aims of the strategy for dealing with female offenders will be to identify those women at risk of a custodial sentence, and through greater use of community supports and inter-agency cooperation to provide the necessary services to further enable the Courts to consider diverting these women from prison. The strategy also aims to improve the outcomes for those women in custody; reduce recidivism; strengthen early intervention measures through adopting a coordinated, multi-agency approach and explore the potential of alternatives to custody. </p><p>  In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy. As part of that review the issue of female offenders will be examined as will the more general question of sentencing policy. I expect the Group to report later this year at which point I will further consider these matters.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><b></b></p><p><b></b>However, I can advise the Deputy that the number of females in custody at any one time is a minute fraction of the overall prison population.

Seeking to accomplish this raises a wide range of sensitivities and challenges which entails achieving an appropriate balance between security and conditions necessary for quality family visits.</p><p>  The working group has completed a detailed survey of existing visiting facilities and supports. The group will now embark on a short and targeted consultation process with various stakeholders, including relevant community representatives, in order to gain a rich understanding of the nature and quality of the visiting arrangements in each prison. It is envisaged that this consultation process will inform the group&rsquo;s approach to the detailed recommendations contained in the Irish Penal Reform Trust's : &ldquo;Picking Up the Pieces: The Rights and Needs of Children and Families Affected by Imprisonment&rdquo; Report.</p></reply>

The deputy will be aware that, on the basis of compromise texts tabled by the Irish Presidency, the Council successfully adopted a General Approach on CAP Reform by a strong qualified majority.  This has been achieved against a background of lengthy intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues, across a range of complex and sensitive issues.  </p><p>  Concluding the Council approach was not only a successful outcome for the Irish Presidency but also represents a good outcome for Irish farmers.  The key outstanding issue from an Irish perspective related to the distribution of Direct Payments within Member States.  I am very pleased that the Council endorsed the principle of flexibility that I have been seeking and agreed to the inclusion of the Irish model of partial convergence to a flat rate system in the options available for distribution of Direct Payments.  This increases the prospect of significantly lower transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat rate proposal. </p><p>  I was also pleased with the Council&rsquo;s agreement to my proposals on the greening of direct payments.  These proposals bring the necessary flexibility to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals, so that farmers can practise sustainable agriculture without overly bureaucratic impediments.  The agreement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for a greening payment to be applied as a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s single payment rather than as a flat rate.</p><p>  Another good outcome is the agreement amongst my Council colleagues to end sugar quotas in 2017. This is a good compromise as it pulls back substantially from the 2020 end date that had been demanded by many Member States.  In relation to voluntary coupled support, Ireland will have the option of using up to 7% of our national envelope for such payments.  There was also agreement to the implementation of new Areas of Natural Constraint and a change in the proposed reference year for the establishment of payment entitlements. </p><p>  This General Approach will form the basis for the next step in the negotiation process.  We will now move to the final, so-called &lsquo;trilogue&rsquo;, stage, where the Irish Presidency will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission. The successful completion of the Council&rsquo;s deliberations means that my target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains very much on schedule.  I am very hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.</p></reply>

No such treatments have been provided under the NTPF to date in 2013.</p><p>ENT Procedures</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Jul 02 - Dec 03</div></th><th><div>1,995</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2004</div></td><td><div>2,430</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2005</div></td><td><div>2,536</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2006</div></td><td><div>2,575</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>2,786</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>2,539</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>2,428</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>2,610</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011*</div></td><td><div>2,026</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>  2011**</div></td><td><div>172</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>1,674</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>23,771</div></td></tr></table></p><p>*Based on NTPF referrals Jan - July 2011 (prior to the change in the role of the NTPF)</p><p>**Based on referrals made under NTPF/SDU Programme of support (Sept - Dec 2011)</p><p>In July 2011 I announced changes to the remit of the NTPF, namely that its role would be changed to support the mission of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU).  In July 2011, the restriction that mandated 90% of the expenditure of the fund to the private sector was lifted and the referral process changed to enable the SDU and NTPF team to redirect its capability to supporting hospitals to reduce maximum waiting times.  The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times for patients.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account. The overall performance of the acute hospital system in responding to the challenge of reducing maximum waiting times was impressive during 2012, particularly when the health service has been under considerable pressure.  Whilst the most important contribution to this preliminary success has been the work of clinical and managerial leaders in individual hospitals, it must also be acknowledged that the NTPF capability in supporting the SDU has also been a contributing factor.</p><p>Statutory responsibility for the collection, collation and validation of data on waiting times and numbers of persons waiting for hospital treatment rests with the NTPF.  The NTPF collects information on hospital in-patients and day case waiting times and has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  Improving access to outpatient services, including specialist ear, nose and throat consultations, is a key priority for the Government.  For the first time outpatient waiting list data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding antibiotic medication, patients awaiting ENT consultations may require antibiotics depending on clinical indications.  Antibiotics are specific medications used to treat bacterial infections and should only be used when clinically indicated.  They do not treat viral infections.  As part of its policy to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics the Health Service Executive has developed primary care antibiotic guidelines.  These guidelines clearly indicate when antibiotics should be prescribed and include a section on ENT indications.  The guidelines have been widely distributed to General Practitioners and Primary Care Centres, are accessible using a smart phone and  available on a website provided by the HSE and RCPI Clinical Programme, working with the ICGP.  It is important that antibiotics are prescribed only when indicated, to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre monitors antibiotic use in hospitals and in the community on an on-going basis.</p></reply>

The objective is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners (GPs), nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and others.</p><p>  An allocation of &euro;20 million has been ring-fenced in the 2013 National Service Plan to enable recruitment of 250 posts to strengthen primary care services.  The posts will be filled using the Resource Allocation model, based on deprivation and need, which was developed by the HSE's National Primary Care Office and Health Intelligence Unit.  Using this model, the HSE completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of Public Health Nurses (PHNs), Registered General Nurses (RGNs), Occupational Therapists (OTs), Physiotherapists (Physios) and Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs).  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.</p><p>  Based on this analysis, it proposed that in addition to PHNs, RGNs, OTs and Physios, the following Speech and Language Therapist posts would be recruited to Primary Care Teams across the four HSE regions as follows:</p><p>  - Dublin Mid Leinster to get 22 Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs);</p><p>  - Dublin North East to get 13 SLTs;</p><p>  - The South to get 4 SLTs; and</p><p>  - The West to get 7 SLTs.</p><p>  It is my firm intention, along with the Minister for Health, to have these posts filled as soon as possible in 2013.</p><p>  As the specific issue raised by the Deputy regarding Kildare and West Wicklow is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

To introduce auto attendant facility into our current PBX system would require the purchase of additional software.  The current yearly cost to my Department for the provision oftelephonists is &euro;159,440.  Because of the high volume of calls coming into my Department a dedicated member of staffwould be required in each area to filter and redirect the calls where necessary.  The cost of additional staff would far exceed the current cost of telephonists.  In relation to the Non Commercial State Agencies under my Department's remit, responsibility for the day to day administration of these bodies lies with their governing Boards.  The Boards and management team are fully aware of the necessity to protect public funds and there are ongoing efforts to achieve savings and increase efficiencies through mechanisms such as the Public Service Agreement and through the use of new technology.  The position regarding the Health Service Executive (HSE) is a matter for themselves.  I have requested the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard.</p></reply>

The report recommends a person centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and most importantly evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.  <i>Reach Out,</i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (2005 &#8211; 2014) makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast-track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  This Government has prioritised the reform of our mental health services and is committed in particular to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community.  In this regard substantial additional funding has been provided in 2012 and 2013 primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both children&#8217;s and adult&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities.  Key initiatives progressed by the National Office for Suicide Prevention in 2012 include<b><i></i></b>the<b></b>provision of a wide range of awareness and training programmes including safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Training) which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community, the continuation of the National Awareness Campaigns which, last year, specifically targeted men and young men, the funding of partner agencies and projects and the development of the recently launched Guidance for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention developed with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p><b>  National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016:</b> The National Drugs Strategy sets out drugs policy in Ireland for the period up to 2016.  Drugs policy encompasses five pillars - supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research and clear actions are in place for implementation.  Good progress is being made across the actions of the Strategy, with the involvement of the statutory, voluntary and community sectors.  Progress continues to be reviewed through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.</p><p><b>  Suggestion to Legalise Cannabis:</b> International research shows that significant physical and mental health risks are associated with long-term cannabis use.  These include increased risks of developing lung and throat cancer (smoke from cannabis contains more carcinogenic tars than does tobacco smoke) and risks associated with the development of mental illness, such as schizophrenia and depression.  The potency of cannabis products can also vary greatly.  The 2011 NACD study <i>The potency of THC in cannabis products</i> reported the growing concern about the significant rise in the potency levels in some cannabis products over the last number of years, particularly in herbal cannabis.  Concerns have also been raised that cannabis produced in Ireland, and used relatively quickly, has a higher potency than imported varieties.  There is also evidence that cannabis plants generally are being genetically engineered to ensure they produce high levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).  Legalisation would be likely to lead to greatly increased levels of experimentation, leading to significantly increased levels of sustained long term use causing increased health problems in our society.  Indeed, the situation that pertained only a few years ago in Ireland in regard to the volume of new psychoactive substances sold in headshops illustrates this point.  People were prepared to experiment with readily available legal products, despite the publicity regarding the consequences.  Legalisation would be unlikely to significantly reduce the level of criminality surrounding the broader market in illicit drugs.  Also, if cannabis was legalised, it would most likely be strongly regulated and probably heavily priced to influence demand (as in the case of tobacco).  This in turn could lead to the continuation of an illicit market on similar lines to the black market of cigarettes.  Overall, the amount of money likely to be raised in tax would be small in relation to the health and other implications arising.  Cannabis was re-classified from a Class C drug to a Class B drug in the UK in 2009.  This decision was taken in the light of the &quot;real public concern about the potential mental health affects of cannabis use, in particular the use of stronger forms of the drug&quot;.</p><p>  Finally, any possibility of legalising cannabis has to be looked at in a European and global context.  A unilateral decision to legalise its use here would most likely lead to Ireland becoming a destination for those from other countries who wish to use cannabis.  In view of the evidence available I am not in favour of legalising the use of cannabis at this time.</p><p><b>  Disability Services: </b>The report, &quot;Being Young and Irish 2012 &#8211; Take Charge of Change&quot; from the Office of the President highlights similar issues considered by the Department's recent Value for Money and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published in July 2012.  Minister Kathleen Lynch recently approved the National Implementation Framework of the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published on the Department's website (<i>www.doh.ie</i>) on 28 February last.  The development of the Framework is one of the key actions identified in <i>Future Health,</i> the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &#8211; 2015.  It supports the message coming through from <i>Future Health</i> regarding the need to restructure service delivery, and improve organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems with the aim of providing a more effective and more accountable service.  The vision of the Disability Services Programme as set out in the VFM Review is <i>&quot;to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being&quot;.  </i>The recommendations in the Review describe how this vision is to be given tangible effect.  The National Implementation Framework determines how the recommendations from the VFM Review are translated into concrete actions.  It assigns responsibilities for those actions, and specifies time-lines for their completion.  It also identifies priorities and key performance indicators.  The Framework describes the project management and monitoring processes which are needed to make sure that the reform of the Disability Services Programme is achieved in a planned, timely and cost effective manner.</p><p>  The implementation of the recommendations in the manner set out in the National Implementation Framework will ultimately improve the lives of people with disabilities in the following ways: people with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services; services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion; the move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated; supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.</p><p><b>  Alcohol: </b>The report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy 2012 contains a number of recommendations to, inter alia, reduce the consumption of alcohol in general and are grouped under the five pillars of Supply Reduction, Prevention, Treatment, Rehabilitation and Research.  Real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the report, primarily in the areas of legislation on minimum unit pricing; access and availability of alcohol; advertising and sponsorship.  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has also considered the matter and it is intended to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.</p><p><b>  Tobacco</b>: My Department is currently developing a new tobacco policy with the aim of de-normalising tobacco smoking that will lead to a tobacco free society. There is a particular emphasis on children. It is envisaged that this will be completed by the middle of this year.</p></reply>

It may be implemented in many ways, but the essence of individualised budgeting is that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised. This approach must be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated.  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Review. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure their long-term viability.</p></reply>

This 076 number is published on my Department's Website and State Directory pages. Callers can use this number to contact my Department's three core buildings in Dublin. There are technical issues in phasing out the second 1890 Lo-Call number, which is used for the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division (DVCSD) in Shannon and is integrated with an interactive voice response system.  This system manages all public telephone enquiries to the office in Shannon and it is located outside the Government Networks. The 076 numbers can only be deployed in a site which has access to Government Networks. The interactive voice response system in place in the DVCSD will be reviewed and may be changed, subject to a resolution of the technical issues and satisfaction as to its cost effectiveness. </p></reply>

I am very mindful of the benefits which sport can bring both for the individuals who participate and for society as a whole in terms of the positive feelings which they can stimulate. It is for this reason that the Government has sought to protect, to the greatest possible extent, public funding for sports at this time of limitations on resources available to the Exchequer. For example, in recent months a scheme of sports capital grants, the first since 2008, provided funding to sporting organisations and clubs to develop their facilities, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  Hopefully from these facilities will come the next set of champions to fill communities and the country as a whole with a renewed sense of pride.</p><p>  I also note the call in the Report for reform of the education system in which I know my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, is engaged.   One aspect of these reforms in which I have a particular interest and on which I have been working with the Minister for Education and Skills is the introduction of sport as an examinable subject as part of the revised junior certificate cycle and I look forward to progress in this regard in the coming months. </p></reply>
