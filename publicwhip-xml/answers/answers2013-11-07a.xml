The Department has not yet been informed how much money will be in the SCP subhead in 2014 and consequently it is not possible at this stage to give a date for allocations. Minister Ring is due to answer a question on this later in this question session and I will defer to him on this matter.</p><p>  I understood that an allocation will be directed towards regional and local roads, specifically for road maintenance and repair. This additional investment in 2014, follows on from the &euro;50m Stimulus in 2013 and will offset the significant cut (of &euro;116m) which had been programmed for the Regional and Local Roads funding line for 2014.  It is now projected that  the overall allocation for this purpose will be &euro;334m (down from &euro;400m in 2013). </p><p>  It is already acknowledged that there will be no scope for new projects or improvements in 2014 and that while the reduction in funding will be challenging, every effort will be made to make the most of limited resources. My Department&rsquo;s grants are not - and never were - intended to cover the full maintenance cost of regional and local roads. Local authorities have other revenue sources to assist with the funding of such works.  </p><p>  It is expected that the allocation of the road capital stimulus funding for 2014 will be announced along with the normal regional and local and grant allocations early in the New Year. </p></reply>

The cut in the budget for the Irish Sports Council for 2014 currently stands at &euro;3m. It is hoped that we will be able to alleviate that somewhat through adjustments in the Department's Vote but we will have to see the details of the Council's proposals before doing so. Given the very limited resources available, we need to be satisfied that any funding that can be reallocated from other uses will deliver a very substantial additional benefit for sport.</p><p>  I would point out to the Deputy that the total Sports budget will go up from &euro;74.6m to &euro;93.5m, which is a substantial increase of over 25%. This increase will enable us to launch another round of the Sports Capital Programme and commence work on the long outstanding Indoor Arena at the National Sports Campus. This is welcome news for community sports clubs across the country and will increase participation in sport. Clubs will be able to apply for essential works like new changing rooms, pitches, lighting and other projects for the second time since this Government took office. It will also mean that we will be able to fund regional projects as happened with the last Programme. </p><p>  This increased funding for sport comes at a time when there are many calls on limited Government resources and demonstrates the Government's commitment to sport and its understanding of its value both to the economy and the health of the nation.</p></reply>

For the nine month period between January and September, the number of overseas visits to Ireland increased by 6.4% to over 5.4 million. Visits from North America were up by 14.6%; visits from Mainland Europe were up by 5.1% while visits from Great Britain were up by 3.5% for the nine month period. Due to the relatively small numbers involved, the CSO does not publish individual country breakdowns for other long-haul markets. The Office does provide an overall figure however, and the number of visits from these markets increased by 13.7% compared by the same period in 2012.     </p><p>  Tourism Ireland is the agency with responsibility for the overseas marketing of the Island of Ireland as a holiday destination.The agency continues to roll out major marketing campaigns in all of our main overseas markets and is working hard to put Ireland on the map in emerging markets. This year's activity in this regard includes arranging familiarisation visits for leading travel agents and tour operators from these markets and also cooperative campaigns with airlines and tour operators serving these regions. The Visa Waiver introduced by Government under the Jobs Initiative has assisted greatly in both facilitating more visits from those markets which are visa-required and also in encouraging operators from those markets to include Ireland in their itineraries.</p><p>  With regard to tourism strategies for the medium to longer term, Tourism Ireland  is currently finalising its three year Corporate Plan to cover the 2014 -2017 period which will, inter alia, outline strategies for each of our main overseas tourism markets.    In addition, I am currently engaged in consultations as part of my review of tourism policy, the closing date for responses to which has been extended to the 22nd November, and one of the issues raised is that of Ireland's priority markets/best prospects. </p></reply>

Earlier this year, I launched the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 which identifies a total of 144 Actions to be implemented by key stakeholders within the timeframes set.  Implementation of these Actions will lead to a further significant reduction in fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.  </p><p>  In addition to the new Strategy, I recently introduced the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill in the D&aacute;il. The Bill provides for adjustment of penalty points for certain offences, introduces a new concept of novice driver, assists the Garda&iacute; in determining the presence of intoxicants in drivers through an impairment testing system and provides for the testing for intoxicants of drivers left incapacitated by a road collision. The provisions of the Bill will also assist in making our roads safer.</p></reply>

This measure has been critical to reviving the fortunes of this sector since its introduction.  This is complemented by the reduction of the air travel tax to zero - the impact of which is already visible in terms of new services.  </p><p>  The industry will also benefit from measures such as the increase in the cash receipts threshold for VAT from &euro;1.25 million to &euro;2 million and the continuation of the diesel rebate for coach tour operators.  </p><p>  In line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, there has been a reduction on the allocation for tourism services, to &euro;123m.  The bulk of the saving in current expenditure is accounted for by the ending of once-off funding of the Gathering - some &euro;7m in 2013.  The remainder is made up of pay and programme savings as well as operational efficiencies across the tourism agencies.  Excluding this, the net reduction is some &euro;9m.  However, with the  Budget Stimulus package providing an extra &euro;8m for the Wild Atlantic Way project, the real reduction in recurring funding is equivalent to just &euro;1m.</p><p>  In the first nine months of 2013, overseas visitors to Ireland have increased by 6.4%.  The challenge for the tourism sector in 2014 will be to build on the success of this year. I am happy that the provision that is now being made for tourism services this year is sufficient to assist the sector to do just that.</p></reply>

However, the National Roads Authority has carried out preliminary work on the issue of HGV road charging. This work includes identifying the options available, given that there are a number of European Directives in this area; the international experience and trends on road user charging; and the issues that will need to be considered in an Irish context.  </p><p>  Following receipt of this report, I met with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan TD and we have agreed to establish a cross-Departmental group to consider the matter. The intention is that this group will report in the middle of next year with a recommendation on what direction to pursue based on which we will revert to Government. </p><p>  I am not seeking to pre-empt the outcome of the group, but if change to a pay-as-you-go road user charge regime is proposed, it is important to state that any changes of such a significant nature will require detailed consideration and a considerable lead in time. </p></reply>

Each Action has a target date for implementation by identified agencies and Government Departments in the period up to 2020.  </p><p>  The RSA has overall responsibility for the Strategy and I have established a Committee to oversee implementation of the Strategy with relevant Ministers, senior Department and Agency officials, and An Garda Siochana represented.  This Committee, which I chair, met as recently as last Monday. Every effort is being made to focus the attention of all road users on relevant issues including excessive speed, failure to wear seat belts and driving under the influence of intoxicants. </p><p>  The National; Roads Authority (NRA) was an active participant in developing the Road Safety Strategy and the Strategy is directly feeding into the NRA&rsquo;s work programme for next year and subsequent years. The Actions associated with the NRA include implementation of the EU Road Infrastructure Safety Management Directive on all national roads, implementation of 150 minor realignment schemes on the national road network over the lifetime of the Strategy, a reduction in the number of national access points on the road network and pavement condition improvement.</p></reply>

During that period it has also received substantial additional support from Government in a number of forms, including  &euro;392m in PSO payments, &euro;65m for capital purposes such as the enhancement of services and provision of new buses and &euro;102m to cover the cost of free travel. This comes to a total exchequer funded support of &euro;559m over that five year period.  For the years 2013 and 2014 further support of &euro;227m is being provided across these three areas.</p><p>  For the last full year we have of 2012, the total State support for Dublin Bus across the three headings for PSO, capital support and support to cover the cost of free travel was &euro;118m, a higher figure than at any time since 2008.</p><p>  Since 2008, Dublin Bus's financial performance has been severely affected by the economic recession which has resulted in a significant reduction in passenger numbers, with a total drop in journeys between the peak in 2007 and 2012 of 22% and by its failure to achieve the required level of cost savings, albeit that significant savings have been achieved. The company developed a 5 year recovery plan (2012-2016) to bring the business back to profitability. The NTA has recently granted further fare increases to the company that will be effective in 2014. The fare increase determination by the NTA assumes the achievement of the cost savings outlined in the Dublin Bus recovery plan.</p><p>  The total PSO subvention allocated to Dublin Bus by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in 2013 is &euro;65m.  In addition, the Exchequer, through the NTA, also provides funding for a rolling renewal programme for the PSO bus fleet.  The 2013 allocation for this programme in Dublin Bus is &euro;28m, resulting in the purchase of 80 new buses. A further &euro;21m will be provided to cover the cost of free travel. Bus is still the key public transport mode and it is important we have a reliable and efficient fleet with a reasonable average age.</p><p>  The total PSO subvention payable to the NTA for 2014 will be &euro;209.7m. (a reduction of &euro;16.8m. from 2013).  The allocation of the 2014 subvention, including the amount payable to the three CI&Eacute; subsidiaries, will be decided by the NTA in accordance with their PSO contracts with the companies. The CIE Group Business Plan has already factored in the expected cut in PSO subvention in 2014 and CIE has negotiated improved bank facilities in relation to refinancing of the Group.</p><p>  It should be noted that the bus services in Dublin that are not provided by Dublin Bus receive no state support and manage to cover their own costs. Also, Luas operates without operating subsidies from the tax-payer.</p></reply>

In that regard, I am pleased to report that, led by my colleague Minister Kelly, work is well advanced within the National Transport Authority on finalising proposals for the provision  of public bikes schemes in Limerick, Cork and Galway.  Significant progress has been made in relation to the award of the contract for the supply, installation, operation and maintenance of the bike schemes.  It is hoped that this contract can be awarded early in 2014 with construction to commence shortly thereafter.</p><p>  Funding  to meet the capital investment costs of public bikes in other cities has been identified within the 5-year capital allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures announced in 2012.  The delivery of the Regional Cities Bike Scheme was also dependant on  a separate process to explore the potential for a sponsorship contract to defray some of the costs associated with the introduction of the Scheme.  This process has been completed with the recent announcement that Coca Cola emerged as the successful sponsor for the Scheme.</p><p>  The vision behind the Scheme is to develop an environmentally friendly means of public transport that is healthy, relatively inexpensive and will ensure an improved quality of life in each of the city&rsquo;s natural and built environment.  Public bike schemes have the potential to enhance the city centres and provide a significant boost to the development of a cycling culture. It also adds to the tourism offering in those cities as well.</p><p>  It has been 4 years since Dublin bikes launched in Dublin city.  It has been a resounding success with over 5 million rentals since its launch and 35,000 long term subscribers.  Dublin City Council has reported a 40% increase in numbers cycling in the city over the last four years.  I look forward to hearing of similar results when the  bike schemes are up and running in Limerick, Cork and Galway.</p></reply>

There has been a positive response to the initiative from airlines so far with Ryanair and Aer Lingus Regional both announcing details of new routes and increased services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock.</p><p>  Ryanair has said it will grow its traffic at Irish airports by at least 1m passengers per annum from April 2014 in response to this initiative.  To date it has announced new routes and and additional services at Shannon and Knock which account for around 380,000 passengers of this planned 1m increase and will support in the region of 380 jobs. Aer Lingus Regional has also announced a 10% increase its flights from Cork and Dublin.</p><p>  I would like to see further announcements of this kind from these and other airlines in respect of the various Irish airports. More flights into Ireland at more locations will mean more visitors from overseas, and a bigger tourism dividend. The airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available which will help support new services and build on the success of The Gathering in the months ahead.</p></reply>

The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.    The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p><p>  The amount of public funding available for the road network has reduced significantly over the last number of years and the reality of the situation is that the amount of money available does not match the work that needs to be done. In these circumstances the NRA and local authorities have to focus primarily on the maintenance and rehabilitation of roads. </p><p>  It is worth noting however, that an additional &euro;50 million under a mini-stimulus plan was provided to local authorities in June this year for works on regional and local roads and a further &euro;50 million has been announced for next year. This funding next year means that the intended cut of &euro;116 million under the roads capital budget for 2014, will now be a smaller adjustment of &euro;66 million. This does, however, remain a very challenging reduction but every effort will be made to make the most out of the very limited resources. </p></reply>

The Report also noted that it was more difficult to identify comparable operators for Bus &Eacute;ireann given their mix of services.</p><p>  While the Deloitte Report is frequently cited as providing a Europe-wide comparison of PSO levels to bus operators, this is not the case and it is wrong to represent the study as such. The Deloitte Report compared the PSO provided to Dublin Bus to the subsidies provided to operators in Brussels, Zurich, Amsterdam, Lyon and London and in the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann, compared the PSO received by it to national operators in the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. It is unsound to draw European wide conclusions from such a limited data-set.  Despite the limitations in developing such analyses, I am advised that on the basis of recent research undertaken on behalf of the National Transport Authority (NTA), the subvention levels for operations similar to Bus &Eacute;ireann vary between 32% and 70%. This is based on a comparison of subvention levels in 4 countries, namely, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.</p><p>  If the Public Service Obligation payment is the only subsidy considered, the subvention to Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2012 was 35% of their total PSO revenues. However if the payment for the Free Travel Scheme is included, 46% of Bus &Eacute;ireann revenues are subsidised by the State. This places Bus &Eacute;ireann in the low to middle of the range of subsidy payments of those countries compared.  In the NTA's recently published economic analyis of Direct Award Bus Contract in the Dublin market, it was stated that a comparative analysis of subvention levels across Europe indicated that levels of public transport subvention vary between 35 and 60 percent of revenue. It added that when all State interventions (including the PSO subvention, Free Travel Scheme, tax foregone as a result of the Taxsaver scheme, emergency funding and funding for the purchase of new buses) are taken into account, the level of subvention to Dublin Bus is at the upper end of the range and approaches 50%.</p></reply>

The Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 provides the powers to the RSA to undertake this function.</p><p>  The RSA is currently in the process of rolling out major reforms in the testing system, which will deliver an enhanced service for the customer. Apart from safer roads for all road users, the reforms  are designed to level the competitive playing field for commercial vehicle operators by reducing non-compliance with testing and roadworthiness requirements. The new system will deliver several administrative benefits for operators, including online booking systems, reducing vehicle paperwork to be brought to the test and centralised issuing of the certificate of roadworthiness.  No increase in testing frequency has taken place as a result of the reforms. Under EU law, commercial vehicle owners are obliged to test their vehicles annually and it is an offence to use commercial vehicles on public roads without a certificate of roadworthiness (CRW).</p><p>  From 7th October last, a new annual fee, which includes a road safety levy, was introduced. The commercial vehicle reform process has been worked on since 2007 and there has not been any increase since then. The RSA consulted industry on the reforms and the planned road safety levy in November 2011 and the actual levy is lower than that proposed in the public consultation.  There have been a number of awareness raising measures of the reforms over the summer months and the new fees were advertised in national newspapers on 3rd   October 2013 and are available in full on the RSA website.  The levy is also funding enhanced supervision, enforcement and compliance measures being introduced at the roadside and at operator premises. A risk rating system is also being introduced so that roadside enforcement activity is targeted at higher risk operators ensuring that compliant operators are less likely to experience disruption to their daily business.</p></reply>

Irish Sport HQ has been completed and now is the administrative headquarters of almost 20 NGBs.    Work is almost complete on the development of multi-sport all-weather floodlit pitches.  It is anticipated that these pitches will be open to the public in December.  Work is underway on a pavilion and car park for the facility.  I officially opened the National Horse Sport Arena on 9 October and work on a new National Diving Training Centre was completed in September.  A National Modern Pentathlon Training Centre, accommodating the fencing and shooting aspects of Modern Pentathlon has been completed which, together with the existing facilities at the National Aquatic Centre and the National Horse Sport Arena, means that the National Sports Campus is one of the few facilities in Europe where training for all Pentathlon disciplines can be accommodated on one site.</p><p>  Agreements are in place among the National Sports Campus Development Authority and the FAI, GAA, IRFU and IHA to develop field-sport facilities for each of their respective sports. Preparatory works have commenced on the GAA and FAI elements.  A new access road has been completed which will open up the site for the development of these facilities.  Remaining elements of the National Sports Campus, including community pitches, high performance training and rehabilitation facilities and athlete accommodation, will continue to be developed incrementally in line with available exchequer funding.  One of the elements of the National Sports Campus that remains to be developed is a National Indoor Training Arena. The announcement in the Budget that funding will be made available from the proceeds of the sale of the National Lottery licence to allow this development to commence is very welcome news for Irish sport.This is one of the final pieces of major sporting infrastructure in Ireland and worl will commence on this next year.</p></reply>

I am keen to ensure that there is a consistency of approach in all policy areas under my Department and that the tourism and ports policy, as with the forthcoming aviation policy, are closely aligned. The broad area of where cruise tourism fits and how it can be best supported in overall tourism policy will be considered as part of the review referred to above.</p><p>  I am aware that a number of ports including Dun Laoghaire Harbour have plans in this area as part of their development Masterplans.  As the Deputy is aware, it is important to recognise that the cruise industry is not a lucrative source of revenue for port companies themselves as opposed to the economy of the hinterland. It can be difficult for investments in this area to remunerate themselves from the charges of ports levies. Being commercially state-owned enterprises, ports must fund all cruise infrastructure developments must be funded by the ports from their own resources on a commercial basis or through collaboration with those beneficiaries of cruise tourism, be they regional interests or the cruise operators themselves.</p></reply>

Our diplomatic presence in Bratislava is important in the context of shared membership of the European Union, in advancing relationships, promoting our interests and fostering goodwill between our two countries.   From an economic perspective, and given that the state agencies service the market from regional offices, the Embassy has an important role in the promotion of exports, tourism and inward investment. The Embassy performs a wide range of functions in the context of our foreign policy, including representing and advancing government policies with the Slovakian government. In addition, the Embassy delivers frontline consular and passport services to citizens, and engages with and supports the Irish community.  Since 2012, the Embassy has been staffed by only one diplomatic officer, with the rank of Ambassador, with the support of two locally engaged staff.  A breakdown of the running costs of the Embassy from 2009 to the present is set out in the table below. The figures include all expenditure items charged to Mission budgets.

Any decision to adjust the state&rsquo;s external representation, including the opening of missions, will have regard to national priorities and available resources.  At present, Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network includes 56 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices. In addition to their country of residence, several Ambassadors are accredited also to further countries on a non-residential basis which enhances the cost-effectiveness of our external representation.   The decision to close the resident Embassy to the Holy See was taken by the Government in response to economic circumstances and on the basis of an assessment as to the impact of budgetary cuts, and the need to focus our modest diplomatic network on economic recovery. In the case of the Holy See also, there are very clear requirements regarding the physical separation of Embassies to Italy and the Holy See. It is not possible for an Ambassador to be accredited to both States simultaneously, neither is it acceptable to the Holy See for them to reside at the same address. Contacts on issues of mutual interest between Ireland and the Holy See are being advanced by means of an Ambassador accredited on a non-resident basis &ndash; the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr David Cooney.    The Government will continue to review our network of diplomatic missions to ensure that it most effectively meets Ireland&rsquo;s current needs, consistent with the resources available. </p></reply>

This conference allowed excellent networking with representatives from the Northern Irish business sector. Attendance at the Conference was another example of the very good relations between the UK and Ireland which Prime Minister Cameron attested to in his address to the conference.     Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s comments on the collaborative work being undertaken between the two Governments is reinforced in the UK&rsquo;s economic package for Northern Ireland &ldquo;Building a Prosperous and United Community&rdquo; which acknowledges the need for the UK Government and NI Executive to work with the Irish Government with the aim of supporting economic growth and a shared society with equality of opportunity for all in Northern Ireland.   I spoke of this in my address to the Chamber of Commerce during my recent visit to Derry. </p><p>  At the Belfast Conference the Prime Minister also referred to the ongoing work to establish common visa arrangements across the UK and Ireland which could have significant economic benefits for business across the island.  </p><p>  My decision to involve Northern Ireland companies in the recent Global Irish Economic Forum has been heartily welcomed by those companies and by the NI business sector.

The publication of the strategy is an important acknowledgement of the ongoing blight of sectarianism across communities in Northern Ireland and recognition that building a shared society requires a comprehensive response across political, economic, civic and social life.  Building relationships between divided communities takes time and sustained effort and will need to be at the core of the work of the NI Executive, NI Party Leaders and the NI Assembly for some time to come.<i></i>The Government will continue to support all efforts by the Executive and political leaders in Northern Ireland to promote reconciliation. The priority now, in my discussions with the Parties in Northern Ireland, is to encourage and support them in implementing the Strategy to its fullest extent, both in terms of promoting an ethos of respect and reconciliation and in implementing fully the individual practical proposals as set out in the Strategy.I welcome the rapid implementation of the proposal in the strategy to establish an All-Party Group, under the independent Chairmanship of Dr. Richard Haass, to consider and make recommendations on difficult matters including parades and protests; flags, symbols, emblems and related matters; and the past.   I met with Dr. Haass on 25<sup>th</sup> September and 31<sup>st</sup>   October in Dublin and assured him that he and his team have the full support of the Government.</p><p>In my discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, with the First and deputy First Minister, and with other members of the Northern Ireland Executive, I continue to encourage all parties to seize the opportunity provided by the new Together Building a United Community Strategy and by the All-Party talks to accelerate the realisation of a cohesive and united community based on tolerance and respect in Northern Ireland.  The &lsquo;<i>Together: Building A United Community&rsquo;</i>   strategy was also discussed at the North South Ministerial Council Plenary held in Dublin on 5 July 2013.</p><p>  The EU funded PEACE and Interreg programmes have made an important contribution to supporting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and our border counties and I am glad that support for this valuable work will continue in the 2014 &ndash; 2020 period.  I am particularly pleased that during our Presidency the European Council decided to include a special allocation of &euro;150 million for a new PEACE Programme in the Multiannual Financial Framework. It is clear that the PEACE programme in particular has considerable potential to focus on the key issues of youth employment and tackling marginalisation, which are also to the fore in the &ldquo;Together Building a United Community&rdquo; strategy. </p><p>The Government will also continue to support reconciliation in other ways, including through the Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds, which provide grants to organisations involved in reconciliation work on a cross-community and cross-border basis. We will also continue to support commemorative initiatives and events in Northern Ireland which foster reconciliation and mutual understanding among the different communities on the island.<i></i>On 30<sup>th</sup>   October, I hosted a Reconciliation Networking Forum in Dublin Castle which brought together groups supported by the Funds, along with representatives of business, religions, politics and broader civil society.  This Forum considered the role of civil society fifteen years after the Good Friday Agreement and its conclusions will help to inform a new reconciliation policy that is currently being prepared by my Department.  I continue to engage with representatives of communities and wider society on issues relating to reconciliation, most recently on my visit to Derry last month.  </p></reply>

They should also include relevant documentation in support of their revised valuation such as, for example, a copy of a professional valuation as at 1 May 2013, or documented information on property sales for comparable properties in the local area or any house price survey in the area reflecting values around 1 May 2013.   In the case referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by Revenue that the person in question submitted his LPT1 Return on the 12 May 2013, which clearly indicated &lsquo;Band 2&rsquo; (valuation &euro;100,001 - &euro;150,000) as the appropriate valuation band for his property.  A payment of &euro;56 was subsequently received on 9 July 2013 equating to exactly half the &lsquo;Band 2&rsquo; amount due for 2013.  No further correspondence was received from the taxpayer in relation to the valuation submitted, nor was any further payment received. </p><p>  A letter subsequently issued from Revenue to the person in question on 18 October 2013, requesting payment of &euro;225 for 2014, based on the &lsquo;Band 2&rsquo; valuation. </p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that if the person in question wishes to amend his valuation band downwards, he should follow the steps already outlined above. Once the relevant documentation is received, LPT Branch will make direct contact with him to discuss the issue.

It is the Government&rsquo;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.   The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and the recent Credit Review Office quarterly report commented &ldquo;both banks are on track to achieve their &euro;4bn loan sanction targets, assuming the pattern of previous years of a strong Q4 performance is repeated.&rdquo;</p><p>  AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes. The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit. The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases or 55% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5M credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs. This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. </p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs.</p><p>  The range of credit options available to SMEs now include the Microenterprise Loan scheme which can facilitate up to &euro;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme is designed for SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  </p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p><p>  More generally, small businesses can benefit from support, guidance and advice provided at local level through the network of County Enterprise Boards which are currently being transformed into Local Enterprise Offices with closer links to businesses in their local area.</p></reply>

When filing her LPT Return on 15 May 2013, the person selected both &ldquo;deduction at source&rdquo; from her Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine pension and payment through a service provider.    It is acknowledged that the &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo; payment options should have been identified during the validation process that uploads the taxpayer data to the Property Register, and referred to an operator for manual correction.  Unfortunately this did not happen in this case, which resulted in the LPT Register failing to capture the preferred payment option.

I am advised that no matter how the LPT charge for 2013 was paid, property owners can choose any of the available options to pay their 2014 liability and can decide whether to pay the tax in full or to spread payments over the course of 2014.  </p><p>  Property owners can:</p><p>- Spread their payments evenly throughout 2014 by way of direct debit or deduction from salary, pension or Government payment (direct debits commence on 15 January 2014);</p><p>- Spread their payments by making regular payments, weekly or monthly, throughout 2014 at service providers listed (An Post, Payzone and Omnivend);</p><p>- Pay in full by Single Debit Authority (like a cheque) which will be debited by Revenue on 21 March 2014.</p><p>  There is no requirement on any property owner to pay their LPT for 2014 before 1 January 2014.

This process is separate from the Central Bank quarterly data collection and publication process and is intended to provide certain data on the level of mortgage restructures on a more timely basis.  It should be noted that these are voluntary and unaudited returns by the relevant banks, and have not gone through the lenders quality control process for regulatory return purposes.  However, it is considered to be a desirable development to place more timely and frequent mortgage restructuring data into the public domain.</p><p>  The data as published is the aggregate position of all the MART institutions and it would not be appropriate for my Department to publish institution specific data.  The aggregate mortgage data currently available for publication in this data series includes:</p><p>  - the number of primary dwelling mortgage accounts</p><p>  - the number of such accounts in arrears </p><p>  - the number of such accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days</p><p>  - the total number of accounts that have been subject to a permanent or temporary restructure</p><p>  - the number of accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days that have been subject to a permanent or temporary restructure</p><p>  - information on the type of permanent or temporary restructures that have been put in place.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the level and scale of action and reporting required from the banks under the MART and other regulatory requirements is increasing, and in that context, my Department will keep under review the type of data that can be collected and published in a timely manner as part of this new monthly data series.  For example, while my Department&rsquo;s mortgage data series does not give an indication of the numbers meeting the terms of the restructures put in place, it is noted that the Central Bank MART process has set targets in this area to apply from 2014.</p></reply>

This is not the case; the cost of the markers is negligible and is borne by the industry. The cost to the exchequer of marked fuel is the tax foregone and an alternative system based on direct repayments to users would not produce any savings for the exchequer and might be more costly if the incidence of fraud were greater.  There have been a number of calls for the replacement of the current marking scheme with a repayment scheme. However, a change of this nature would impact on a wide range of users, would be costly to implement and would, itself, be at risk from fraud.  Marked gas oil has a variety of uses including the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and commercial and home heating purposes.  A change to a rebate system for all users would involve the establishment of an expensive and wide-ranging repayments system and place a new administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners. It would also impose significant cash-flow costs on those currently using marked gas oil.  </p><p>  Also, repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging repayment scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.  If the fuel for off-road use was not marked under the new system then it could be diverted easily to road use; if it were marked it could be laundered as at present. It would also be the case that marked fuel from Northern Ireland would continue to be available and could be laundered by fuel criminals based in border areas.  </p><p>  The system of marking rebated fuel has been an effective and efficient means of delivering a tax rebate on a product used by a very large number of users across a wide range of uses.  Fuel laundering to remove the marker has been a persistent problem over the years. However, it remained a marginal activity because the sulphur content of marked fuel was higher than that for road fuel and therefore the sulphur content continued to distinguish laundered fuel from genuine road fuel. Environmental standards in relation to the sulphur content of fuel changed from the beginning of 2011, which resulted in marked fuel with the same sulphur content as road fuel coming onto the market. With this change, fuel laundering became more viable and criminal gangs intensified their laundering and distribution activities dramatically from the first half of 2011</p><p>  In terms of the cost to the exchequer of fuel laundering, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that estimating the extent of any illegal activity and the associated cost to the exchequer is inherently problematic. While there is no reliable estimate of the scale of the fuel laundering problem and the consequential loss to the exchequer, they recognise that it represents a significant threat to the exchequer and to the legitimate trade.  </p><p>  In response, Revenue has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action.</p><p>This strategy included strengthening the licensing conditions for auto-fuel traders in 2011 and the introduction of a new licensing system for marked fuel traders in October 2012. In addition, since January 2013, all licensed fuel traders are required to make electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions each month.  These supply chain control measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market.  Analysis of the monthly returns of fuel trading is enabling Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous fuel transactions and patterns of distribution. Traders found to be involved in suspicious activity are investigated and if they are unable to account properly for the source or disposal of product will face revocation of their license, tax assessment and prosecution, where appropriate. There is evidence that these measures are having an impact on the ability of fuel launderers to source marked diesel for laundering and to supply the laundered fuel to legitimate outlets.  <b><font color="#FF0000"> </font></b></p><p>Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud and this work has yielded significant results to date.    In the past two years 107 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions. In the period since 2011, over 2.9<font color="#FF0000"> </font>million litres of fuel have been seized and 28 oil laundries detected and closed down, including <font color="#104160">7</font> oil laundries in 2013 to date.</p><p>  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK are collaborating on identifying a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions.  A number of proposals for a new marker were received in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions and I understand that this process will be finalised shortly.  </p><p>  Revenue regularly reminds motorists and the public generally that, in addition to its impact on the exchequer and legitimate trade, they should be aware of the risks posed to their vehicles by using laundered fuel and the fact that sourcing fuel in this way is funding criminal activity.</p><p>  The legitimate retail trade can also contribute to closing down this illegitimate trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling laundered diesel.  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established Regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Retailers who suspect or have evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in their area should report this through their representative associations to the Revenue. Such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue. </p><p>  I strongly support the current strategy bring implemented by Revenue and am confident that it will succeed with the co-operation and support of the legitimate trade. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the industry has worked very closely with them in developing and implementing their strategy. </p></reply>

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available only to the primary carer of the child. A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child, as can happen with the OPFTC, is unsustainable.  </p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  </p><p>  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree. However, having listened carefully to the views expressed by colleagues and Deputies, I have asked my officials to explore how the credit could be used by another individual, where the primary carer chooses not to, or cannot, claim it and accordingly I will be bringing forward an amendment at Committee Stage.</p></reply>

I will however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%. I am doing this to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate detailed below and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. The additional levy within the existing legal framework will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  The pension fund levy imposes an annual stamp duty on the market value of assets under management in pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners under Irish tax legislation.</p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p><p>  Individuals may be affected in different ways by the pension fund levy. I am not in a position to comment on what the precise impact of the levy will be in all cases on individuals or individual funds, schemes, members or retired members as this depends, for example, on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to individual members, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for.</p><p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member&rsquo;s or class of member&rsquo;s benefits exceed the member&rsquo;s or class of member&rsquo;s share of the levy. </p></reply>

In the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, I am advised that the person concerned is not considered to be the liable person for LPT purposes because, although he is the owner of the property, he has let it for a period of more than twenty years, and therefore the lessee is the liable person. </p><p>  I am advised that Revenue amended the Property Register to reflect the lessee as the liable person.

Specifically:</p><p>- the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by the 15th of October each year;</p><p>- draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all Euro area Member States not in a programme of assistance; and</p><p>- the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by the 31st of December each year.</p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before the 15th of October from now on. Accordingly, I presented Budget 2014 on Tuesday last, 15th October. The Government also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by the 31st of December each year. One of the most critical elements of the Budget process is the accuracy of systems for forecasting potential revenue yield in the year in question prior to the Budget actually taking place.</p><p>  In the context of a December Budget Day, the availability prior to the Budget of information on cumulative tax yields to the end of November gave a high degree of certainty to the estimation of potential outturn for the year.  For example, cumulative tax yield to the end of November 2012 was &euro;33.8bn, which represented 92% of the full year outturn of &euro;36.6bn.  On the other hand, cumulative yield to end September, at &euro;26.1bn, represented only 71.3% of the eventual outturn.</p><p>  The scope for unanticipated events which would lead to either a higher or lower than projected outturn is considerably increased in the context of an October Budget. In addition the ability to project future yield is compromised. Consequently, measures which would result in improvements in the availability of information or increases in the proportion of total yield already available prior to the Budget have to be considered.  The main areas where scope exists to introduce such improvements relate to the income tax Pay &amp;amp; File arrangements and on 11th October I initiated a consultation process on a revision of the existing arrangements.</p><p>  I am aware of the concerns that have been raised and will consider the results of this consultation process, which closes on Friday next, 8th November, when drafting, as a Committee Stage amendment to the forthcoming Finance Bill, the necessary measures.  I would reiterate that changes to the Pay and File regime are necessary as a result of the move to an earlier Budget Day, following  the adoption of the Two-Pack and will provide increased certainty around the annual tax take.  I would encourage all those who hold views on the proposed changes to engage with my Department via the consultation process. Full details are available on our tax policy website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.taxpolicy.gov.ie</font></i>.</p></reply>

The person in question was linked to a second property on the basis of records imported by Revenue from another Government agency database during the development of the Property Register.  It is now evident that the person was registered with this agency to pay certain charges in relation to the second property but was not in fact the owner.  It has since been confirmed that the property belongs to the person's parents and was duplicated on the Property Register.</p><p>  I am further advised that the LPT Return which issued in March 2013 indicated to the person that he was a multiple property owner.  Revenue received no contact from the person disputing the accuracy of his records and a compliance letter subsequently issued on 29 July 2013 in respect of the second property.  The letter clearly requested that if he was not the liable owner that he immediately notify Revenue.  The letter also advised that &ldquo;deduction at source&rdquo; would commence in the absence of a response.  Revenue received no response from the person until 20 September 2013 when he telephoned to confirm that he did not own the property and that his parents were the liable persons.  Unfortunately an instruction to deduct LPT from his salary had already issued to his employer.</p><p>  On foot of the person's telephone contact, Revenue amended the Property Register and issued a revised instruction to his employer to cease deductions.  The employer subsequently confirmed that deductions had ceased from 1 October.  A refund of &euro;50.50 is due to the person and I am assured that it will issue to him in the coming days.</p><p>  Finally, Revenue has acknowledged that the linkage of the second property to the person in question during the development of the Property Register was an error. However Revenue did communicate strongly during the initial stages of LPT that errors in the compilation of the Property Register were inevitable given the scale of the task. Revenue also clearly requested anybody who received incorrect information in regard to their properties to contact the LPT Helpline immediately to avoid unnecessary compliance interventions.  Unfortunately in this instance the person delayed making contact and as a consequence compliance activity commenced.</p></reply>

Revenue has confirmed to me that LPT refunds are either made directly to the property owner or set against other outstanding tax liabilities, including LPT, if appropriate.    Revenue has also confirmed that in the case of overpayments arising from the &lsquo;deduction at source&rsquo; payment option, liable persons should not request their employers or pension providers to make LPT refunds directly to them but should instead submit claims directly to Revenue.</p><p>  By way of general comment, Section 26 of the 2012 Finance (Local Property Tax) Act (as amended) provides for a refund of LPT where a person has, in respect of a liability date, paid more than what was correctly due in error.

Among other reasons, this is because the changes are likely to have both direct impacts and indirect behavioural impacts. The direct impacts will be on individuals whose pension savings or entitlements will be in excess of the reduced SFT on 1 January 2014 (and who may seek a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT)) and those whose pension savings or entitlements may be below the threshold on that date but, with future contributions or accruals, may exceed the threshold in time. For both of these groups where the SFT or PFT is exceeded at the point of retirement, chargeable excess tax will arise. However, the changes are also likely to mean that individuals (generally in the private sector) who may otherwise be affected by the amendments to the SFT, and who have the flexibility to do so, may change behaviour and opt out of additional pension saving or pension accrual, in circumstances where they can obtain compensatory payments from their employer, in order to avoid breaching the SFT or their PFT. Overall, the changes could potentially impact, both directly and indirectly, on up to 10,000 individuals in the short to medium term.</p><p>  The changes to the SFT regime apply, as appropriate, to both defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid civil servant, a Minister or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme, the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements.</p></reply>

The yield from this measure is estimated at &euro;94 million in 2014 and &euro;127 million in a full year.  The position is that income tax relief is generally provided on contributions to private health insurance by way of the Tax Relief at Source system (TRS) at 20%, regardless of the whether the individual has an income tax liability or not.  Therefore, information on the income of insured individuals is not necessary for the administration of the granting of tax relief at source.   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a breakdown of the impact of the Budget measure by range of income could not be compiled without requiring the health insurers to provide income-based information in their annual returns, followed by carrying out a significant development of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; TRS computer system.</p></reply>

There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures. However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confining tax relief for the Public Service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20% would be in the region of &euro;480 million. This estimate includes &euro;90 million in respect of the Public Service pension related deduction.</p><p>  This estimate does not allow for possible behavioural changes that could arise from a change in the rate of relief. I should note that, as indicated in my Budget 2014 speech, contributions to pension savings will continue to attract income tax relief at the marginal rate.</p><p>  In terms of the 2010 income tax year, the latest year for which the necessary figures are available, it is estimated that about 760,000 claimants avail of income tax relief on contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts. Due to the lack of distributional data by either tax rate or by income levels as mentioned earlier it is not possible to provide reliable details of the impact of standard rating by reference to the  numbers affected or by reference to income bands.</p></reply>

Moneylenders are governed by a number of legislative obligations and supervisory requirements. Moneylenders are required to hold a licence in accordance with the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 as amended. This licence is issued by the Central Bank and must be renewed annually.    Moneylenders must also comply with the requirements of Statutory Instrument 281 of 2010 on the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010, and the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code for Licenced Moneylenders.</p><p>  The Code sets out general principles with which a moneylender must comply.  It  also places requirements on moneylenders in relation to the provision of information to the consumer, preservation of a consumer's rights, unsolicited contact (cold calling), disclosure, errors, handling complaints, consumer records, unsolicited credit facilities, arrears and guarantees, debt collection and the contents and presentation of advertisements. </p><p>  The Central Bank also monitors compliance with legislative and supervisory requirements by way of reviews, advertising monitoring, consumer intelligence and themed inspections.  </p><p>Under Common Rule 3b of the Code, prior to entering into an agreement with a consumer, a moneylender must indicate prominently the high-cost nature of the loan on all loan documentation where the APR is 23% or higher. The disclosure must take the following form &ldquo;<b>Warning: this is a high-cost loan</b>&rdquo;. The Code also places some requirements on moneylenders in relation to advertising. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i> .</p><p>  Furthermore, the annual percentage rate allowable under moneylending licences is publically stated on the public register for moneylenders. This register is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  While it should be noted that moneylender loans can be more expensive than other forms of credit, many of these loans are unique in nature. For example, they may be small value loans, over a short term and repayments may be collected at the consumer&rsquo;s home.</p><p>  The activities of illegal moneylenders are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  I would like to inform the Deputy that the Central Bank will tomorrow publish a &ldquo;Report on the Licensed Moneylending Industry&rdquo;.

These negotiations were complex, involving three operators, seven buildings, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the solicitors of the operators.  In light of these circumstances, I am satisfied that they were completed in an appropriately timely manner resulting in the continued operation of the cr&egrave;ches under a revised commercial licence.  Given that the cr&egrave;ches will be operating under a commercial licence and there is no longer any subsidy provided by the State, the fees charged by the cr&egrave;che services are strictly a commercial matter for the relevant operators, in respect of which I, as Minister for Public Expenditure, have no role.</p><p>  In relation to the issue raised concerning the period of notice given to parents, as I set out in my previous reply, since agreement on the interim licence arrangement was reached with the existing operators during the summer of 2013, the Civil Service Childcare Initiative Board and OPW have been active in ensuring that operators inform parents of the new arrangements.  My Department has been advised by the operator that in this specific case parents were informed on the 25th June 2013 of the potential for fee changes if the cr&egrave;che was successful in its negotiations with the OPW.  Parents were also advised at that time that the operator would give parents two months' notice of a change to the fees.  I also understand that there were further communications to parents on the 5th September 2013 outlining that there would be a fee increase and that parents would be given two months' notice of these increases.  The actual notification of the fee increase was issued on the 10th October to the parents advising them of the new fee structure which is proposed to take effect from 1 January, 2014.</p></reply>

In particular the uptake of the scheme was low and those awarded bonus marks were not being utilised to provide services through Irish.  The key imperative informing the new approach is, therefore, to put in place a coherent sent of measures underpinning service delivery through Irish. </p><p>  Within this overarching policy approach, Irish language proficiency policy for the civil service has been refocused to provide more meaningful and effective services through Irish.  The Departments Implementation Plan for the 20 - Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-30 includes measures aimed at building capacity in the provision of Irish language services in the civil service.  The workforce planning process will be revised to require Government Departments and Offices to identify posts and areas of work requiring functional bilinguals.  In tandem with this panels of qualified personnel who are Irish proficient will be put in place from recruitment competitions as necessary from which the identified roles can be filled.   </p><p>  Please note, the Deputy will receive a reply in Irish as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In June 2009 the then Chairman of the OPW in reply to representations from the then Ceann Comhairle, Mr John O'Donoghue, indicated that the OPW had no record of a submission from Kerry County Council in relation to the Castle and that the OPW was writing to all Councils including Kerry County Council asking them to identify their priorities in relation to coastal protection works. To date the OPW has not received an application for funding from Kerry County Council for coastal protection works at this location.   </p><p>  It is open to the Council to submit such an application under the OPW's Minor Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, if the Council considers it a priority to do so.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria for coastal protection measures, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  Application forms and related guidelines are available on the OPW website under Flood Risk Management.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-07a.295.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110700061#WRL00900"><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an invalidity pension appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 21 October 2013.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  When these have been received from the Department, the case in question will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral appeal hearing.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 15,981 at 1 November 2013.   The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  A similar trend is reflected in processing times for invalidity pension appeals. In 2010 the average processing time for an invalidity pension oral hearing was 59.7 weeks while a decision requiring a summary decision took an average of 40 weeks.  This had improved to 48.7 and 38.8 weeks respectively in 2012 and has further improved (up to October 2013) to 41.7 and 35.1 weeks respectively.  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

The Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Irish Republic will be at the centre of the programme.  In keeping with the development of an authentic programme, I anticipate that all the principal sites relating to the Rising and ensuing events will feature in the commemorations.  I am working with the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations and partners in Government to bring forward projects such as the online release of the Military Service Pensions Archive, which will provide unprecedented public access to primary source material about the Rising.</p><p>  A number of other special decade of centenary projects are in preparation, which will support research and inform discussion as we approach the centenary of the Rising in 2016.  It is my belief that the Rising can best be commemorated by placing it in the broader cultural and historical context.  In this regard, we have brought forward projects such as the <i>Century Ireland</i> initiative, in association with RT&Eacute; and Boston College, which is already charting the lives of the participants in the Rising from their first appearances in public life through to the Rising itself.</p><p>  The centenary of the founding of the Irish Volunteers will be commemorated this month.  On this point, I met a number of local historians on Monday 2 September 2013 at the County Library in Tralee to explore the possibility of arranging a lecture to commemorate the founding of the Volunteers.  It was decided to arrange a lecture to take place on Thursday 28 November at the County Library in Tralee.</p><p>  Initiatives in 2014 will include the commemoration of the founding of the Irish Citizens' Army and Cumann na mBan, and special commemorative arrangements are being prepared for these organisations.  For the comprehensive exploration of Irish life in the revolutionary period, I am keen that the programme would pay special attention to the economic and social conditions of the time.  I am very grateful for the support of the Women's' History Association of Ireland in developing the arrangements for the centenary of Cumann na mBan and the wider issues of women in society at the time, including the campaign for electoral reform.</p><p>  The arrangements to be brought forward for Easter 2016 throughout the country are under development at this time.  Clearly, the centenary of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic will be a most important anniversary and I anticipate that the special arrangements for the occasion will be of interest internationally too.  I would welcome the Deputy's views on the commemoration of the Rising and would be happy to discuss any proposals he may have.</p></reply>

In this context, energy infrastructure developers are encouraged to work with the forward planning processes at regional and local levels to set clear contexts for assessment of individual applications for planning consent and to facilitate as wide a degree of consensus as possible as to how and where to meet grid development needs.  The Government, as detailed in the July 2012 Policy Statement expects the companies in making their choices of project specific technologies and routing, as well as mitigation measures, to take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice and ensure value for money and be informed by detailed consultation at local level.  My understanding is that there is no single solution for any particular development and that technical solutions must be project specific.  I also understand that conventional overhead line is still the most common solution adopted worldwide and still offers significantly lower investment costs than any underground alternative.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on businesses at the present time.  Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013.  Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.  The reorganisation of local governance structures, set out in the <i>Action Plan for Effective Local Government &ndash; Putting People First</i> and to be given effect through the Local Government Bill 2013 currently before the House, provides an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness.</p><p>  Local authorities have a leading role in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones.  They are committed to local economic development, and are best placed to meet many of the needs of businesses, in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures.  Under the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>, the local government sector has developed a sectoral strategy, <i><i>Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs &ndash; Locally</i></i><i>,</i><b></b>to promote employment and support local enterprise, including measures in the area of business charges, local enterprise and business support arrangements, procurement support, local development and community-based initiatives, the Green Economy and participation in employment support schemes.</p><p>  As is evident from the local government sectoral strategy and the 2008 Forf&aacute;s report, the cost of running retail operations in Ireland, commercial rates, on average, account for less than 5% of overall business costs.  Notwithstanding this, I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million. </p><p>  It was therefore necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the Local Development Companies (LDCs), taking into account the level of commitments already entered into. </p><p>  The redistribution of funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible and in the case of Cavan/Monaghan LEADER the revised allocation represents a decrease of 17.5% from their original allocation.

The new governance arrangements will ensure that county council decision-making is brought closer to the local communities, without duplicate administrative or organisational overheads. In addition, as elected members will be elected for the municipal district in the first instance, this new structure will effectively eliminate duplicate representation.</p><p>  Implementation of the reorganisation process is primarily a matter for each local authority <font color="#FF0000">. </font>Advisory arrangements, involving a broad range of local government stakeholders, were established in December 2012 following the launch of the Action Programme with a view to informing, supporting and guiding the process of reform in local government structures and functions. As part of this process, a guidance framework has been provided to assist local authorities in the implementation of the reform programme in a timely and consistent manner. However, specific decisions on organisational issues, including the utilisation of their assets e.g. civic offices and the deployment of staff, arising from the implementation of the reforms remain a matter for individual local authorities having regard to local circumstances.   </p><p>  The Local Government Bill 2013 provides for the seamless transfer of functions from the local authorities that are to be dissolved to their successors, and as such the full range of local authority functions and services will continue to be delivered across each local authority area following the enactment of the legislation.</p></reply>

This legislation is kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p><p>  I have asked the members designate of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to examine, as a priority, the potential impact of section 37 of the Employment Equality Acts on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and undertake an extensive consultative process and formal assessment of the options for its amendment.  I am committed, once this necessary consultation process is completed, to bringing forward Government proposals for necessary amendments to this provision. It is not possible at this point to say when this consultation will conclude and when I will be in a position to publish my proposals.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  Under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, it is an offence, inter alia, to use words, publish or distribute written material, or broadcast any visual images or sounds which are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended, or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred.  The word &quot;hatred&quot; is defined as &quot;hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation&quot;. </p><p>  The State's prosecutorial authorities have not brought to my notice any difficulties in bringing prosecutions under the 1989 Act.  </p><p>    In addition to the above legislation, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed with a racist motive, they are prosecuted as generic offences through the wider criminal law. Judges are required to take aggravating (and mitigating) factors, including racial motivation, into account at sentencing.</p><p>  In all the circumstances, I have no plans, at present, for legislative initiatives in relation to hate crime. However, more generally, the Government is committed to a strategic review of penal policy, including sentencing. The report of the working group conducting the review is expected early next year. </p><p>  As interpretation of the Constitution is a matter for the courts, I cannot comment on Constitutional principles in this area of the law. </p></reply>

There is no provision in the Act for the automatic application of increases or decreases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to these monetary values.

These sections replaced section 13 of the Defamation Act 1961 which provided for the offence of blasphemous libel punishable by monetary and prison penalties - a term of up to 2 years imprisonment was possible. </p><p>  The provisions in sections 36 and 37 have regard to the legal advice from successive Attorneys General in the context of blasphemy, to the effect that we must address this matter as a constitutional obligation and ensure no default in compliance with the Constitution in relation to Article 40.6.1.i. Thus, in repealing the previous provision in the 1961 Act, a replacement provision was required.</p><p>  Prior to its examination by the Constitutional Convention on 3 November, this issue had previously been examined by the Constitutional Review Group in its 1996 Report, which recommended deletion of the references contained in Article 40.6.1.i. of the Constitution. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, in its July 2008 Report entitled &ldquo;<i>Article 40.6.1.i - Freedom of Expression</i>&rdquo; which dealt, <i>inter alia,</i>  with blasphemy also recommended deletion. However, the Committee saw no need for a Constitutional amendment in the short term, but rather that we might avail of any appropriate opportunity in the future. </p></reply>

This plantation was cleared of these imported ash trees by the end of October 2012.  All findings of the disease since then have been associated with imported stock up until the confirmation last month that hedgerow ash trees within and close to this formerly infected plantation tested positive for the disease.  It is likely that the disease has spread from the imported trees in the formerly infected plantation to the hedgerow.</p><p>  The quantity of firewood that has been felled as a result of this operation is currently being calculated.  Stock proof fencing is being carried out on the site where fencing has been damaged.  Repairs are being made to drains or where ground has been damaged.  Other works including reseeding of damaged patches of ground and provision of appropriate hedging trees will also be carried out.</p><p>  Whilst my Department is doing everything possible to minimise any inconvenience to landowners affected by ash dieback disease, there are no plans to introduce a compensation package. </p></reply>

IT offers a wide range of modern, online and mobile services to our customers and the online uptake of these services over the internet is steadily increasing. </p><p>  The Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) System that the Deputy refers to is developed using modern web-based technology and it holds data in relation to cattle, sheep, pigs and horses.  The information held on AIM is of critical importance in providing consumer, public health and trade assurances in relation to our farming, food and meat processing industries.  </p><p>  The AIM system is fully internet compliant and it is used online by animal tag supply companies, meat export factories, livestock marts, export assembly centres and local authority abattoirs.  The system also interacts with Farm Management packages and with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF).  AIM is also used directly online by Farmers and their authorised Agents and in the first 9 months of 2013 there were 1,951,810 calf registrations on AIM of which 855,756 (43.8% of the total) were carried out online. </p><p>  My Department also operates the Animal Health Computer System (AHCS), which is fully internet compliant and a major feature of this system is that Private Veterinary Practitioners, who carry out testing under the disease eradication schemes, are able to access and update the system over the internet.  Over 15 million individual animal tests are recorded on AHCS annually and combined with the AIM system, is critical in the operation of animal identification, movement, testing and disease control programmes.  AIM and AHCS combined allow my Department to trace animal movements in the event of a disease outbreak and the data is also used to check compliance with eligibility criteria for various schemes that my Department administers.  </p><p>In relation to the farm schemes operated by my Department, the online submission of Single Farm Payment (SFP) applications annually has been a significant feature of my Department&rsquo;s online services over the past number of years and this has proven to be very popular.  SFP online applications increased by a further 12.7% in 2013 and a total of 73,340 claims were filed online by the closing date of 15 May 2013.  This represents 56% of all SFP applicants for this year.</p><p>  I introduced a new online feature in 2012 with regard to on-line mapping whereby relevant maps can now be edited and submitted on-line with the SFP application. This is further evidence of my ongoing commitment to maximise the use of technology for the benefit of farmers. The uptake in SPS online map edits increased by 18% in 2013, with 13,959 applicants digitising map changes directly online.</p><p> This week my Department launched an online facility to enable Forestry premium recipients who have registered for online services, to apply for their 2014 forestry premium through the  portal. The development of the online Forestry premium application service, initiated originally in 2012, also allows Forestry clients to view some of their payment history and maps of their forest plantations and ultimately to receive their payments earlier then they would have using the old paper based system.</p><p>In February of this year, I also announced a new online service for 2013 Nitrates Derogation applications and plans which can be submitted on-line by farmers and their agents registered with .  This development continued my Department&rsquo;s policy of using technology to simplify procedures for farmers and also reduce the potential for application errors. </p><p>   In order to broaden the communication channels and to provide timely information to farmers using modern communication technologies, I introduced a mobile phone text messaging system recently to relay relevant information such as updates on scheme payments, deadlines, promoting new services and disease outbreak alerts.   My Department used this text messaging facility in the last few weeks to notify farmers of their interim Nitrogen and Phosphorus statement covering cattle numbers held on the farm for the 9 month period January to September 2013.  Text messages were issued to those farmers whose cattle numbers would indicate that they may be approaching or exceeding the limits set down in the Nitrates regulations.   My Department has issued over 600,000 such information text messages directly to Farmers on their mobile phones in the last 12 months.</p><p>  I also launched a mobile website () which provides better mobile access to the more popular areas of the main website. The service has been designed to work better across a range of modern mobile devices and it will automatically link into the main website when greater detail is required.</p><p>  This continuing increase in online uptake and my commitment to the rolling out of new online and mobile services underlines my dedication to improving the way we provide services to farmers.</p></reply>

This detailed analysis of the thoroughbred industry, commissioned by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders&rsquo; Association, is a very useful piece of research for anybody with an interest in the sector.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the importance of the thoroughbred sector to the Irish economy and its pre-eminent position on the world stage as a global leader in the bloodstock industry.  Indeed only last week the Irish thoroughbred sector was a key element in the major trade mission I led from Ireland to the Gulf States.</p><p>  I note that the ITBA Report estimates the industry contributed &euro;1.1bn in economic output and supported 14,000 jobs in 2012. The Report identifies challenges facing the industry and suggests a range of actions aimed at securing the future of the industry.</p><p>  The ITBA Report raises the issue of the taxation of betting and possible changes to the rate of VAT to be charged on horses. Taxation policy is solely the responsibility for the Minister for Finance who, earlier this year, introduced the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 which is aimed at updating the system of taxation applying to the betting industry.</p><p>Following from a judgement delivered by the European Court of Justice, 14th March 2013, (Case C-108/11), it was necessary for the Minister for Finance to make changes to the rate of VAT applied to horses. These changes are contained in the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013, will take effect from 1st   May 2014. However, the supply of horses intended for use in the preparation of foodstuffs or for use in agricultural production will remain at the 4.8 per cent rate. Supplies of other horses and the hiring of horses will be chargeable at the reduced rate of 9 per cent and the reduced rate of 13.5 per cent will apply to supplies of insemination services for horses. </p><p>  The ITBA Report also raises issues with regard to prize money and the importance of the establishment of overseas markets. Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), a commercial state body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and representing key sectors of the thoroughbred industry, is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry. Decisions regarding prize money fall within the remit of HRI. Irish Thoroughbred Marketing (ITM) is a subsidiary of HRI. It is funded by HRI and by the Irish bloodstock industry, including breeders, sales companies and stallion farms. ITM provides service and support to overseas visitors interested in the Irish thoroughbred racing and breeding industry. The principal focus of ITM is to generate inward investment and to increase export sales of Irish bloodstock.</p><p>  Successive Governments have recognised the importance of the horse industry for our country, and have supported it through legislation and policy initiatives.  Infrastructural supports are provided to the industry through various measures operated by my Department. This commitment to investment has enabled Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding. The Deputy is aware of my personal commitment to this indigenous Irish industry. Since becoming Minister I have taken an active interest in the industry and I commissioned an independent review of the industry in 2012.  Officials in my Department are currently preparing legislative proposals aimed at giving effect to the recommendations contained in the Indecon report on the Irish Horse Racing Industry (2012) which I plan to bring before the Cabinet for approval as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The corresponding figures for the same period last year was 3,664 million litres, representing 66% of the national quota for that year. Based on monthly quota estimates, this means that Ireland is 0.42% over quota at end September 2013 compared to a position of being 2.14% under quota at the same point last year.</p><p>Given the very favourable milk production conditions that prevailed throughout the summer and early autumn there is a strong likelihood that Ireland will exceed its quota and consequently incur a super levy fine for this milk quota year unless milk producers take corrective action for the second half of the year. I do acknowledge the frustrations of farmers wishing to expand in response to both the favourable weather conditions and the strong milk prices but I do want to remind farmers that it remains critically important that they continue to manage their enterprises within quota until the expiry of the milk quota regime on the 31st   of March 2015.  The decision has been taken at EU level that quotas will continue until this point and producers should plan their production accordingly. I would urge farmers to immediately take stock of their milk supply situation and discuss any potential over production with their Teagasc dairy advisor. I would also remind suppliers who are in, or approaching an over quota position, that they should only sell their milk through their usual purchaser in compliance with the Milk Quota Regulations and to sell through any other channels is an offence. Likewise milk purchasers have a clear obligation to only accept milk for purchase when they are absolutely certain of the provenance of that milk.</p><p>I and my officials have been extremely active in seeking to secure a soft landing for suppliers in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015 and the 2008 CAP Heath Check agreement granted Member States increased quota between 2007 and 2014 - 9.3% in Ireland&rsquo;s case.  However for a small number of countries, including Ireland, those quota increases may be insufficient to accommodate increases in milk production which have been driven by supply and demand dynamics and the prospect of a quota free production environment after 2015. I have discussed this matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers and with the European Commission, and officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level and with other Member States.  However, attempts to consider measures beyond those agreed in 2008 have been resisted and neither of the interim reports on the 2008 CAP Health Check Agreement,   in 2010 and 2012, proposed any further changes to the quota regime.</p><p>  The decision to abolish quotas from April 2015 was confirmed in the new CAP reform package as agreed under the Irish Presidency in June and efforts now must be on planning for the expansion opportunity which this provides for Ireland and as set out in the Food Harvest 2020 Strategy. In the meantime, it is clear that quotas will remain in place until their planned abolition in April 2015 and any expansion in supply before then needs to be synchronised with their abolition.</p></reply>

However, there is a requirement that the farmer must be &lsquo;active&rsquo; which, in the case of marginal type land such as mountain commonage, involves carrying out a &lsquo;minimum activity&rsquo; which is to be defined by each Member State. The European Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts setting out the framework within which MS shall define the minimum activity.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-07a.521.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013110700068#WRS02100"><p>The live export trade, whether to other EU member states or to third countries, serves a dual purpose in stimulating price competition for domestic cattle and satisfying a real demand in overseas markets. My Department and the Agencies under its aegis are committed to facilitating this trade to ensure that producers secure the highest possible sustainable price returns for Irish beef and live exports. </p><p>  Bord Bia, through its international network of overseas offices, actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity. Ireland&rsquo;s trade with Britain &ndash; the highest-priced market in Europe &ndash; remains dominated by the beef trade accounting for some 50% of our export volume and at around 250,000 tonnes is equivalent to 750,000 cattle with a high level of penetration in the multiple retail sector. </p><p>  However, the potential to grow the live trade to Britain is constrained by the labelling system operated by these retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in the UK. As the Irish-born / UK-finished proposition is seen as difficult to communicate to consumers and likely to create unnecessary labelling complications, the retailers&rsquo; long-standing policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. </p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue in its discussions with British retailers over the years, there are no indications that this policy dating from 1996 is likely to be soon reversed. Nevertheless, Bord Bia in its ongoing interactions with British customers will continue to pursue all opportunities, including through any change in labelling policies, to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.</p></reply>

In addition, the Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products was agreed at the FCTC Conference of the Parties in November 2012, and Ireland will sign and ratify that protocol.</p><p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is responsible for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products. Combating this illegal activity is a high priority for Revenue, whose work in this field has been guided in recent years by its <i>Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade 2011-2013</i>  . The intention is that a further strategy will be put in place, when the current one comes to an end, to act as the strategic focus for the ongoing extensive work against the smuggling and sale of illicit products.</p><p>  In relation to packaging, it is important to note that the Revenue Commissioners have advised that the tax stamp, which contains a range of sophisticated security features, is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged.</p></reply>

Similarly, the success of the Emerald Isle Classic college football game, which was a key part of the marketing campaign for the Gathering, is being built on with next year's game between Penn State &ndash; with the largest alumni association in the US - and the University of Central Florida in Croke Park.  </p><p>  The Gathering also made a vital contribution to the local community.

However, I am informed that the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently approved a grant of &euro;2,500,000 to Cork County Council for the development of the <i>Fortress Spike Island</i> experience.  The Fortress Spike Island project is to be developed around three principal themes &ndash; military heritage, penal heritage, and stories of enforced transportation.  These themes will allow visitors to get a real sense of the place of Spike Island in Irish history and indeed the wider history of the British Empire and the world.  These are also areas in which there is strong interest, both in Ireland and overseas, especially Great Britain.  It also resonates with the &quot;decade of centenaries&quot; which we have now entered on the island of Ireland. I am informed that the Council presented a detailed market assessment which indicates that the proposed development on Spike Island will have a broad appeal across many international tourism market segments.</p><p>  I also understand that Cork County Council placed its application for funding in the context of the Interpretive Framework for Cork City and Harbour, which was commissioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to guide the tourism development of the area.  This will place Spike Island as part of the wider effort to maximise the tourism potential of Cork and its harbour in coming years, which the tourism agencies will continue to support directly and indirectly.  I look forward to the completion of the Fortress Spike Island experience which will play a key part in the development of tourism in the Cork city and harbour area in the coming years.</p></reply>

The Wild Atlantic Way is set to be Ireland's first long-distance touring route, stretching along the Atlantic coast from Donegal to West Cork.  It is planned to develop it into an attraction of international scale, on a par with the Garden Route in South Africa or the Great Ocean Road in Australia, that will achieve greater visibility for the west coast of Ireland in overseas tourist markets.  It will be a central feature of our overseas promotion efforts through Tourism Ireland in 2014, as we bring Ireland's magnificent scenery to the world, and I understand the overseas tourist trade has already given the product a strong endorsement.</p><p>  I am informed that this funding will ensure the completion of route signage, provide for the development and enhancement of discovery points on the route as well as other infrastructural improvements.  While my Department provides the capital funding for investment in tourism product such as the Wild Atlantic Way, it is not directly involved in developing or managing such product.  The development of the Wild Atlantic Way is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I have referred the Deputy's question to the agency for further information in relation to its future development.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

There has been a positive response to the initiative from airlines so far with Ryanair and Aer Lingus Regional both announcing details of new routes and increased services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock.  Ryanair has said it will grow its traffic at Irish airports by at least one million passengers per annum from April 2014 in response to this initiative.  To date it has announced new routes and additional services at Shannon and Knock.  These account for around 380,000 of the projected one million increase and are estimated to support in the region of 380 jobs.</p><p>  Aer Lingus Regional has also announced a 10% increase its flights from Cork and Dublin.  I would like to see further announcements of this kind from those and other airlines to the various Irish airports.  More flights into Ireland at more locations will mean more visitors from overseas, and a bigger tourism dividend.  The Irish airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available which will help support new services and build on the success of The Gathering in the months ahead.</p></reply>

The continuation of the reduced rate is recognition by the Government of the importance of the tourism industry to the economy.  Together with other Budget initiatives such as the reduction in the travel tax to zero, the raising of the VAT threshold for small businesses, the capital investment in the Wild Atlantic Way and continuing measures such as the diesel rebate for coach operators, it will build on the success of the Gathering and support the increased number of jobs already in place in the sector and assist in the creation of new jobs.  I thank my colleague Minister for Finance for maintaining the rate and urge tourism businesses to fully utilise the reduced rate while it remains in place to maintain value for money and support growth and job creation.</p></reply>

The most recent published figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that there were over 5.4 million overseas visits to Ireland in the nine month period between January and September 2013 representing a 6.4% increase on the corresponding period of 2012.  All of our main target overseas markets show growth levels with the number of visits from Mainland Europe up 5.1% for the first nine months of 2013; the number of visits from Britain was up by 3.5%; the number of visits from North America was up by 14.6% for the first nine months while there was a 13.7% increase in the number of visits from other long-haul markets.</p><p>  The overall target for the year of The Gathering was to increase the number of overseas visits by 325,000 and the data suggests we are well on target to achieve this. The general response to The Gathering at home and abroad has been overwhelmingly positive.  Gatherings took place throughout the country and according to Failte Ireland, all tourism stakeholders including accommodation providers, carriers, restaurants and attractions are reporting positive results from the initiative.</p><p>  In terms of next year, overall sentiment for travel to Ireland remains good. Tourism Ireland is currently finalising its Business Plan for next year and I will be launching their 2014 Marketing Plans  in early December.  Furthermore, I am confident that measures such as the retention of the lower vat rate for tourism services, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero and the increased air access to Ireland will ensure that Irish tourism continues to grow in 2014.</p></reply>

The responses to this consultation exercise will then feed into the final policy review and statement.

The consultation process is also being progressed by means of a series of workshops which are ongoing.  This will allow consideration of the views raised and other relevant evidence and analysis before commencing drafting of the new policy in the New Year with a view to finalising it by Easter 2014.</p></reply>

In August my Department published a Regulatory Impact Analysis type consultation document regarding these proposed amendments to the Harbours Acts.  The consultation period has now concluded and my officials are considering the submissions received and have commenced preliminary work on the Heads of the Bill, which will form the basis for a round of bilateral discussions between the Department and relevant companies and local authorities in November and December.</p><p>  The new Bill will also seek to legislate for some of the new initiatives introduced in the area of corporate governance since the Government assumed office - such as the appearance of Chairmen designate before the Oireachtas committee, a stated requirement of certain board level skillsets and the establishment of a public expressions of interest system to apply for board membership.  I hope to progress the drafting of the Bills as quickly as possible and will of course, subsequent to Government approval, present the Heads to the Oireachtas committee for their opinion in due course.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in relation to the award of the contract for the supply, installation, operation and maintenance of the bike schemes.  It is hoped that this contract can be awarded early in 2014 with construction to commence shortly thereafter.  Funding to meet the capital investment costs of public bikes in other cities has been identified within the five-year capital allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures announced in 2012.</p><p>  The delivery of the Regional Cities Bike Scheme was also dependant on a separate process to explore the potential for a sponsorship contract to defray some of the costs associated with the introduction of the Scheme.  This process has been completed and I was delighted when it was announced recently that Coca Cola emerged as the successful sponsor for the Scheme.  The vision behind the Scheme is to develop an environmentally friendly means of public transport that is healthy, relatively inexpensive and will ensure an improved quality of life in each of the city&rsquo;s natural and built environment.</p><p>  Public bike schemes have the potential to enhance the city centres and provide a significant boost to the development of a cycling culture.  It has been four years since Dublin bikes launched in Dublin city.  It has been a resounding success with over 5 million rentals since its launch and 35,000 long term subscribers.  I hope to hear similar exciting results from the regional cities over the next few years.</p></reply>

I expect to see all these stakeholders renewing their efforts in marketing and promoting both the existing and the potential additional connectivity with the UK, Continental Europe, the US and other destinations.   In this regard, I strongly welcome recent announcements by both Ryanair and Aer Lingus Regional with regard to the launch of new services at a number of airports, including Cork to East Midlands and increased capacity to Birmingham and Manchester.  </p></reply>

The bulletin found that while there are no shortages of chefs in the labour market there are potential retention issues.    </p><p>  In that regard, it is worth noting that in 2012 F&aacute;ilte Ireland provided training and business support to 16,994 trainees, students and, employees and employers in the tourism sector.  In this context, 1,600 students received funding to allow them pursue Hospitality Craft and Tourism courses including Culinary Arts in the Institutes of Technology.</p><p>  In looking forward to renewed growth in the sector, consideration will have to be given to the appropriate balance of direct enterprise support, entry level training and advanced/professional training. SOLAS, employers, further and higher education providers - particularly the Education and Training Boards - and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will all have complementary roles to play in that regard.  This is an issue that has been raised as part of the ongoing tourism policy review and is being considered also in that context.</p></reply>

In that regard I have repeatedly raised the concerns of Irish hauliers with my British counterparts, unfortunately to limited effect to date.</p><p>  It should be emphasised that the cabotage provisions do not in any way affect an Irish operator&rsquo;s entitlement to carry goods between Member States &ndash; international haulage remains fully liberalised, and represents the vast bulk of haulage work carried out abroad by Irish hauliers.</p><p>  I note that in its White Paper on Road Transport 2011 to 2020 the European Commission intends to review current provisions on cabotage.  I support the idea of an open market for haulage operations and would hope that cabotage can be further liberalised.</p></reply>

The derogation expired on 31st October 2013 and I have no proposals to extend it nor to make any exceptions to the scope of the Regulations.    </p><p>  This maximum height limit was arrived at following a public consultation process undertaken in 2005. Following this, it was announced in January 2007 that a limit of 4.65m would be introduced. Originally it was proposed that there be a two year derogation for vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to the introduction of such a limit. Subsequently, following representations from the haulage industry it was agreed that a five year derogation would apply and this applies to those vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to the 1st November 2008, when Statutory Instrument 366 of 2008 was signed into effect.</p><p>  Extending this derogation would have the effect of penalising those operators who have adapted their fleet recognising that this derogation was coming to an end, and rewarding those that did not. It is more than six years since the 4.65m limit was announced and the industry has had more than adequate time to accommodate themselves to the new limit.</p></reply>

The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs across all sectors, including the tourism industry. </p><p>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the years 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and the recent Credit Review Office quarterly report commented &ldquo;both banks are on track to achieve their &euro;4bn loan sanction targets, assuming the pattern of previous years of a strong Q4 performance is repeated.&rdquo; AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes. </p><p>  I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Finance that the Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit. The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases or 55% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5m credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs. This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. </p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, was established in 2012 to develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation. F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which is among the bodies represented on the Group, promotes the sector-specific needs of the tourism and hotel industry.</p><p>  The Minister for Finance and his officials continue to engage with the lending institutions and he has met the Boards of each of the banks in which the State has a shareholding three times since the start of this year. At these meetings, he has emphasised the importance of access to credit for SMEs and the need for an adequate flow of finance to be available to viable small businesses in Ireland.</p></reply>

There is a healthy competitive market for air services in and out of the country and Ireland benefits from a wide range of air connections, both short and long haul. New routes are being announced on a regular basis by both Irish and international airlines. Irish airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available to help support new services. Maintaining and developing this connectivity is certainly a key objective of national aviation policy.    </p><p>  The new national aviation policy that is currently being developed in my Department </p><p>  will outline the actions to be taken by Government to help sustain and develop the aviation sector, in order to create jobs and support business and tourism. Ireland's two largest airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, are among the 74 stakeholders that made submissions as part of the public consultation process on the policy review that took place earlier this year.    </p><p>  The number and quality of the submissions received is encouraging and demonstrates the strong interest there is in shaping future aviation policy. The submissions are currently being reviewed and the intention is that a draft National Aviation Policy Statement will be issued before the end of the year, which will provide further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the new policy document in early 2014.    </p><p>  In relation to maximising the use of this country as an international air transport hub while the potential is not there to develop a hub on the scale of a Heathrow or Schiphol which have large populations in their hinterland and significant international connectivity. However, there have been some recent positive developments. Long haul capacity out of Ireland, particularly transatlantic capacity, has increased significantly this year and a number of new services to the US West coast and Canada will commence next year. These additional routes, together with preclearance facilities and the abolition of the air travel tax should serve to increase the attractiveness of Shannon and Dublin airports as transit hubs. </p><p>  Ref No: 47597/13 (Ans. covers questions: 47597/13, 47604/13)</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.    </p><p>  In July last year local authorities were invited to submit applications for consideration for funding in 2013 under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme.  Kerry County Council applied for funding for ten projects under this grant category but Listry Bridge was not among the Council&rsquo;s applications.   </p><p>  The Specific Improvement Grants Scheme is scheduled to be discontinued from 2014 onward in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work.  In lieu of the Specific Improvement Grant Programme, applications have been sought for minor bridge repair works (which is a subset of the current Specific Grant Programme) for 2014.  This is in line with focusing monies on road and bridge maintenance and strengthening. Kerry County Council applied for funding for four projects under this grant category and again Listry Bridge was not among the Council's applications.   </p><p>  It is also important to re-iterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Kerry County Council in their own resources spending in this area.  It is open to the Council to fund this project from its own resources.</p><p>   </p></reply>

The derogation expired on 31st October 2013.   </p><p>  This maximum height limit was decided following a public consultation process undertaken in 2005. Following this, it was announced in January 2007 that a limit of 4.65 m would be introduced. Originally it was proposed that there be a two year derogation for vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to the introduction of such a limit. Subsequently, following representations from the haulage industry it was agreed that a five year derogation would apply and this applies to those vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to the 1st November 2008, when Statutory Instrument 366 of 2008 was signed into effect.    </p><p>  Extending this derogation would have the effect of penalising those operators who have adapted their fleet recognising that this derogation was coming to an end, and rewarding those that did not. It is more than six years since the 4.65 m limit was announced and the industry has had ample time to accommodate themselves to the new limit.   </p><p>  Separately, where vehicles above the statutory limit need to be used in exceptional circumstances on the country&rsquo;s road network, the existing regime for abnormal loads will be able to deal with such requests.  This is not an alternative to complying with the legislation as it is only meant for genuine exceptions. The introduction of a wide scale permitting regime was deemed inappropriate as it would undermine the 4.65 m height limit.   </p></reply>
