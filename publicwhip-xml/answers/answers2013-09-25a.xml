This report was published on my Department's website on 15 May 2013 together with a related report from the  Professional Standards Unit in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which looked at the processes and systems which are in place to deal with the cancellation of fixed charge processing notices. </p><p>  The O'Mahoney report, which constitutes a detailed examination of the allegations, found no evidence to suggest any act of criminality, but did identify certain departures from administrative procedures.  Files in respect of three members of the Force were forwarded to the Assistant Commissioner in Internal Affairs for further investigation under the Disciplinary Regulations (the question of discipline for members is, in the first instance, a matter for the Commissioner in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations of 2007).  </p><p>  The O'Mahoney report, and the related report by the Garda Professional Standards Unit, recommended a number of changes aimed at ensuring that administrative procedures are correctly followed throughout the Force in relation to the cancellation of fixed charge notices.  In publishing the reports, I welcomed their recommendations for enhanced safeguards to ensure integrity in the Fixed Charge Processing System.  In addition, in order to provide even further public reassurance as to the effectiveness of these changes, and with the agreement of the Garda Commissioner, I asked the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to validate the proposed changes prior to implementation, including making any necessary supplementary recommendations, and to review their implementation after 18 months.  The Inspectorate is making progress in its work in this regard and I await their report.  </p><p>  I also provided the two reports to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for their consideration and for advice on any further recommendations or procedural or legislative changes which are desirable in this area.  I have also consulted with my colleague the Minster for Transport in this matter.  I am absolutely committed to the introduction of whatever improvements are necessary to ensure continuing public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the implementation of road traffic laws by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  In addition to the action I have taken above, the Garda Commissioner as a result of both reports established an implementation group to revise the Garda Policy document on the Fixed Charge Processing System and to incorporate the recommendations of both the examination and the reports in consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that a circular with revised cancellation procedures in relation to Fixed Charge Notices issued to all members of the Garda Siochana on 30 August.  This Directive may be further revised on foot of any recommendations by the Garda Inspectorate in their expected report referred to above. <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>  The following is the content of a circular that was sent.  <i>The content of the circular is available as attachment Q10.xls at the top of the web page. </i></p></reply>

There are fourteen Prison Visiting Committees in existence - one for each institution.</p><p>  I previously announced plans to strengthen the independent oversight of our prisons.  As I said then, the Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  </p><p>  A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons.  As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons which I believe will greatly enhance the Inspector's independent oversight of the prison system.  Under the proposed new arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector of Prisons.  In addition, Visiting Committees will be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time.  They will continue their role of visiting prisons.  They will also continue to meet with prisoners and liaise on their behalf with prison authorities.  I believe this will make them more effective and improve the independent oversight of our prisons.</p><p>  Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published early next year.  When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.  However, to be of assistance I have contacted the Legal Aid Board for the information requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  Demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011). </p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.    I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.</p><p>  I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.</p></reply>

I was advised by the Garda authorities that inquiries conducted into those allegations at the time found no evidence of alcohol being distributed to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by or on behalf of the company named.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  The Garda Commissioner subsequently appointed a senior officer to inquire into the matter in light of fresh allegations which had been made.   </p><p>  I am now informed by the Garda authorities that on the 19th of September this matter was referred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) under Section 85(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in the light of certain statements made during the course of that inquiry.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is an independent statutory body. It was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. The Ombudsman Commission, under the Act, is required and empowered to:</p><p>- Directly and independently investigate complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>- Investigate any matter, even where no complaint has been made, where it appears that a Garda may have committed an offence or behaved in a way that would justify disciplinary proceedings.</p><p>  In these circumstances it is a matter at present for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to decide what action they consider appropriate and members of the House will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment further on the matter at this time. </p></reply>

At that time I explained that the independent Selection Panel, which was established to carry out the selection task, had confirmed to me that it had not proved possible to recruit a Chief Commissioner at that time.  I hope to be in a position to recommence the recruitment of a Chief Commissioner shortly.  In the light of the experience gained, I consider that responsibility for the selection of Chief Commissioner and that of future Commissioners should rest with the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The PAS has existed in its different forms since the foundation of the State, to ensure integrity and impartiality in the appointment of civil servants and other public servants and is independent in the discharge of its functions and would thus fully meet the Paris Principles' requirement for a selection process independent of Government.</p><p>  The members designate of the Commission are undertaking practical work on advancing the merger on an administrative basis and on identification of the new Commission's strategic priorities.   They with the staff of both the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission are currently operating in a cohesive manner in this transition period.  An example of this work is their preparation, at my request, of a detailed staffing needs assessment for the new Commission.  This submission is currently being examined in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am of course conscious of the current difficult economic climate.  However, notwithstanding these difficulties I remain committed to doing everything I possibly can to ensure that the Commission has the resources in place to carry out its mandate fully. </p></reply>

The ISI has advised that, in the interest of confidentiality, it does not intend to make public details or breakdowns of the number of applications received or being processed at this time. I am further advised that the ISI fully intends to provide quarterly statistics once a statistically meaningful number of applications have been processed.</p><p>  As I originally indicated in the course of the passage of the Personal Insolvency legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas, provisional estimates of the number of applications in one full year of operation of the three new debt relief solutions are 15,000 for Debt Settlement Arrangements and Personal Insolvency Arrangements and 4,000 to 5,000 Debt Relief Notices.</p><p>  I understand that the first Debt Relief Notice will issue within the next month as will the first Protective Certificate that will cover those applying for a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. As the Deputy will be aware, Debt Settlement Arrangements and Personal Insolvency Arrangements are conducted in a two stage process. The Protective Certificate at stage one offers a 70 day window for Practitioners to develop a proposal to the satisfaction of the debtor and creditors. This should mean that the first Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement will issue later this year - approximately 70 days after the first Protective Certificate is issued. It is important to note that as soon as the Protective Certificate issues, debtors are protected from any action that creditors, subject to the Protective Certificate, may be inclined to take.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.  However, to be of assistance I have contacted the Legal Aid Board for the information requested by the Deputy.  I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that priority is given to applicants seeking legal services in certain categories of cases which include domestic violence.  </p><p>  The Board have advised me that, in relation to domestic violence cases, an applicant on making contact with a law centre or with the Board's office at Dolphin House in Dublin (where the District Family Court sits), is requested to complete an application form which includes details of their finances.  The applicant must satisfy a means test and be found to be financially eligible under the provisions of the Act and Regulations. If they are eligible, they are either offered an appointment with a solicitor in a law centre or, as is almost invariably the case in Dublin, they are granted a legal aid certificate enabling them to retain a private solicitor from the Board's panel to represent them.  The applicant is asked to pay the financial contribution however, an application may be made on their behalf to reduce or waive the contribution if they are unable to pay it. </p><p>  If they are getting an appointment with a solicitor in a law centre they will be given an appointment at the earliest opportunity. This may be a matter of days. Should they be issued with a legal aid certificate enabling them to retain a private solicitor from the Board's panel they will be given a list of the solicitors who are on the panel for the particular county.  In the event of an applicant experiencing difficulty finding a solicitor to take the case the law centre or Dolphin House office may assist them in doing so.</p></reply>

It is difficult to predict with any certainty the exact number of Garda members who will retire by the end of the year. The Deputy will recall that under the terms of the arrangements his party entered into in November 2010 when in Government the number in the Garda force was to be reduced to 13,350 by 31 December 2012. At that date there were in fact 13,424 Garda members. I have managed to maintain members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a higher level than previously agreed by the Deputy's party in Government.</p><p>  Garda strength at any one time is influenced by a number of factors, including in particular the rate of retirement and the rate of attestation of Garda trainees, and it would be speculative to predict the precise Garda strength at the end of 2014 or 2015.  As the Deputy is aware, however, I have secured the approval of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for a recruitment competition for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are a number of procedural issues that need to be finalised prior to the formal commencement of that competition and these are expected to conclude in the coming weeks with the first students entering the Garda College in Templemore, Co Tipperary, in mid-2014.</p></reply>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to work closely with local communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of measures, including the Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert Schemes, and the new Garda Text Alert Scheme.</p><p>  There are over 1,400 local Community Alert groups around the country administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re in close co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A new Garda Community Crime Prevention Programmes booklet has been published to support the establishment and operation of Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and similar local crime prevention initiatives.</p><p>  In addition, a new Garda Text Alert Scheme was launched yesterday by the Garda Commissioner.  This scheme, which has been piloted in a number of locations, was developed through close cooperation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Muintir na T&iacute;re, Neighbourhood Watch, the Irish Farmers Association and related stakeholders.   It provides a further mechanism by which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can provide crime prevention information to community groups, who in turn will forward this information and advice by text or email to all members of the group in the community.<b></b>  I understand that these arrangements were very well received during the pilot phase of the project.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also run community clinics as local initiatives at District and Sub-District level to provide basic Garda services to meet local needs.  They are usually operated by community Garda&iacute; in community centres, local halls, schools or shopping centres.  Clinics can operate to deliver a stand alone function, such as supporting a particular campaign, or as part of a wider theme, such as the Community Alert scheme.  I have asked the Commissioner for the latest information on the number of community schemes and clinics, and I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it is to hand.</p></reply>

This includes the disclosure of such information to parents. Currently, this is done on an administrative basis but, subject to Government approval, I intend to put these arrangements on a statutory footing. </p><p>  Our primary objective has to be to minimise the risk posed to the public. The High Level Group which produced and published a discussion document on sex offenders was of the view that, if the Gardai have reason to believe a particular high risk sex offender poses a real and immediate danger, they should be free to tell individuals who need to know.  Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable. </p><p>  However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders' register would be likely to be counter-productive.  That kind of access would drive offenders underground and make it more difficult to monitor and supervise them.  This was the universal view of those who responded to the discussion document and participated in the public forum on the management of sex offenders. </p><p>  General access to the register would also raise issues concerning the rights of persons who have completed their sentences and pose no future threat to society. </p><p>  My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences.  Arising from the review, l expect to seek Government approval for legislative proposals, including amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to provide a statutory basis for necessary disclosure, shortly.</p></reply>

Legislative proposals being considered include measures for the electronic monitoring of sex offenders in specific circumstances. </p><p>  Part 10 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 provides for the introduction of electronic monitoring and the relevant order commencing the provisions in the context of a restriction of movement condition applying to the granting of temporary release was made in 2010.  Currently, the Irish Prison Service has a contract with a service provider for the provision of electronic monitoring.  This is used mainly for the monitoring of hospital in-patients who have been granted temporary release from prison and allows for a significant reduction in staffing costs for hospital escorts. </p><p>  I have no further plans for the introduction of electronic monitoring at this time.  However, electronic monitoring is being examined by the working group conducting an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy.  I expect the group to report later this year. </p></reply>

The eligibility period for an annual programme extends for a year and a half after the end of the year in question.  </p><p>  For the programme years 2008 to 2010 (which is the latest for which final figures have been compiled), Ireland was allocated &euro;4,855,918 under the ERF, of which &euro;3,012,960 was spent.  Under the EIF, for the programme years 2007 to 2010 - the EIF started a year earlier than the other Fund, we were allocated &euro;3,829,055, of which &euro;2,232,706 was spent.  The remainder of the allocations was unspent due to an insufficiency of suitable projects with the required level of matching funding.  In line with what is stated in the preceding paragraph, the eligibility periods for those programme years have expired.</p><p>  Our allocations for the 2011 programme year were &euro;2,010,662 in respect of the ERF and &euro;1,344,054 for the EIF.  Under the relevant rules, the final report for 2011 is due to be submitted to the Commission next March and work is under way on this.</p><p>  The allocations for the 2012 and 2013 programme years total &euro;2,400,158 for the ERF and &euro;3,071,831 for the EIF.  Pobal, on behalf of my Department, conducted a call for applications under both Funds with a closing date of 20 September last.  Projects selected under this call will be charged to these allocations as, in the case of the 2012 programme year, will some expenditure of projects selected following a call for applications in late 2009 / early 2010. </p><p>  I should caution, however, that expenditure in any given calendar year will depend on the amount in the relevant subhead of my Department's Vote, in accordance with the normal method of implementing EU funding here.  Also, regard must be had to the desirability of commencing the new Asylum and Migration Fund, which will succeed the ERF and EIF, at an early date when all the necessary arrangements are in place.</p><p>  The selection criteria in respect of both Funds in the recent call for applications are, in brief: capacity of the applicant; need for the project; outcomes for the target group; strategic fit; and value for money.

As the Deputy is probably aware, both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions.</p><p>  In contrast with the current system which is entirely paper based, the new arrangements will, among other things, provide for personal interviews at first instance with the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the right to an oral appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.

The Garda Ombudsman Commission has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  The 2005 Act also provides for protocols on the sharing of information between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Ombudsman Commission. Protocols were agreed in 2007 and set down time limits for the provision of information by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Garda Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>  The Garda Ombudsman Commission, however, raised concerns in their 2012 Annual Report regarding delays in concluding their investigations, and in particular delays in receiving requested information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Concerns regarding Garda response times were also raised by the Garda Ombudsman Commission in the context of their later public interest report which dealt with the handling of covert human intelligence sources by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In response to these concerns I convened a meeting  with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Garda Ombudsman Commission on 23 July last to discuss the need for enhanced co-operation between the two bodies so as to ensure the effective and efficient investigation of allegations of Garda misconduct.</p><p>  Both the Commissioner and the Chairperson agreed on the need for the highest possible level of co-operation between the two organisations, and emphasised that the protocols which deal with the sharing of information and time frames for responses were at that point under review. I am please to confirm that revised protocols have now been agreed and were signed by the Chairperson of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner on the 23rd September 2013.  These revised protocols put in place clear procedures for the timely sharing of information and more generally for enhanced co-operation, and I look forward to their implementation.</p><p>  I should also say that, to facilitate early engagement in relation to any future emerging issues, I have established a committee chaired by a senior official in my Department, with senior representatives from the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to act as a forum where any such issues can be identified and appropriately addressed.  As regards the case for additional powers, the Ombudsman as I say already has extensive powers, including full police powers of investigation.  I am, however, currently examining suggestions by the Ombudsman Commission for changes to the 2005 Act aimed at enhancing the process of investigating complaints, and I will bring forward proposals for any change which I believe is necessary.</p></reply>

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.</p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.   The Deputy may be aware that the ISIS committee are providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues and a number of seminars have also been held.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review which will examine all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies and alternatives to custody. I expect the Group to report later this year and I intend to publish that report.</p></reply>

I would like to remind the house that Travellers in Ireland have the same civil and political rights as other citizens under the Constitution. The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected. The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.<b></b>All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers.</p></reply>

This is necessitated by the urgent need to make savings in Government expenditure across many programmes. The Scheme is being phased out on this gradual basis in order to give affected organisations as much time as possible to adjust to the change and to consider alternative methods of charitable fundraising.  The planned timeframe for winding down the Scheme is as follows. In 2012, the total amount of assistance disbursed under the Scheme was &euro;6 million. In 2013 this will reduce to &euro;4 million, in 2014 to &euro;2 million, and in 2015 - the final year of the Scheme - to &euro;1 million.</p><p>  All payments under the Scheme are of course subject in the usual way to availability of funding on an annual basis, receipt of satisfactory applications from eligible organisations, and compliance by beneficiaries with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  Provision for an increase in the prize fund limits applicable to private charitable lotteries is included in the National Lottery Act 2013 which is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is the intention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to commence this provision shortly. This will update the total prize fund limit for lotteries held under section 27 of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act from &pound;3,000, where it has stood since 1987, to &euro;5,000. For lotteries held under section 28 of the 1956 Act, the limit will increase from &euro;20,000 (set in 2002) to &euro;30,000.</p><p>  Separately, in July 2013, the Government approved the General Scheme of a Gambling Control Bill, which will update our laws on gambling, and will involve the repeal of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  This legislation will cover lotteries, but will exclude the National Lottery.  The General Scheme, which is available on my Department's website, sets out the proposed increases in prize fund limits for lotteries that fall within the remit of this proposed legislation.  The General Scheme has been referred to the Attorney General's Office for formal legal drafting.  It is anticipated that this will be a lengthy process, given the complexities of the issues involved.</p></reply>

Ministers were formally consulted on and involved in agreeing the Government's position on this issue.</p><p>  In our democratic State, budgetary decisions are for the democratically-elected Government of the day to make and for the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to approve.

This is reflected in the national strategy document which sets out strategies already in place for the Traveller Community in the areas of Education, Accommodation, Healthcare and Employment. It also mentions initiatives in place in the same areas to assist the Roma community who are citizens of the European Economic Area and are legally resident in the country.</p><p>  As a first step towards a national strategy, the State brought together all of the initiatives that already exist across Government so as to include them in a national strategy document. It is important to note, however, that the strategy is envisaged to be a living document and, as time goes on, there is nothing to prevent the development and inclusion of any new actions in any of the sectors.  It should be noted that Traveller representatives are active participants on National Committees dealing with policy in the areas of Education, Health and Accommodation, in addition to the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee and, in this way, are involved in the development of policy.</p><p>  My Department is currently collating reports on progress achieved in relation to Traveller actions which are in the National Traveller/Roma Integration Strategy with a view to reporting on progress to the EU Commission . I am aware of the recent evaluation by the EU of all the National Traveller/Roma Integration Strategies and the results in relation to Ireland are not how I would like them to be. In this context I have asked my Department to consider the existing mechanisms for consultation,implementation, monitoring and review of the National Strategy with a view to recommending any necessary changes.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p><p>  A suspended sentence imposed by the District Court is appealable to the Circuit Court. In such instances the District Court would normally, or on request, fix recognisances in the event of an Appeal. Once the appellant has lodged an original of the Notice of Appeal, together with a statutory declaration as to service and entered into a recognisance as fixed by the Court the suspended sentence is stayed pending determination of the Appeal by the Circuit Court. Where an appeal is to the Court of Criminal Appeal there are established procedures in place for applications for priority to be made to the judge having management of the List and the basis for any such application could include an assertion that the term of the suspended sentence is likely to have expired before the hearing. The Courts Service has indicated that an appeal by a convicted person against a suspended sentence is rare except perhaps where the terms of the suspension are deemed to be too onerous.  An appeal against conviction might be brought in a case where a suspended sentence was imposed but where the suspended sentence is of itself not the subject of an appeal. In addition, the imposition of a suspended sentence can be the basis of an undue leniency application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). There are  currently 154 cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal list awaiting hearing; sixteen of these are undue leniency applications by the DPP and four of those applications concern sentences where sentence was suspended.</p><p>  The President of the Circuit Court is determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and has been working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times. It should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of Circuit Court sittings in venues outside Dublin. This has increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters as well as dealing with District Court Appeals. With the increase in capacity assigned to date in 2013, significant progress has been achieved in reducing waiting times across the Circuit Court.</p><p>  The Service has indicated that waiting times in the Court of Criminal Appeal vary depending on the category of the case. As already mentioned,  priority applications may be made to the court and the judge will decide such applications on a range of competing priorities. I am informed that the Chief Justice, in consultation with the President of the High Court, has convened 9 additional sittings during September and the first week of October to deal with sentence appeals and undue leniency applications. A total of 55 such cases have been allocated hearing dates comprising 36 sentence appeals and 19 undue leniency applications.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy,  I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service is continually reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country, a specific objective of which is to ensure that the Service, in the current environment, can continue to maintain the delivery of frontline court services and the maintenance of an appropriate level of service to court users. It is in this context that the Service keeps the number of court venues it maintains under continuous review with no court venue being singled out or exempt from the review process. During the course of 2012  the Service completed a comprehensive review of all venues throughout the country. The purpose of this review was to establish a framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking account of a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc. The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that in July 2013, the Board announced the closure of eight venues which are due to close on or before 1 January 2014 - Ballyhaunis, Baltinglass, Birr, Clones, Edenderry, Kells, Kinsale, Swinford. The Courts Service has informed me that further venues have been identified for consideration for closure, detailed assessments have been completed in respect of four venues and they are currently under consideration.  The Courts Service has again assured me that no decision in relation to the future of any courthouse will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users. Such consultation has already begun and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.</p></reply>

This notification period applies whether the person is resident in the State or was convicted of a relevant offence in another jurisdiction and subsequently enters the State.  Furthermore, a person who is subject to the notification requirements of the Act who intends to leave the State for a continuous period of 7 days or more must notify the Garda&iacute; of that intention and, if known, the address of the place outside the State where he or she intends to reside or stay.  Return to the State must be notified within the same time frame.  When the Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised via Interpol.</p><p>  In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish and British Governments on the sharing of information on sex offenders between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and British police forces, including the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), is in place since 2006 and an Agreement for Sharing of Personal Data in relation to the Investigation of Sexual Offences and the Monitoring of Sex Offenders between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was signed in 2008.

The perceived advantage of a separate authority is that it interposes an additional layer of independent accountability between the political process and the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Where there is a single national police force, the case for the setting up of a policing authority to act as a link between democratic institutions and the day to day responsibility for operational policing loses much of its force.  This additional layer would dilute democratic accountability and political responsibility.  The relationship between the Garda Commissioner, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas has developed over time.  The accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the House, both directly and through the Minister for Justice and Equality, has been strengthened by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p><p>  The separate roles of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner in relation to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided for under the provisions of the 2005 Act.  The Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Force, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.  In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, as well as the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.  The accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has, through these measures, been significantly strengthened.</p><p>  Another point overlooked by those who advocate a separate authority is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not only the police service in this jurisdiction, it is the security and intelligence service and border control authority of the State.  To pass control of such matters to an unelected body beyond the executive and the legislature would clearly be problematical.  It is more appropriate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be accountable to the Government and to the Oireachtas - which are fully representative of, and dependent upon the support of the sovereign authority of, the Irish people.</p></reply>

A number of task forces are already in existence which serve to target cross border organised criminal activity including the Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling and the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group.</p><p>  Through the work of these task forces, successful actions continue to be taken against those involved in such forms of crime with criminal groups, operating in both jurisdictions, having been identified and disrupted, with them being specifically targeted for investigation by all the enforcement agencies concerned.</p><p>  Further to this a Cross Border Threat Assessment is updated for law enforcement purposes and is published biennially in conjunction with the Cross Border Seminar on Organised Crime. The Assessment is important in aiding law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border to identify emerging trends in cross border criminality, and serves to highlight issues of immediate concern. </p><p>  Specifically with regard to tackling any terrorist threat, the counter-terrorism strategies and intelligence-led operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in cooperation with its partners in Northern Ireland, are focused on targeting and disrupting any operational planning or logistical support being conducted or contemplated in this jurisdiction. </p><p>  In tandem with this ongoing co-operation taking place at operational level, I meet and maintain regular contact with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to address matters of mutual concern and enhance effective co-operation and co-ordination on all criminal justice matters.  </p><p>  Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters we operate a structured framework to further develop this co-operation. In this regard the two Justice Departments, the police authorities and the public prosecutors North and South have also jointly developed and put in place a Joint Manual of Guidance for use in criminal investigations with a cross-border element.</p><p>  All of the above are important elements in enabling the two police forces to work more effectively together in tackling criminality in the border area and in promoting community safety for all communities on this island.</p></reply>

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presidents monitor waiting times across all courts lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. </p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum. </p><p>  I am informed that waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases.  The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times. In relation to the Circuit Court, it should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of sittings in venues outside Dublin. This increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  In addition, six specialist judges of the Circuit Court were appointed in July to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. The President of the District Court is also concentrating judicial resources in the areas of greatest need. </p><p>  In relation to the High Court, the Courts Service has indicated that there are 4,422 cases listed and awaiting trial in the various lists. High Court waiting times are generally in the range of 2 to 5 months except in relation to Asylum cases where the delay is currently 2 years. The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives including the reorganisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses.  In addition the delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has also increased judicial availability for trial work.  These initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded.  As indicated above, with the exception of the Asylum List, waiting times in the High Court have been maintained at low levels.  I am informed that delays in the Asylum list are due to several factors including the high volume of cases. Delays in lists also occur where parties who have certified the case as ready to proceed and/or applied for a hearing date inform the court that they are not ready to proceed on the allocated date and apply for adjournment.</p><p>  The Service has indicated that the waiting time in the Central Criminal Court is in the region of 12 months. I am also advised that waiting times in the Court of Criminal Appeal vary depending on the category of the case and there are 154 cases awaiting a hearing at present.  I understand that the Chief Justice, in consultation with the President of the High Court, has convened 9 additional sittings during September and the first week of October to deal with sentence appeals/undue leniency applications. A total of 55 such cases have been allocated hearing dates comprising 36 sentence appeals and 19 undue leniency applications.</p><p>  The Supreme Court, however, continues to experience lengthy waiting times which are now almost four and a half years.  Waiting times for priority cases are in the region of 10 months at present. I am informed that there are 666 appeals which the parties have certified as ready to proceed in the Supreme Court List and awaiting hearing.  Although considerable efforts are being made to manage the waiting times, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Appeal. The referendum on the proposed Thirty-third Amendment of the Constitution (Court of Appeal) Bill will be held on October 4th 2013. In addition, it is expected that the appointment of two additional Supreme Court judges in the autumn will allow the Supreme Court to sit regularly in two Divisions which should have a positive impact reasonably quickly.</p></reply>

It is the Government's intention to ratify the Convention as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary. </p><p>  The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The Committee has identified as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments.  It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.  This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is in the process of assisting it to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p><p>  As regards my own Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and to exercise their basic rights, in line with the principles of the UN Convention.  It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity.  The enactment of this legislation is just one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the Convention.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004, the citizenship entitlement of every person born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January, 2005 is governed by the citizenship of the person's parents at the time of the person's birth or the residency history of one of the parents prior to the birth, in this case from 28/03/2009 to 28/03/2013.

However, over the course of the telephone conversation the applicant&rsquo;s mother indicated that she did not have sufficient documents to prove her residency as required.

Despite Ireland's reputation as one of the world's most globalised economies, 64% of private sector workers are employed by indigenous non-exporting firms, with 56% working for indigenous, non-exporting small businesses.  These numbers highlight the importance of domestic demand for sustaining and generating employment in Ireland, and suggest that our recovery strategy needs to give some additional support to small businesses.</p><p>  To that end, the 10 Point Tax Reform Plan contains measures to assist small business in a number of ways by:<blockquote>Helping their cash flow position; <br /><br />Helping them access funding;<br /><br />Reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance;<br /><br />Boosting demand for their products in new markets; and incentivising them to create jobs.</blockquote>  The measures are as follows:<blockquote>1. Reforming the 3 Year Corporation Tax Relief for Start Up Companies to allow unused credits to be carried forward to help create jobs and improve cash flow<br /><br />2. Amending the Close Company Surcharge by increasing the <i>de minimis</i> level to &euro;2,000 to reduce the administrative burden and assist cash flow<br /><br />3. Increasing the amount of expenditure eligible for the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit on a full volume basis (without reference to the 2003 base year) to &euro;200,000 to encourage innovation and help cash flow<br /><br />4. Increasing the VAT cash receipts basis accounting threshold from &euro;1m to &euro;1.25m to help cash flow<br /><br />5. Extending the Foreign Earnings Deduction for work related travel to Algeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal &amp;amp; Tanzania to help boost demand for Irish goods and services abroad<br /><br />6. Extending the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme to 2020 to help companies access funding<br /><br />7. Extending the general rate and Young Trained Farmers rate of stock relief and amendments to the definition of registered partnerships for stock relief to give a targeted assistance to the farming sector<br /><br />8. Introducing a Capital Gains Tax relief for Farmers for land restructuring to give a target assistance to the farming sector<br /><br />9. Reviewing the 'carried interest' provision in the tax code to help small businesses to access funding<br /><br />10. Announcing a joint Revenue and Department of Finance public consultation: 'Taxation of Micro Enterprises: Reduction in Compliance Costs' to identify ways to ease the administrative burden</blockquote>  Measures 1 to 9 were implemented in Finance Act 2013 which was enacted in March 2013. Revenue data on take-up of the various measures will not be available until the 2013 income and corporation tax returns of relevant businesses are filed with Revenue.  The exact filing date will depend on individual circumstances but in the main will arise in Q4 2014.</p><p>  To elaborate on some of the specific items in the plan, I would note that in relation to Measure 4, the annual turnover threshold for eligibility for the cash basis of accounting for VAT was increased from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.25 million in Budget 2013 with effect from 1 May 2013. While there are no direct statistics available, it is expected that over 800 businesses will have benefitted from this Budget change.</p><p>  In relation to Measure 5, the Foreign Earnings Deduction was extended in Finance Act 2013 to include the countries listed above.  This relief is available to all qualifying persons travelling to these countries for work-related travel for the tax years 2013 and 2014.  In relation to Measure 6, the EII is a state aid scheme and accordingly, the approval of the European Commission is required. An application was made to the European Commission in June to extend the EII until 2020. Officials continue to engage with the Commission in relation to the application and the extension will be implemented as soon as possible, once approval has been received.</p><p>  In respect of Measure 7, extending the general rate and Young Trained Farmers rate of stock relief and amendments to the definition of registered partnerships for stock relief to give a targeted assistance to the farming sector, provision was made in Finance Act 2013 and a Statutory Instrument will need to be signed once agreement has been indicated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  As regards Measure 8, Section 48 of Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from capital gains tax on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring, subject to a Commencement Order, which I made on 6 June 2013 (due to the need to obtain EU State Aid approval for the measure).  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes. The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase. </p><p>  Measure 9 relates to reviewing the 'carried interest' provision in the tax code to help small businesses to access funding. Following a review of the carried interest provisions in the tax code, Finance Act 2013 made a number of changes with the aim of making the provisions operate as intended. Firstly, it extends the scope of the relief so that it is not limited to carried interest derived from investment in trading companies at the start-up phase only. Secondly, it links the relief to the overall performance of the investment portfolio of the qualifying venture capital fund. Thirdly, it reduces the duration of the period for which the investment in the target companies must be held from 6 years to 3 years. Lastly, it extends the relief that is currently available to companies and partnerships to individual venture fund managers. These amendments are designed to assist companies engaging in innovation activities to access investment from venture capital funds.</p><p>  As yet, no information is available on the number of people who have availed of CGT farm restructuring relief and/or availed of the revised carried interest provisions because they will be applied for via personal income tax returns for 2013 which will not be submitted until late in 2014. It is not anticipated that these returns will include a provision for the separate capture of specific information in relation to these incentives.</p><p>Finally, in respect of Measure 10, 'Taxation of Micro Enterprises: Reduction in Compliance Costs', the public consultation closed in February 2013, and only a small number of submissions were received (7 in total).  The results of the consultation are being considered by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners at present, with a view to identifying next steps.</p></reply>

Relief is initially available to an individual at 30%, with a further 11% tax relief available where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company at the end of the holding period.  The EII commenced on 25 November 2011. Prior to this the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) was in operation.  As part of Budget 2013 I announced a 10 point tax reform plan to help small business.  One of the measures in this plan was the extension of the EII from its current expiration date of the end of 2013 to the end of 2020 in order to provide certainty to investors and companies.

Accordingly, an application was made to the European Commission in June to extend the EII until 2020.</p><p>  Officials continue to engage with the Commission in relation to the application.

In addition to the extension of the scheme, I also announced the inclusion of hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in the EII, subject to certain conditions.

These are that: Planned revenue consolidation measures outlined in April&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update remain unchanged. This is because the composition of GDP growth is crucial in forecasting tax and non-tax revenues and use of headline GDP growth would be misleading.  General government expenditure is maintained at the 2013 level. Questions regarding voted expenditure carryover effects from Budget 2013 should be addressed to my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The growth scenarios suggested by the Deputy are for real GDP growth.

By including provisions relating to access to data and security measures as well as provisions to help to deal with identity theft, this legislation should inspire confidence in businesses and in the consumer.  The legislation proposes to extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from micro enterprises and SMEs (with a turnover of less than &euro;3m) in respect of their data held on the Credit Register. This initiative may provide some comfort to enterprises where they have a concern in relation to the potential storing of inaccurate data and where they do not have the resources to take legal action through the Courts to seek to have the data corrected. Inaccurate data on the Central Credit Register could result in the refusal of credit to a small company.  In line with International practice, it provides for a retention period of 5 years in relation to credit information with respect to debts from the day on which it is entered on the Register. The Bill provides for the retention of information for a period of 6 months in relation to credit applications from the day it is entered on the Register. Anonymised information may be retained indefinitely.</p><p>  In addition, the Government is fully engaged in supporting the SME sector and has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved the targets for 2011 and 2012.  I have met the Boards of each of the banks in which the State has a shareholding three times since the start of this year. At these meetings, I have emphasised the importance of access to credit for SMEs and the need for an adequate flow of finance to be available to viable small businesses in Ireland.</p><p>  In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks&rsquo; capacity, processes and systems.  </p><p>  I should stress that the Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by the pillar banks as well as when credit is refused by them. I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.	</p></reply>

The penalty chargeable is equivalent to the Local Property Tax (LPT) that is payable, subject to a maximum of &euro;3,000.   Section 149 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides for the charging of interest on late payment of LPT at a daily rate of 0.0219%, an annual rate of just under 8%.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Revenue Commissioners have been contacting property owners who did not file an LPT Return to give them a final opportunity to comply.  In the absence of a response, Revenue, in accordance with legislation, has begun to deduct the Revenue Estimated amount of LPT at source from salaries and occupational pensions on a mandatory basis and, in these circumstances, interest does not arise.</p><p>  Self-assessed taxpayers have likewise been reminded that, if they do not comply, they will not receive a tax clearance certificate and face a surcharge on their forthcoming income tax return.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s priority this year has been to establish the tax and secure the yield for the Exchequer.  In due course, notwithstanding the fact that the estimated tax has been secured, Revenue will initiate a compliance campaign for outstanding LPT Returns and will challenge a proportion of returns on a risk basis, at which stage penalties and interest under Sections 146 and 149 of the 2012 Act (as amended) may arise.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners to LPT non-compliance is appropriate to ensure the highest possible level of LPT compliance while optimising the use of the Commissioners&rsquo; resources.</p></reply>

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities. </p><p>  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down Syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

Under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.</p><p>  Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. A framework document was published jointly by the Post Primary Management bodies and the NAPD (National Association of Principals &amp;amp; Deputies) in September, 2012 to provide guidance for school management in the allocation of teaching hours to guidance counselling in post-primary schools in the context of the decision in Budget 2012 to withdraw the provision of ex-quota guidance hours to schools. This should be of assistance to schools in terms of how they maximise guidance provision.</p><p>  My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools).</p><p>  My Department also has existing arrangements in place for providing short-term support to schools that are dealing with particularly acute incidents that arise due to tragic accidents, bereavements etc.. Five schools were supported in this manner in the 2012/13 school year.</p></reply>

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.</p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012. This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme. At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%. Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. </p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them. If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents. Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books. A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them. I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes. All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year. </p><p>I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. </p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012. This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes. None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.</p><p>  Many schools have adopted the use of ebooks and this is a decision for the schools themselves.  In deciding whether to adopt ebooks there are many factors to be taken into account.  The most important factor is to consider whether e-books will support the achievement of relevant learning outcomes and enhance the learning experience.  E books have the potential to provide learners and teachers with many different ways of exploring the curriculum.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education (former NCTE) addresses the use of tablets and ebooks in its training courses and is available to advise schools on these issues and a comprehensive advice sheet will shortly be available on the PDST TIE website.  Work is currently underway on a new ICT Strategy for schools and matters relating to the use of ebooks and use of digital content will be one of the key issues explored in that strategy.</p></reply>

The resulting report produced from this casework may, or may not, be used by school authorities to underpin an application to the NCSE for additional teaching supports and/or resources for the child or student in question (indeed a range of reports from medical practitioners and other clinicians may be used in this connection). This usage of the assessment report is not recorded by NEPS centrally - the main focus being the putting in place of appropriate interventions to ameliorate the particular difficulties faced by the child.</p><p>  By way of further explanation of the process used by NEPS I can inform the Deputy that in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p><p>  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educational Needs - A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007/8. In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process. </p><p>  The continua described above all involve a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools processes which moves from basic classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions and comprise three distinct school based phases characterised as follows:</p><p>  Classroom Support - is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,</p><p>  School Support - is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher. Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.</p><p>  School Support Plus - is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service (predominantly NEPS) in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes. This level of intervention is for children with complex and/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels. </p><p>  The staged model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration and intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need. The continuum approach ensures that pupils presenting within this range are dealt with quickly and at the appropriate level.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that NEPS psychologists undertook individual case work with some 8,402 children or students and NEPS funded a further 2,068 assessments under the SCPA Scheme in 2011/12. In 2012/13 7,898 cases are currently recorded as undertaken by NEPS psychologists (this however is not the final figure and subject to update) and 2,167 assessment were funded in schools under the SCPA.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.</p><p>  Under the school meals local projects scheme, funding is provided towards breakfast/snack, lunch and/or dinner clubs.  It is the responsibility of the school/organisation as to which club they choose to operate.  In the academic year 2012/13 there were approximately 550 breakfast/snack clubs funded under the school meals local projects scheme out of a total of over 2,000 food clubs.  The Department is currently in the process of finalising applications from some additional 80 schools to the scheme for the new school year. </p><p>  Priority for funding under the school meals locals projects scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  Following the provision of the additional &euro;2 million funding this year, the Department wrote to approximately 170 DEIS schools encouraging expressions of interest in participating in the school meals scheme for the current school year.  The Department also contacted a further 11 schools/groups who had previously made an application to join the scheme inviting them to participate in the scheme for the final term of the 2012/2013 school year &ndash; which one group, a School Completion Programme in Co. Wicklow accepted and joined the scheme during May 2013.</p><p>  In addition to the schools meals programme, the Department, through its child and social inclusion policy division, provided funding of &euro;22,500 in the form of a social inclusion grant to Healthy Food for All (HFfA) in 2013.  The purpose of this funding is to support programme activities aimed at improving access to a healthy and affordable diet.  The HFfA's breakfast club initiative is one of a number of programme activities co-ordinated nationally by HFfA to address food poverty in local schools and communities.  This food poverty initiative adds value to the Government&rsquo;s investment in the school meals programme. </p><p>  I am fully supportive of these programmes that aim to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, by reason of lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them.</p></reply>

The maximum duration of individual internships will remain 9 months.  Individuals will be able to avail of up to 3 internships.  Individuals will be permitted to undertake a maximum of one internship with a particular Host Organisation.  These changes reflect both the recommendations contained in the independent evaluation of JobBridge published by the Taoiseach and myself on 1<sup>st</sup> May, 2013, and a significant demand from interns and other individuals made directly to me.  This change will be of significant benefit to jobseekers as it will provide jobseekers who may be dissatisfied with their jobBridge placement more flexibility in finding a suitable alternative placement. </p><p>  However, those changes have not yet come into force.  When they do come into force it will be announced on the Home Page of the JobBridge website .  In relation to Education Sector internships, Host organisations can apply for internships in the Education sector, for the current academic year, up to 6<sup>th</sup> December 2013.  This provides sufficient lead-in time for these organisations to advertise appropriate internship opportunities. </p><p>  At 19<sup>th</sup> September, there had been 20,912 placements since the scheme commenced.  Some 91% of all these placements have had an advertised duration of 9 months.  In many cases, internships finish early however, I am encouraged to advise that 63% of all internships are completed early due to the intern securing paid employment.  This is a very positive outcome.</p><p>  At 19<sup>th</sup> September, 5,446 individuals were actually on internships and 3,061 internship opportunities were advertised on the JobBridge website.  A total of 9,965 host organisations have participated in JobBridge since the Scheme commenced.  Participation by Host Organisations on the Scheme is voluntary.  It is not feasible to provide a full listing of these companies in this PQ response.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused, in the first instance, on this cohort of unemployed people.  It is recognised, however, that not all unemployed people (including those previously self-employed) are dependent on the State for financial support and some services (for example assistance with job search activities, use of online job search tools) are available to such people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices. </p><p>  Unemployed persons (including those previously self-employed) not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through F&Aacute;S training or through further or higher education courses, but will not be eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking such training. </p><p>  Access to employment or work-experience-based programmes, involving the payment of a supplement to participants&rsquo; basic jobseekers&rsquo; payments, continues to be confined to unemployed persons who are in fact in receipt of such payments.</p></reply>

Gateway is a joint initiative between this Department and county and city councils and  responsibility for delivery of this initiative rests with individual councils.</p><p>  Participants are randomly selected by this Department from those on the Live Register for 24 months or more and currently in receipt of a jobseeker's payment.  Those agreeing to be considered then have their contact details referred to the appropriate council for recruitment.  Failure to respond to the Department&rsquo;s invitation or to offer an acceptable reason for being unable to participate in Gateway can result in sanctions for the jobseeker. The selection of participants has recently commenced by the Department in respect of Louth, Cork City, Galway and Mayo councils and recruitment in these areas is commencing.  County and city councils have projected that roughly 1,200 of 3,000 placements will be in the process of being filled by the end of 2013, with the remaining positions being filled during the first quarter of 2014.  </p><p>  The resources committed to Gateway by my Department for 2013 amounts to just over &euro;11 million.  The 2014 projected costs have yet to be finalised.  I have contacted all county and city councils to urge them to identify suitable placements, consult with stakeholders and make internal and local preparations for the roll-out of Gateway at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

The EAT upheld that 20 of the 22 appellants were entitled to a statutory redundancy payment from their former employer, the organisation to which the Deputy refers.   The appeals of the other two appellants were withdrawn at the hearing.</p><p>  Following the EAT decision, redundancy lump sum claims in respect of the 20 eligible employees were received by the Department.   The 20 claims have been awarded and payment of their statutory redundancy entitlement, issued directly to those former employees in May 2012.  It should also be noted that when the project closed, F&Aacute;S offered each JI Participant on the scheme alternative employment with other community employers in Tipperary, including the retention of accumulated service and pay. These positions were approved by F&Aacute;S, were additional to existing positions and would not have displaced jobs of existing workers. Only one person took up this offer.  </p><p>  In relation to an enhanced severance package, to which the Deputy refers, I am advised that no basis exists to enable payment of an enhanced severance package to Job Initiative participants.

However, as set out in the Programme for Government, the current Government undertook to review the situation with regard to raised bog natural heritage areas.</p><p>  This review is currently underway and the future of turf cutting on such sites is being considered as part of that review. It is my intention that the review will provide clarity for turf cutters and landowners, in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual landowners and turf cutters on these sites in due course.</p><p>  In April 2011, the Government made a decision to put in place a compensation scheme for those who have been required to cease cutting on the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation and my Department is giving priority to implementing this scheme. In the circumstances, and in light of the decision to review the approach to natural heritage areas more generally, the issue of any further purchase of land or rights in natural heritage area bogs, including the land referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, is being kept under review.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Tipperary, can be found on ComReg's website at .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme. Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &#8220;3&#8221;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in the designated NBS Electoral Divisions. The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013. The area referred to in the Deputy's question is serviced under the NBS.</p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published last Autumn, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Tipperary. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.</p><p>  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

In Louth, 15 properties made available by NAMA were purchased by Tuath Housing Association, using the Capital Advance Leasing Facility, and became operational in September 2012.  A further 12 apartments, directly leased by Drogheda Borough Council, also became operational in September 2012.  NAMA continues to work closely with my Department, the Housing Agency and with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in relation to the delivery of social housing.  To date, NAMA has identified over 4,300 residential properties, controlled by its debtors and receivers, under this initiative as being potentially available for social housing.  Demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,899 of these properties with a further 291 properties currently being evaluated, bringing the total that may be deemed potentially suitable to 2,190.  The local authorities have confirmed that of the properties identified, 1,359 are considered unsuitable by reference to sustainable planning and housing policy or are located in areas with no demand.  More than 800 other properties have been sold or privately let by their owners or receivers since they were identified by NAMA.   </p><p>  There is considerable complexity in dealing with multiple property transfers with varying degrees of difficulty attached to them.  In the main, this is due to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints.  Significant progress has been made in this context, with 296 properties having been delivered for social housing from NAMA's portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2013, including contracts signed in respect of a further 101 properties.  This brought the overall total number of residential properties completed or committed to social housing at that point to just under 400.  NAMA has recently indicated its confidence in the potential delivery of 2,000 units through this process.  It will continue to be my Department's objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available.  The next quarterly updates in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units will be available shortly at <i>www.housing.ie</i>.</p></reply>

I do not consider it possible to introduce amending primary legislation to provide for an extension to the deadline or to provide for an exemption for particular categories of vehicles at this late stage, and indeed, it would be difficult to make the necessary technical adjustments to the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) within the short timescale involved.  Further, exempting or extending the deadline for one particular category would inevitably lead to similar calls from other groups of road user. </p><p>  In relation to the issue of lost registration books , motor tax offices have been advised that, in order to facilitate the processing of declarations of non-use, applications should not be rejected on the basis that there is no registration document number on the application form, providing the application is otherwise in order and the vehicle and owner details correspond with the record of the vehicle on the NVDF.   </p><p>  For owners of vehicles recorded on the NVDF who are unable to locate the registration document for the vehicle, an application for a replacement document may be made at any time using Form RF134, which is available from motor tax offices or for download from .  It will not be necessary to do so before 30 September.   </p><p>  However, a registration book will be required, along with a Notification of Transfer of Vehicle Ownership, prior to the making of a declaration of non-use of a vehicle, in instances where the owner wishing to make the declaration of non-use is not the registered owner of the vehicle. </p><p>  A registration book may also be requested by the Motor Tax Office in instances where there is no record of the vehicle on the National and Vehicle Driver File (NVDF). The absence of a registration book will not necessarily preclude the updating of the record on the National Vehicle File as a manual pre-NVDF record may be in existence and the vehicle record can be updated on the basis of that information.  In such instances, liability for motor tax or the requirement to make a declaration of non-use of a vehicle will only arise from the date of updating of the vehicle record.   </p><p>  Vehicle owners should contact their local motor tax office for guidance in relation to their own particular circumstance s .   </p><p>Finally, in relation to vehicles that are no longer in use, it should be noted that the facility to make a declaration of non-use, where a vehicle is temporarily not in use in a public place, is to avoid arrears of motor tax when the vehicle is being put back on the road.  If the owner of the vehicle will not be put ting it on the road in the future , he or she need take no action in respect of the new procedures being put in place as no tax liability arises.   </p></reply>

To date, NAMA has identified over 4,300 residential properties, controlled by its debtors and receivers, under this initiative as being potentially available for social housing. Demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,899 of these properties with a further 291 properties currently being evaluated bringing the total that may be deemed potentially suitable to 2,190. The local authorities have confirmed that, of the properties identified, 1,359 are considered unsuitable by reference to sustainable planning and housing policy or are located in areas with no demand. More than 800 other properties have been sold or privately let by their owners or receivers since they were identified by NAMA.   </p><p>  It is difficult to put a specific deadline in place when one is dealing with multiple property transfers with varying degrees of difficulty attached to them. In the main this is due to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints. Within this context significant progress has been made with 296 properties having been delivered for social housing from NAMA's portfolio at the end of Quarter 2 2013, including contracts signed in respect of a further 101 properties.  This brings the overall total number of residential properties completed or committed to social housing at that point to just under 400 properties. NAMA have recently indicated their confidence in the potential delivery of 2,000 units through this process. It will continue to be my Department's objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available. </p><p>The next quarterly updates in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units will be available shortly at </p></reply>

IASIO personnel interact with all national services to maximise the opportunities for prisoners on release from prison.

These grounds are gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, and membership of the Traveller community. The prohibition applies to direct discrimination, whereby a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the grounds specified. However, also prohibited is indirect discrimination, where an apparently neutral provision puts a person of a specified gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, or membership of the Traveller community at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons, unless the provision is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. It is therefore open to a person who has been refused a private tenancy on the basis of being in receipt of rent supplement and who feels that this refusal is indirectly linked to his or her gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, or membership of the Traveller community to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts. Information and advice in this regard is available from the Equality Authority.</p><p>  While I have no plans to add further discriminatory grounds to this legislation at present, my Department keeps equal status and employment equality legislation under ongoing review.</p></reply>

The function of Visiting Committees is to visit the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoners.  They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed.  The Visiting Committee members have free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison.</p><p>  Details of visits along with the arrangements generally made by Committees are for most part contained in their Annual Reports.  In the case of St Patrick's Institution, the Committee reported that they met monthly and make regular unannounced visits where they meet and speak with inmates and respond to any issues that are discussed.  The Committee also reported on their commitment to supporting the Action Plan put in place by the Irish Prison Service to address the concerns raised by the Inspector of Prisons.</p><p>  I have previously stated my intention to strengthen the independent oversight of our prisons.  As I said then, the Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. </p><p>  A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons. As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons. I believe this will greatly enhance the Inspector's independent oversight of the prison system. Under the proposed new arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector of Prisons. In addition, Visiting Committees will be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time. They will continue their role of visiting prisons. They will also continue to meet with prisoners and liaise on their behalf with prison authorities. I believe this will make them more effective and improve the independent oversight of our prisons.    Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published early next year. When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

Category A Complaints are most serious level of complaints (assault, serious intimidation of prisoners by staff etc) and involves two elements of independent investigation/appeal &ndash; initial investigation by external investigator/s on behalf of the Irish Prison Service with a right of appeal to the Inspector of Prisons.  The Category A Complaints procedure was introduced on 1 November 2012</p><p>Category B Complaints are mid range in terms of seriousness (discrimination, verbal abuse of prisoners by staff, inappropriate searches etc) and fall to be investigated by a Chief Officer with recourse to appeal to the prison Governor and a subsequent recourse of appeal to the Inspector of Prisons if a prisoner is unhappy with the outcome of his/her original appeal (the latter is subject to the introduction of primary legislation).</p><p>Category C Complaints are essentially service complaints where a prisoner is unhappy with the level of service in a particular prison (visits, phone calls, etc.) and fall to be investigated by a Prison Officer with the possibility of appeal to a Chief Officer if the prisoner is unhappy with the outcome or resolution of his/her complaint.</p><p>Category D Complaints relate to complaints against professionals such as dentists, doctors etc.  Such complaints will be referred in the first instance to the prisons&rsquo; medical officer for possible resolution and, if this is not possible, to the relevant professional body responsible for regulating the professional involved.</p><p>The full complaints model will be introduced during the lifetime of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan (April 2012-April 2015).   The Inspector of Prisons will have oversight of all categories of complaints.  A publicly advertised recruitment campaign was carried out by the Irish Prison Service in September 2012 which sought applications from suitably qualified persons with a legal or investigative background.  A panel of 22 Independent Investigators was established following a selection and interview process.  The panel was established in October 2012 and will remain in place for 3 years.</p><p>The table below illustrates the number of Category A complaints received/investigated and under appeal since 1st November 2012:</p><p><table><tr><th>Number of Category A Complaints Received</th><th>54</th></tr><tr><td>Number of Category A Complaints Completed*</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Category A Complaints Currently under Investigation</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Category A Complaints that have been appealed (included in those under investigation)</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>*     Investigations are deemed complete when the Governor issues their findings on receipt of the investigation report.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Unit is primarily to assist Senior Investigating Officers throughout the country in the investigation of serious crime and to review serious cases that remain unsolved by continuing to pursue evidence and identify witnesses to assist in the development of these cases.</p><p>  While the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, I am advised that the level of Garda personnel assigned to the Serious Crime Review Team, together with overall policing arrangements, is continually monitored and reviewed, to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

Furthermore many modern organised criminal groupings are transnational in nature and poly criminal in their activities.</p><p>  However, I can assure the Deputy that the operation of such organised crime groups in the State is closely monitored on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that tackling these groups remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013.</p><p>  In confronting such crime, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement new operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks. In this regard An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na avail of advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies and apply multi-disciplinary approaches.</p><p>  This approach involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups on a number of fronts and across all geographical locations, including through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><p>  Furthermore targeted operations such as  the current Operation Fiacla which is focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries are also implemented in each Garda Region as required as part of the overall enforcement strategy.</p><p>  In addition, at the international level An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continues to work closely with neighbouring police forces to tackle cross border criminality and transnational criminal groupings. This includes ongoing cooperation and interaction with Europol and Interpol agencies.</p><p>  Finally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continues to work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora including the Joint Policing Committees and through community based initiatives such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced.  The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. One of the functions of the new Authority will be to establish and maintain a public register of charities. It is therefore necessary to establish the new Authority before this register is put in place.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority and register of charities, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place in 2011.  Arising from this review, I have delayed bringing this legislation into force as we considered how best to achieve the objectives of the Act in a context of Government spending reductions.  It has always remained an objective of the Government to strengthen the regulation of the sector in effective and proportionate ways and, to advance this, a public and stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the Charities Act 2009, and the establishment of a register of charities, was carried out by my Department earlier this year and published in July.</p><p>  Arising from our review of possible options in relation to the regulation of the charities sector and also from the extensive feedback received during the consultation, the Government in July approved my plans to proceed with the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority under the terms of the 2009 Charities Act.  It is envisaged that the new Authority will come into operation in 2014.  </p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.  </p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.</p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.</p></reply>

The operation of the Programme is supported by Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rigorously enforces the provisions in the law relating to witness intimidation and protection.  In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his/her family an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him/her included in the Witness Security Programme.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.</p><p>The following table shows the number of proceedings commenced and convictions for offences under Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the years 2008 to 19 September 2013.</p><p></p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Proceedings</th><th>Convictions *</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>16</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>58</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>43</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>31</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>18</td><td>4</td></tr></table></p><p>  *Figures are provisional as they are recorded in respect of the year in which proceedings commenced and may change in light of the outcome of court proceedings.</p></reply>

A wide range of stake-holders have provided, and continue to submit, views on the Bill which I am happy to consider. These views continue to inform the development of the Bill and to reflect its modern balance of interests between those of the legal professions and those of business or private clients who avail of legal services. As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.</i>Furthermore, as a sectoral objective under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding, it supports the objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and early economic recovery, building on the relevant recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group and the Competition Authority. It is essential, therefore, that this reforming legislation be delivered as undertaken.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Committee Stage of the Bill commenced on 17 July with initial progress made on the early sections of the Bill. On that occasion, I successfully introduced a series of key amendments to Part 2 of the Bill which have bolstered the independence of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority to the utmost degree.  Detailed work on the Bill continues in my Department in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and Committee Stage is to resume as soon as possible in the current session.</p><p>  In terms of written submissions, I have, as previously disclosed to the House, received just under 50 since publication of the Bill representing nearly 30 interested parties along with dozens of individual letters from concerned members of the public and practitioners and the formal observations of other Government Departments. The submissions have come from a wide range of bodies including the main legal professional bodies and associations, academics, civil liberties and human rights organisations, private businesses and government entities. They range in their scope from that of the entire Bill to that of particular provisions within it. For their part, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the King's Inns have provided substantive views which are among those to which consideration continues to be given. In addition, over the past 18 months both I and my officials have, together and separately, had meetings with various interested groups and bodies. Alongside those representing the legal professions, these have included such entities as the Competition Authority, the Consumers' Association and the Committee of Heads of Irish University Law Schools.  </p><p>   As I have previously announced, amendments to the Bill and a Regulatory Impact assessment will be made available for consideration prior to the resumption of Committee Stage. Pending that resumption I continue to encourage, receive and consider submissions on the Bill.</p></reply>

The allocation of Garda vehicles is monitored and reviewed on an on-going basis. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, an additional &euro;3 million was made available towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure 171 vehicles. This brought total investment in the Garda fleet in 2012 to &euro;4 million and resulted in a total of 213 new vehicles being procured during the year.  Furthermore, a specific allocation of &euro;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in the current year.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that to date this investment has resulted in 133 new vehicles being procured.  </p><p>  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to deliver an effective and efficient policing service.  In keeping with this approach, I will continue to seek to identify the potential for additional funding for the Garda Fleet.  This will, of course, be contingent on expenditure in other areas. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-25a.476.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013092500073#WRZ00900"><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that I have no function or responsibility in relation to the matter raised.  Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.</p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy I will refer him to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 1098 set down for written answer on 18 September 2013 which is detailed below.</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">I wish to inform the Deputy that there is no waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid as under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid on the applicant's appearance in Court.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">In relation to civil legal aid, it should be noted that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. (I have included below a table showing the waiting times for non prioritised matters at the Board&rsquo;s law centres. It will be noted that most of the centres are operating the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach. For particular reasons a small number are only initiating the process now).</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated;</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy;</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">- I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</div></p><p>Finally, the table below outlines the waiting period (in months), up to 1 September 2013, for persons awaiting a first or second consultation at the various Law Centres in the State, and may be of assistance to the Deputy.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Law Centre</b></th><th><b>Waiting times (months) *</b><br /><br /><b>General - Law centres not operating triage</b></th><th><b>Waiting times (months) **</b><br /><br /><b> for a triage appointment</b></th><th><b>Further waiting time (months) ***</b><br /><br /><b>where triage appointment previously given</b></th></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td><b>3</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brunswick St</td><td></td><td><b>4</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td></td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>13</b></td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td></td><td><b>10</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr><tr><td>Gardiner St</td><td></td><td><b>0</b></td><td><b>19</b></td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td></td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>12</b></td></tr><tr><td>Popes Quay</td><td></td><td><b>9</b></td><td><b>3</b></td></tr><tr><td>South Mall</td><td><b>14</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td></td><td><b>4</b></td><td><b>7</b></td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td></td><td><b>2</b></td><td><b>6</b></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td></td><td><b>2</b></td><td><b>2</b></td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td><b>5</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td><b>15</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St</td><td></td><td><b>7</b></td><td><b>8</b></td></tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H</td><td></td><td><b>0</b></td><td><b>11</b></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td></td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>11</b></td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td></td><td><b>10</b></td><td><b>6</b></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><b>10</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td></td><td><b>3</b></td><td><b>4</b></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><b>4</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td></td><td><b>5</b></td><td><b>2</b></td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td></td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td></td><td><b>6</b></td><td><b>11</b></td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td></td><td><b>7</b></td><td><b>10</b></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td></td><td><b>3</b></td><td><b>9</b></td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td><b>6</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td><b>6</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><b>7</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><b>9</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td></td><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>8</b></td></tr></table></p><p><i>* waiting times for centres not operating the triage approach.</i></p><p><i>** waiting times for centres operating the triage approach.</i></p><p><i>***additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.</i><bi>  </bi></p></reply>

The EWS has a current staffing complement of 74 officers delivering front line services, 2 of whom have distinct duties in relation to the education of children in places other than recognised schools.</p><p>Table 1 details the existing EWS distribution by regional office location, grade and officer numbers.</p><p>I am advised by the NEWB that the EWS worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer (EWO) and a multidisciplinary approach in order to address the complex barriers to school attendance.</p><p>The NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (EWS); Home School Community Liaison Programme (HSCL &ndash; 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (SCP &ndash; &euro;26.456m in funding provided to support 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. As part of this process the NEWB is also reviewing the basis on which the EWS was originally configured and a full consultation process is underway with EWS staff and their representatives to reconfigure and optimise service delivery to ensure an appropriate correlation between EWO resources, student population and their needs. I see this strategic national approach as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.</p><p>Vacancies that arise in staffing front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving are prioritised by my Department in so far as possible working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment.</p><p>The NEWB has a statutory remit to monitor school attendance. The Board's latest report on the Analysis of School Attendance Data, for the school year 2010 &ndash; 2011, is due to be published in November of this year. I understand that this latest data shows a continued improvement in student attendance from 09/10 and previous years. The number of school days being missed is at the lowest for the five year period 2006/07 &ndash; 2010/11 and while further improvements are required the positive trends over recent years are to be welcomed. This evidence further demonstrates the positive impact of targeted investment programmes to improving educational outcomes for children and the positive results that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of schools, parents, statutory and support services.</p><p>Table 1</p><p><table><tr><th>Regional Office </th><th>Sub offices covered in region</th><th>EWOs</th><th>SEWOs</th><th>Regional Managers</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Dublin City</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>vacancy</td></tr><tr><td>Leinster North / Ulster </td><td>Blanchardstown, Cavan, Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>vacancy</td></tr><tr><td>Leinster South</td><td>Tallaght, Bray, Clondalkin, Naas, Carlow, Clondalkin, Kilkenny,Waterford, Wexford</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Munster</td><td>Cork City, Skibbereen, Limerick, Thurles, Tralee, Ennis</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>West / North West</td><td>Galway City, Castlebar, Sligo, Donegal Town, Longford Town, Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Mullingar</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Totals </td><td>30 office locations</td><td>59</td><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Group has been working closely with hospitals during the year and progress has been achieved in relation to a number of interim targets, relating to doctors working in excess of 24 hours in a single duty/on-call shift and instances of doctors working in excess of 68 hours per week. The reorganisation of hospital rosters has been amongst the key measures pursued in order to reduce the working hours required of  NCHDs.  I am confident that progress will continue to be made towards the objective of full compliance with the EWTD.</p><p>  I am committed to retaining doctors who are educated and trained in Ireland within the system and to improving their career pathways and working hours.  At the end of July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs with a view to improving retention of graduates in the public health system. In particular, I want the group to set out a clear pathway for training at every level from Intern to Specialist, and to examine the potential for reducing the length of specialist training. I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently.  I have asked Professor MacCraith to provide an interim report to me by end November 2013 and a final report by end June 2014.</p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons of any age with a specific illness, such as cancer.</p><p>  However, under the legislation, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether or not &quot;undue hardship&quot; exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or his or her dependents. </p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. </p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

Data for 2012 from the three State Airports shows a modest increase in overall passenger numbers of 0.5% compared to 2011. However, a number of factors influence demand for air services so it is not possible to attribute increases or decreases of this magnitude to any one factor.</p><p>  There have been some positive developments in relation to additional capacity on US-Ireland routes for 2013 linked to both general traffic demand and the expected increased traffic linked to the Gathering. There has been an increase in passenger numbers through the three State Airports of 4.2% for the first eight months of the year.

In relation to the award of Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts for the bus market, this falls under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).  The NTA is currently considering how best publicly subvented bus services will be provided in the future. The direct award contracts for the provision of PSO bus market services held by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann expire late next year.  The awarding of the licenses for the services thereafter is a matter for the NTA, and not for Government, but I have kept the Cabinet updated on the process.   </p><p>  Where the NTA proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Under the legislation, if the NTA proposes to enter into direct award contracts, the relevant section states that  &ldquo;it may only do so where it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts&quot;.  If it is not so satisfied, it must provide for some level of competitive tendering.  This is not a decision for the Government or for me.</p><p>  The NTA is conducting its work in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and statutory consultations in relation to the matter commenced on 11 September and will conclude on 11 October. The NTA expects to announce its decision on how it intends to proceed before the end of the year.  It should be noted that it will be open to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to to bid for any routes or bundles of routes that are tendered. I envisage that tendering will enable the selection of the most competent tenderer who can provide the public with the best service at the least cost to the taxpayer.</p></reply>

This applies to vehicles in use in Ireland but not registered in Ireland, i.e. vehicles used for holidaying, as well as short term or contract work etc.     </p><p>  However, where a vehicle is re-registered as an Irish vehicle, it must go through the NCT once it is four years old or more.

The enforcement of Road Traffic Regulations, including those relating to the validity of a roadworthiness certificate, is the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.
