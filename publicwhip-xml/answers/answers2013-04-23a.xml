The combined wholesale and retail sector in Ireland employs 273,000 people.  The sector also supports employment in other related services, such as transport and logistics.  A number of new measures of particular assistance to retail businesses under pressure have been introduced by this Government including: the introduction of the Micro Finance Loan Fund and Credit Guarantee Scheme; reform of wage setting mechanisms and removal from the JLCs of the setting of a Sunday premium; extension of seed capital and employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector and reduction of employers PRSI and a low rate of VAT for certain sectors.</p><p>  In recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains a number of measures aimed at supporting the sector.  These include an initiative to increase the number of small businesses trading on-line and an initiative to streamline business licence application procedures.  The retail sector has been chosen to pilot the licencing initiative as it is one of the sectors which requires a multiplicity of licences and where the positive impact of streamlining the application process can be realised fairly quickly.  The intention is that an integrated licensing application system, incorporating up to 25 licences in the retail sector, will be developed in 2013. Additionally, the Government has committed to strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance and integration of local authority business support into a stronger local enterprise office to support the emergence of a better local environment for micro and small businesses.</p><p>  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan for Jobs, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group will comprise key Government Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.  The composition of the Group is currently under consideration by officials in my Department. The Terms of Reference for the Group will be agreed by the Group at its first meeting, which is due to take place in the 2nd quarter of 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-23a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300055#WRA01300"><p>The importance of innovation to Ireland&rsquo;s on-going and future economic recovery has been well recognised by the Government as being crucial to growth in both our indigenous and FDI sectors. IDA has transformed its investment profile with RDI projects increasing from &euro;80m in 2004 to &euro;700m in 2011 - representing some 50% of IDA investment wins. It was most encouraging to see that the recent European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in spring 2013, shows Ireland retaining its position among those EU Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems.  In addition, improvements have taken place in Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness, reflected in the fact that, in 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness ranking improved four places from 24th in 2011, to 20th in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2012.</p><p>  IBM&rsquo;s Global Location Trends Report of 2012 places Ireland:</p><p>  - 1st in the world for inward investment by quality and value;</p><p>  - 1st in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development;</p><p>  - 1st in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector; and,</p><p>  - 2nd is Europe and 4th globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.</p><p>  In a modern economy, highly innovative sectors deliver high returns. In Ireland, we have some of the largest and most dynamic medical device and pharmaceutical companies in the world. Nine of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world have a base in Ireland, as do eight of the top 10 medtech companies. The life sciences sector in Ireland accounts for over 50,000 jobs and &euro;50 billion worth of exports. High value added, productive manufacturing is increasingly dynamic, sophisticated and innovative and requires investment in research and development. Statistics show that exports from R&amp;amp;D performing companies have increased from &euro;44bn in 2003 to &euro;111bn in 2011, while for non R&amp;amp;D performing companies, exports decreased from &euro;48bn to &euro;30bn over the same period.  This clearly demonstrates the significant contribution investment in R&amp;amp;D makes to the national recovery effort.</p><p>  There are a number of factors which are likely to affect growth in industry; export-led growth is essential for a return to sustainable economic recovery and it is identified as a key component of the Programme for Government. Cost competitiveness is a critical foundation of international competitiveness and we are cognisant that we must use research and innovation to build a competitive advantage. Irish cost competitiveness has improved markedly over the last three years and we need to ensure this improvement continues.  Continued innovation in products and services is also crucial in building a competitive advantage.  Measures designed to support industry growth are set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 and include improved access to finance by SMEs, further improving our skills base, encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start‐up activity, assisting our businesses to grow, and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment. Building competitive advantage is also a key driver of growth and the Action Plan includes a particular focus on using Research and Innovation to drive job creation.</p><p>  In this context, the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to accelerate the economic and societal return on our STI investment, especially in terms of sustainable jobs.  In particular we aim to further strengthen enterprise engagement with and take-up of public research and to drive commercialisation. A number of initiatives are being rolled out across Government in support of this strategy.  Implementation across Government Departments and agencies of the recommendations in the report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group seeks to maximise the impact of our spend by focussing the majority of public competitive research funding on 14 priority areas which are most likely to deliver societal and economic impact. Other initiatives include expanding the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to cover applied research; a new Intellectual Property Protocol which gives more clarity and certainty around ownership of IP emerging from state funded research; the establishment of a Central Technology Transfer Office to act as a one stop shop providing an effective interface between industry and the research community; and the R&amp;amp;D tax credit scheme which continues to encourage business to invest in research.</p></reply>

A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the relevant parties.  </p><p>  As matters currently stand for those employees who are obliged by their contract of employment to retire at 65 years but will not receive the State pension until 66 years, the Department of Social Protection have indicated that, in terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Also, existing legislation provides that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions.  </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection, which has lead responsibility for the State pension and pension age policy, is chairing an inter-Departmental Group on Working and Retirement issues, on which my Department is represented.  That Department organised and chaired a Working and Retirement Forum in Croke Park last December, at which a range of stakeholder groups discussed, amongst other matters, issues related to the alignment of mandatory retirement age practices with the new State pension age.  The Group is currently considering the issues highlighted at the Croke Park Forum and is preparing preliminary proposals in this regard.</p><p>  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.  Directive 2000/78/EC is principally given effect in national law by the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011, which come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Mr Alan Shatter, T.D.  With regard to the extension of contracts, the Employment Equality Acts currently permit an employer to offer a fixed-term contract to a person over the compulsory (contractual) retirement age for that employment.</p></reply>

This was the first formal meeting of the EPSCO Council under the Irish Presidency.  I co-chaired the Employment and Social Policy element of the meeting along with my colleague, Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of the formal Council proceedings, there was a meeting between the President of the European Council and EPSCO Ministers which Ireland had convened at the request of President Van Rompuy. The informal discussions focused on better ways of co-ordinating economic and fiscal policies as well as enhancing the social dimension of the EMU, including social dialogue. </p><p>  Deliberations at the formal Council meeting included political agreement being reached on the Youth Guarantee.  This is a significant achievement for our Presidency.  The Council Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that every young person under the age of 25 receives a quality offer of employment, or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship, within four months of becoming unemployed.  When implemented, the Youth Guarantee will contribute to three out of the five Europe 2020 targets by:</p><p>  - increasing the employment rate,</p><p>  - reducing the extent of early school leaving, and</p><p>  - lifting people out of poverty and social exclusion.</p><p>  There were two policy debates during the Council.  Minister Burton chaired a lunch time debate on &ldquo;Pension rights to support Labour Mobility&rdquo; while I chaired a debate on the &ldquo;European Semester&rdquo;.  There was broad support for the valuable role the Semester process plays in working towards our Europe 2020 targets.  EPSCO also adopted the Commission&rsquo;s 2013 Joint Employment Report and Council Conclusions on the Annual Growth Survey.  The Council made a series of recommendations that fed into the European Council meeting on 14 and 15 March which provided guidance to national governments on strategies to be set out in their National Reform Programmes and Stability and Convergence Programmes.</p><p>  The 2013 European Semester is now well under way. This is a significant challenge as we move into the second half of our Presidency.  Member States are currently submitting their National Reform Programmes to the Commission for assessment. The results of that assessment will be presented on 29th May, together with proposals for country-specific recommendations for consideration by the EPSCO and ECOFIN Councils. </p><p>  The Presidency's Synthesis Report on the Implementation of the European Semester reflected the view that the EU needs to ensure effective delivery of efforts along the five priorities set in the Annual Growth Survey: differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring normal lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness; tackling unemployment and modernising public administration. In the areas specific to the EPSCO Council, it identified the need for Member States to address the following priorities:</p><p>  - active employment, social and labour market policies with particular priority to be given to promoting youth employment;</p><p>  - better performing education and training systems, ensuring that young people are equipped with the right skills and linking the worlds of work and education more effectively;</p><p>  - continued application to increasing female labour participation rates, reducing long term unemployment and ensuring full participation of older workers;</p><p>  - tackling the social consequences of the crisis and fight poverty and social exclusion.</p><p>  The Commission introduced its proposal for a Social Investment Package (SIP).  The measures in the package are aimed at enhancing people's capacities to support better involvement in society and better participation in the labour market. The intention is to benefit individuals' prosperity, boost the economy and help the EU emerge from the crisis stronger, more cohesive and more competitive.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-23a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300055#WRA01900"><p>North South economic co-operation is and will remain a priority of mine and of the Government. To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Ministers and officials, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation, in the border region.  From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the Trade and Business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council and, also, of the North South Plenary, which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, and particularly at the sectoral meetings, where I have direct discussions with my N.I. counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on a wide range of business issues of mutual interest.</p><p>  My officials engage in on-going dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (D'ETI). A key area of such regular engagement is on the operation of <i>InterTradeIreland</i> , the North/South Trade and Business Development Implementation Body, which is co-funded by my Department and D'ETI.  I am pleased that despite the serious economic pressures, I have been able to ensure that no significant cutbacks have been applied to our funding of that body over recent years.  Another key area of engagement at Departmental level is our joint support for enterprise projects under the <i>Interreg</i> initiative, which is co-funded by the EU, by my Department and by either D'ETI or the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel. The most recent significant such project involves the establishment of a significant North West Science Park, to be co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, in respect of which we have agreed financial support.  Officials in both jurisdictions are also engaged in a process which will hopefully see a new <i>Interreg</i>   Scheme initiated when the current phase expires in 2014. Officials of my Department are also engaging with D'ETI in relation to work on the EU's Regional Aid guidelines.</p><p>  In addition to direct Departmental engagement, there is a long history of co-operative action between enterprise agencies on both sides of the border to achieve mutual benefits. <i>Enterprise Ireland</i>, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes to drive job creation in border areas.  <i>IDA Ireland</i> collaborates with <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>, for example, in the <i>Northwest Now</i>  initiative. More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on Science and Technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.</p><p>  Several of the County Enterprise Boards in the border area are engaged in co-operative economic initiatives with various bodies in Northern Ireland, some funded by the enterprise strand of the <i>Interreg</i> programmes referred to above.  My Department, along with our enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with our counterpart Department and relevant Northern Ireland Agencies to increase the economic benefits, especially on job creation, research and innovation, which can accrue from practical co-operation.</p></reply>

The sector also supports employment in other related services, such as transport and logistics.  There are a number of bodies representing different parts of the retail sector, with RGDATA representing independent family owned grocery shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets.</p><p>  I launched the first of AIB&rsquo;s series of outlook reports for the SME sector on Friday last 19 April.  As that report was focussed on the retail sector and undertaken in conjunction with RGDATA, I met the Director General of RGDATA, at that event.  In addition, RGDATA was part of a &ldquo;Local Jobs Alliance&rdquo; delegation which met with Minister Bruton in September 2012.  In addition, a representative of RGDATA sits on the High Level Group on Business Regulation which I Chair as the Minister for Small Business, so we engage regularly on issues relevant to the retail and small business sector through that forum, including the meeting of 30 January last.  RGDATA have been active in making input in many areas affecting the business climate and many of the reforms introduced by Government have responded to these concerns.</p><p>  In recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures aimed at supporting the sector.  We are currently introducing new initiatives including:</p><p>  - Rationalisation of 25 retail licences and provision of a single retail licensing system;</p><p>  - Promoting a proposed competitive voucher scheme to assist retailers to go online;</p><p>  - Strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance;</p><p>  - Integration of local authority business support into a stronger local enterprise office to support the emergence of a better local environment for micro and small businesses. </p><p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of possible further measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group will comprise key Government Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.  RGDATA will be one of the representative bodies which is consulted as part of that examination of the retail sector.</p></reply>

Energy Costs remain relatively high in Ireland, particularly for SMEs.  While Ireland is the sixth most expensive location from 15 countries benchmarked, the cost of water for industrial users remains relatively unchanged since 2007. Waste costs in Ireland remain relatively high, particularly for landfill, while Ireland is also relatively expensive for broadband, particularly when broadband quality is considered.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs process, Forf&aacute;s undertook a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness. The sectors examined in the report are energy, telecommunications, transport, waste and water. The report, which was published yesterday, also assesses Ireland&rsquo;s cost performance in these sectors relative to our key competitor countries and the drivers of costs, in particular what drivers are within and outside our control in each of the sectors studied. </p><p>  The study finds that in many cases policy actions have a more significant impact on cost competitiveness than regulatory changes. The report suggests that there are a number of areas where changes to the operation of sectoral regulators could have a real and positive impact on cost competitiveness. These changes relate to the focus of regulatory mandates, the level and adequacy of resources, enforcement powers and sanctions available to the regulators, and the efficiency of the appeal process.  The recommendations set out in these two Forf&aacute;s reports will require careful consideration by all of Government before appropriate policy responses can be developed. However the Government is already working on the development of a policy statement on Economic Regulation and has opened a public consultation process on the matter.</p></reply>

Core to this work is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s parent Department, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on trade promotion. Enterprise Ireland also works closely with other Government Departments, such as Agriculture, Food and Marine, and Education and Skills, on developing specific sector export opportunities and enhancing the capabilities of these sectors to win more exports.</p><p>  In terms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, collaboration is strong with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s international offices co-located with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or another agency wherever possible.  This involves 22 of EI&rsquo;s 29 locations overseas.  A key forum is also the Export Trade Council which was established by Government. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Executive Frank Ryan attends the Council, chaired by the Tanaiste and that forum has a key role in fostering a collaborative approach to building Ireland&rsquo;s trade base.</p><p>  The relationship and collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is strong at all levels both in Ireland and in overseas markets.  In Ireland, Enterprise Ireland have a strong collaborative relationship with the Trade and Promotion Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on a wide range of areas, including:</p><p>  - Developing Ministerial led Enterprise Ireland Trade missions and events. 16 such Trade Missions were undertaken in 2012, double the number in 2011, with 18 scheduled during 2013.</p><p>  - Joint Economic Commissions (JECs)</p><p>  - Messaging overseas</p><p>  - Annual Market plans for each priority market as agreed with the Government&rsquo;s Export Trade Council.</p><p>  Overseas there is equally strong collaboration in individual territories between the relevant Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade team led by the relevant Ambassador or Consul General in that market.  This interaction covers a wide range of areas including;</p><p>  - Detailed information sharing and joint working,</p><p>  - Discussion on priorities and coordinating the focus of activities in the particular market,</p><p>  - Coordination on trade promotion activities,</p><p>  - Leveraging various networks such as the Global Irish Network,</p><p>  - Development and implementation of action plans /  priorities for Joint Economic Commissions where we have such JEC&rsquo;s,</p><p>  - Leveraging Ministerial visits and International Trade Missions,</p><p>  - Influencing discussions on trade issues / barriers where in some instances these represent a barrier to growth in bilateral trade with a particular country.</p><p>  It is worth noting, however, that the vast majority of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work overseas by its nature is direct detailed one to one client company work, assisting the thousands of existing and potential exporting Irish companies to identify specific potential market opportunities, evaluate those opportunities, develop detailed plans and strategies to target and secure new customers in new markets/sectors and build their export sales in those markets. Assisting Irish companies to develop and grow new and increased export sales in international markets is central to the creation and sustainment of much needed jobs in Ireland and is the primary focus and the targets by which Enterprise Ireland export activities is measured.</p><p>  EI are closely linked with development of EU Free Trade Agreements that are being negotiated with important centres of economic growth in Asia, for example with Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia and with major economic players globally such as Canada and Japan.  The proposed trade and partnership agreement with the U.S. will considerably enhance the opportunities for EI client exports in this important market.</p></reply>

This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and stimulation and economic recovery and growth. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that it is a complex project much progress has taken place.  In particular agreement has being reached recently on the Framework Service Level Agreement (SLA) between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities. This is a key document and will be the blueprint for each Local Enterprise Office going forward. The SLA sets out the structure, functions and role of the LEO as well as the respective roles of Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authority. It lays down the operating environment for each LEO i.e. protocols relating to project selection and evaluation, budgetary matters, corporate governance matters as well as the policies, guidelines and metrics required in each LEO. In addition the new LEO branding and associated logo has been designed and agreed. I will shortly publish and launch the SLA, and the LEO branding and logo both of which are tangible steps to the full rollout of the new infrastructure.</p><p>  The finalisation of LEO locations, accommodation arrangements and personnel resources for each LEO is continuing and increased focus will now be placed on the &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; issues such as integration of IT systems and Financial Management systems, management of transfer of data etc. all of which will be central to a smooth transition from a CEB structure to a Local Authority based LEO. It is vital to get these elements right so as to ensure a seamless transition in terms of client service and delivery upon dissolution of the CEBs.  In relation to the formal dissolution of the CEBs officials of my Department are continuing, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, to develop draft legislation with a view to bringing the Bill to Government shortly, with a view to enactment before the summer recess.</p></reply>

The availability of such data is crucial to understanding the background and context of the various business and trade issues which both our administrations are addressing.  A significant range of such economic data is compiled by our Central Statistics Office and by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) and this is publicly available. From time to time other research is undertaken by Departments and bodies on both sides of the border. Specifically relevant is the work of <i>InterTradeIreland,</i> the North South Implementation Body with specific responsibility for promoting trade development on an all-island basis, and which is co-funded by my Department, as this body has analysed and published data on key cross-border economic activities.  This is a valuable source of information to help inform future business activity and enhance cross-border engagement.</p><p>  In relation specifically to the finances of <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, I am very happy to confirm that the Body's budget has been kept relatively intact over the last number of years despite the enormous budgetary cuts implemented elsewhere. This has meant that that body has been able to roll out many successful programmes including FUSION, (Technology transfer), INNOVA (Collaborative Research &amp;amp; Development) and ACUMEN (Cross-border sales). I will of course continue to keep <i>InterTradeIreland's</i> operations under review but we must of course, be conscious of the fact that there should be no duplication of their work with existing programmes undertaken by the other enterprise development Agencies and bodies.</p><p>  In relation to job creation North and South, this is a key priority of both administrations on the island and we work closely on a range of initiatives. In addition to co-funding <i>InterTradeIreland,</i> as mentioned above, I regularly meet my counterpart Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  There is successful cooperation with the N.I. administration to ensure the implementation of the EU's INTERREG programme which assists enterprise development and both Departments work to ensure that all relevant areas for potential enterprise development, between the two jurisdictions for mutual benefit, are pursued. In addition, both <i>Enterprise Ireland</i> and <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>  have a long history of cooperation and have developed and rolled out many effective cross-border enterprise development initiatives that have benefitted firms in both jurisdictions and in the border region. The enterprise agencies will continue to work closely to ensure that all cross-border business opportunities are exploited.</p></reply>

The Act provides for a radical overhaul of the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It reinstates a robust system of protection for low paid and vulnerable workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the July 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</p><p>  Workers that were in employment in a JLC sector prior to the July 2011 judgment, continue, unless otherwise agreed with their employer, to be covered by their individual contracts of employment and enjoy the terms set out in the ERO that was in place up to 7 July 2011. Workers who commenced employment in those sectors after 7 July 2011 are covered by the full suite of employment rights legislation, including the National Minimum Wage Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act and the Payment of Wages Act.  The 2012 Act also provides that a Review of each Joint Labour Committee be carried out by the Labour Court. The aim of the review is to ensure that the range of sectors and enterprises to which they apply remains appropriate, with consequent changes to their Establishment Orders if necessary. That Review was completed on 12 April 2013. </p><p>  The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.  The Labour Court submitted its report of the review and recommendations in relation to the 10 existing JLCs to me only yesterday, 22 April. The report is detailed, comprehensive and complex and will require careful examination and consideration.  I would hope to be in a position to indicate my response shortly.</p><p>  It will ultimately be a matter for each Joint Labour Committee to negotiate the terms and conditions of employment for workers in their respective sectors and to be set out in proposals for Employment Regulation Orders which will require a Ministerial Order to be given legal effect.  Under the terms of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, the Government will report to the Troika by end June 2013 on the impact on the labour market of reforms to sectoral wage setting mechanisms undertaken under the programme of financial assistance. Forf&aacute;s is currently carrying out this review. </p><p>  The National Competitiveness Council reports on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position. The most recent report, while acknowledging an improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, identified a number of issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable, long-lasting competitiveness gains. Ireland must maintain focus on implementing a range of structural reforms across all sectors of the economy including issues relating to the labour market, competition policy, taxation, education and skills.</p><p>  A recently published (April 2013) Forf&aacute;s report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo; indicates that labour costs in Ireland have fallen marginally since 2008 and when compared with the Euro area, where labour costs have been rising in recent years, our competiveness position in this area has shown a significant improvement.  However the report also indicates that labour costs in Ireland have started to increase, albeit at a lower rate than elsewhere in the Euro area.  The report makes a number of recommendations which can improve the operation of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market, encourage employment creation and maximise labour supply. I and my colleagues in Government, will consider the recommendations set out in this report and develop appropriate policy responses to ensure that Irish labour costs remain competitive.</p></reply>

The Competition Authority is the statutory independent body responsible for enforcing national and EU competition law in the State.  In fulfilling this function it investigates suspected breaches of competition law and takes enforcement action where appropriate.  The Authority also has a function to promote competition in the economy and it does so by, inter alia, studying areas of the economy to examine how competition is working and by identifying legislation and administrative practices that impact negatively on competition.  </p><p>  The Authority has carried out detailed market studies into a number of sectors of the economy to establish how competition is working in those sectors and to identify any restrictions that hinder competition.  In this context the Authority has made recommendations, addressed to relevant Government Ministers, aimed at removing barriers or restrictions to competition within the sectors.  The Authority is currently examining how competition is working in the ports sector in Ireland and it has previously examined aspects of banking and insurance, the retail planning guidelines, the import/distribution sector and a number of professions including the legal profession, GPs, and architects.  </p><p>  Whether it is through the elimination of anti-competitive behaviour such as price-fixing and other cartel-like practices or through effect been given to Competition Authority recommendations the result is a more competitive and innovative environment with lower costs and greater job opportunities.</p></reply>

As I have pointed out on many occasions, the Government does not create jobs &ndash; entrepreneurs and successful businesses do.  However, the Government has a lead role to play in providing the environment where businesses can start-up, expand and create jobs.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has set the objective of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs in the economy by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  My role and that of other Government Ministers and Departments is to ensure that we have the right policies in place to support enterprise growth and innovation so that employment can be created and maintained.  The Action Plan for Jobs focuses on the creation of a supportive environment for businesses so that they can retain existing jobs and create new ones.  We are transforming our economy, step by step, by taking measures across all Government Departments and many State agencies to remove administrative burdens on business, improve their access to finance, further improve our export performance and support the development of key growth sectors.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is aimed at supporting the transition from the old, failed economy reliant on property, banking and debt to a new, sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation. In the year since we launched the first plan that transition has been gathering momentum, with 12,000 net jobs added in the private sector in 2012 and a record year for job-creation by exporting companies in multinational and indigenous sectors in the same year.</p><p>  One of the significant benefits of the approach taken in the Action Plan is that is has focussed Agencies and Departments right across Government to put forward measures that would make it easier for enterprises to develop opportunities and create employment. It is not of course possible to attach a specific job&rsquo;s target to many of these actions.  The results from 2012 demonstrate that the plan is working. However, the Government acknowledges that we have a long way to go.  If we are to sustain and accelerate this positive movement, we must continue a relentless focus across Government on jobs and competitiveness.  The challenge now is to build on the progress we have made, work harder, deliver more ambitious change &ndash; and we are determined to do that to tackle our number one priority and create the jobs we need.</p></reply>

Contracts and commitments worth over &euro;200 million to the Irish Economy were signed during the trade missions organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2012.  These contracts, together with the other business links established during the events, have helped grow and sustain jobs in Enterprise Ireland client companies.  In 2012 Enterprise Ireland client company employment totalled more than 169,000 on a full and part time basis, representing a growth in full time jobs of 3,338 in the year.</p><p>The Investment missions organised by IDA Ireland are more intimate in style. Typically, the programme involves meeting with Chairpersons, CEOs and other senior executives of leading companies, across all sectors.  Some of the companies which I met during 2012 already had substantial and valuable activities in Ireland and those meetings focussed on retaining, expanding and further embedding their presence here.  For companies who do not have a presence in Ireland, the focus was to underpin Ireland as a location for the proposed investment against intense competition from other locations around the world.</p><p>Immediate job creation is not expected from this type of mission as, typically, jobs are created over a period of between 3 and 5 years, depending on the company&rsquo;s business plan. I should point out, however, that IDA client companies created a total of 12,722 jobs during 2012. The net number of new jobs created at 6,570 represented the third consecutive year of growth in net employment, while job losses in IDA client companies were the lowest in a decade.</p><p>Details of

Parties may engage either on a voluntary basis through the Labour Relations Commission using the mediation and conciliation services, or under the Industrial Relations Acts to the Labour Court. In some cases, parties to a dispute agree in advance to be bound by the decision of the Labour Court.  The objective of the industrial relations machinery is to encourage either mediated or decision based outcomes for the parties.</p><p>  Employees may also make complaints directly to the Rights Commissioner Service and the Employment Appeals Tribunal under employment legislation.  The enforcement of Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) determinations and Labour Court rulings under employment legislation are a matter for the courts.  In cases other than those covered by the Payment of Wages Act, the Enforcement Services Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has some capacity to have a determination of the EAT enforced through the civil courts.</p><p>  In general, where an award has been made in favour of an employee, the employer has six weeks in which to comply.  If the employer fails to do so within this period, the employee, or the employee's trade union, may make an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to comply with the determination.  Where an employee is not in a position to do so the matter can be referred to NERA Enforcement Services Unit, which may, in certain circumstances, make an application to the Courts for an order on his/her behalf.  In deciding whether or not to intervene in the Minister&rsquo;s name, NERA has regard to the amount of the award, the potential for achieving a favourable outcome for the claimant and the scale of the costs likely to be incurred in doing so.  The enforcement of a Circuit Court order in these circumstances is the responsibility of the relevant County Sheriff and my Department has no capacity to intervene.</p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent and where a determination has been made by the EAT or an appeal to the Labour Court is in favour of employees, employees are entitled to seek redress from the State through the Insolvency Payments Scheme.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s key policy instrument to achieve this is the Action Plan for Jobs.  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on 22nd February.  The Plan contains 333 individual actions, broken down further into Quarterly deliverables. My Department and its agencies are responsible for delivering approximately 190 or 57% of the actions.</p><p>  As was the case last year, the delivery of the Action Plan for Jobs will be overseen by a Monitoring Committee co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the Secretary General to the Government.  Quarterly Progress Reports will be published on the achievement of the deliverables and this will include the job creation figures where applicable.  In addition, I regularly meet with the Chief Executive Officers of the Enterprise Development Agencies to discuss, inter alia, progress towards a range of targets, including jobs targets.</p><p>  In relation to the microfinance loan fund, Microfinance Ireland the company which administers the scheme, provides my Department with quarterly reports and has just compiled its report for the first 6 months (1 October 2012 - 31 March 2013). I can report that to end March, the scheme has supported 116 jobs in 44 microenterprises.</p><p>  I would emphasise that the transformation needed to grow jobs in our economy will be through deliberate and determined action across all areas of Government and the private sector. One year into the Action Plan for Jobs process, we can see the evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. Over 90% of the 270 individual commitments in last year&rsquo;s action plan were completed during 2012, we are climbing back up the international competitiveness tables, our exports are at record high levels and IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had their best jobs growth figures in 2012 many years. Overall, the level of private sector employment is stabilising, as evidenced in the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey figures for Q4 2012 which showed the first annual increase in employment since the second quarter of 2008.</p></reply>

This showed that Enterprise Ireland clients had exports of &euro;16.2bn in 2012 with export growth of &euro;1.793bn representing a 6.3% export gain on 2011.  Continuing to support indigenous companies to build capacity to grow employment, increase international sales and build on their success in 2012 is central to the Government&rsquo;s growth strategy that is underpinned by the Action Plan for Jobs, 2013.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, through its Development Advisors (DAs), works with almost 3,000 clients providing both soft and financial support to assist in enhancing their capability and employment potential and develop their growth strategies.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, Enterprise Ireland will continue to develop the recently published Potential Exporters Division as a new way of engaging with Irish companies that are not yet exporting.  Furthermore, in 2013 in direct response to the demands of entrepreneurs and client companies, a number initiatives are being rolled out in the areas of funding supports, export information and advice, R&amp;amp;D, management strategy and advice, and building competitiveness.</p><p>  Specifically under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, a number of capacity building initiatives will be supported as follows:</p><p>  - Competitive Start Funds (CSF) for specific groups of very early stage entrepreneurs (investing &euro;50k per start-up) &ndash; more than 155 High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) and CSF start-ups are targeted;</p><p>  - 15 Ministerial trade missions focused on sectors and High Growth economies are also targeted in 2013;</p><p>  - More than 300 mentors will be appointed to provide tailored advice and guidance to Enterprise Ireland clients; </p><p>  - A Pilot Initiative will be commenced focusing on enabling companies to research, evaluate and plan market entry strategies in new geographic markets;</p><p>  - Support 800 participants on short course Management Development Programmes. 170 participants have already commenced or signed up for these courses.</p><p>  - A participation target of 230 has been set for long term course Management Development participation across a number of courses including, &quot;Management 4 Growth&quot;, &quot;Leadership 4 Growth&quot;, the International Selling Programme and the Accelerated Growth Programme for CEOs of HPSUs.  This target is also set to be met. </p><p>  These supports are in addition, to Enterprise Ireland's continuing financial supports for client companies and are complimented by other measures, including, for example, the support of EI&rsquo;s overseas office network.</p></reply>

Innovation Vouchers worth &euro;5,000 are available to assist a company or companies to explore a business opportunity or problem with a registered knowledge provider.</p><p>  The Innovation Vouchers initiative, administered by Enterprise Ireland, has been designed to stimulate an on-going cultural shift with regard to innovation within the small business sector while bridging the gap that exists between the small business community and public research bodies. The vouchers can be used to facilitate knowledge transfer from the public research sector and small businesses and are available to the widest possible range of small businesses in Ireland.  Applicants need not necessarily be clients of Enterprise Ireland.  For the purposes of the Innovation Voucher Initiative, a Small Enterprise is defined as a company or (if part of a group) a group of companies where the total number of full-time employees in the company (or the entire group) is less than 50 and has either an annual turnover and/or an annual Balance Sheet total not exceeding &euro;10m. Small enterprises in the agricultural sector are excluded in line with State aid guidelines.</p><p>  Under the current guidelines<b>, </b>companies with charitable status, commercial semi-state companies, &quot;not for profit&quot; organisations, trade associations and company representation bodies such as Chambers of Commerce are not eligible to participate in the innovation voucher initiative.<b></b>This refinement of eligibility criteria was undertaken to direct the activity of the programme to companies involved in commercial enterprise or business whose main focus is generating jobs and/or exports.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland recognises that an important source of knowledge, expertise and competitive advantage available to small companies can be found in the research departments of Institutes of Technology and Irish Universities. The Innovation Vouchers scheme gives small companies access to this vast source of innovative acumen and in so doing acts as an important facet of knowledge transfer from the third level to industry. These vouchers worth &euro;5,000 can be used by the average small Irish company to purchase advice and knowledge that is new to the company.</p><p>  Innovation Vouchers were designed with the aim of planting the seed of innovation in small businesses, encouraging them to look to their future and seize the opportunities that knowledge and Innovation can bring.  As a measure of the success of the scheme in fostering collaboration, many of the companies who worked with a knowledge provider have since applied for more substantial funding from programmes like Enterprise Ireland's Innovation Partnership programme.</p></reply>

One of the key objectives of my Department is that of ensuring the protection of employment rights and worker health and safety. This objective is shared across a number of other Government Departments at a sectoral level.</p><p>  In the case of the Tit Bonhomme, I welcome the response of the lead Department in this instance, the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, to the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) report into the sinking of the Tit Bonhomme. That Department is in the process of implementing all of the safety recommendations in the MCIB report. I note in particular, the intent to enforce the European Community (Workers on board sea-going fishing Vessels) (Organisation of Working Time) Regulations, 2003 (S.I.709 of 2003). This along with the implementation of the other recommendations will greatly assist in encouraging a strong safety culture at sea.</p><p>  My Department's remit in this respect is generally limited to cases where there is an employer &ndash; employee relationship. Fishermen very often work on a profit sharing basis and as such are not deemed to be employees. I am aware of the contention that there are illegal workers operating in the industry. In terms of employees working illegally, this can arise where there is an employer-employee relationship and where the employee requires, but does not hold, an employment permit, or where an employee has not been granted permission to reside in the State by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  In this respect, my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality informs me that from an immigration perspective all non-EEA national migrants, whether working or not, must have the appropriate permission to be in the State. While there may be atypical elements to the situation where the person spends much of their time at sea, the general principle still applies. The Minister further points out that because a person may elect not to abide by the rules does not imply that the onus is on the State to regularise - far from it.  However, any migrant who is in the State in breach of immigration laws may apply to the immigration authorities for permission to be in the State and would be strongly advised to do so. Such applications would have to be considered on their individual merits rather than as a class but it can never be to the non-EEA national's advantage to endure exploitative working conditions for fear of possible deportation.</p><p>  My Department wishes to satisfy itself that it is fulfilling its functions where they may relate to the issue of worker safety at sea and the enforcement of employment rights. In the case of my Department, while its remit in this respect is limited to cases where there are employer &ndash; employee relationships there may be potential for my Department to contribute to the overall response. Therefore, I will be writing to my colleagues the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister for Justice and Equality offering my Department&rsquo;s support and assistance in any cross Government process whereby the State seeks to apply better regulation to this sector for the benefit of those who work within it.</p></reply>

In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities. This is given particular emphasis in respect of client companies in Kerry, who are located outside of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main Gateway locations.</p><p>  The provision of flexible and cost effective property and infrastructure solutions is a key aspect in developing regional value propositions and in attracting FDI. In this regard IDA Ireland will continue to market all available land and buildings in County Kerry and work with local authorities and property developers to deliver appropriate solutions in response to potential investors&rsquo; needs.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to win FDI, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve balanced regional economic development, the Agency prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region. The Gateway locations in the Mid-West and South West Regions include Limerick and Cork. However, IDA Ireland also highlights the opportunities provided by other locations such as the linked hubs in County Kerry of Killarney and Tralee, which are within commuting distances of the Gateways of Limerick and Cork.</p><p>  In 2012 I attended a briefing meeting on the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 in Tralee, along with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan and all of the relevant enterprise support agencies. The schedule of Action Plan for Jobs 2013 briefings has not yet been finalised, but it is hoped that another meeting can be facilitated in Tralee as part of that schedule.</p><p>  I am mindful, also, that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014, when IDA Ireland's current strategy is implemented. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.</p><p>  Meanwhile IDA's commitment to delivering business to County Kerry continues and, while globally the outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, there are still investment opportunities in global markets. IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 12,000 jobs in 2013 as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

Of course, I recognise that many existing businesses are tied into higher property costs having purchased or leased property with upward only rent review clauses during the property boom.</p><p>  The Government has taken steps to address the issue of upward only rent reviews where possible. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property. I understand that by the end of 2012, NAMA had received 276 eligible applications for rent abatement and had granted 212 applications with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million. A further 56 applications were under review.  Of the 276 eligible applications received, only 8 were refused. Other property related costs such as stamp duty on transactions have recently been reduced. Local Authority rates have fallen marginally in the past three years and we will continue to encourage Local Authorities to exercise restraint in setting commercial rates and, where possible, to reduce rates.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific actions to be implemented to support a sustainable commercial property market. These include:</p><p>  - Ensuring that the commercial leases database is established and fully operational in 2013.</p><p>  - The completion of a review of the Rent Review Arbitration Code to consider the effectiveness of the code in resolving disputes over rent reviews, and the degree to which stakeholders are making use of the code and to</p><p>  - Enact and implement the Valuations Bill in order to accelerate the revaluation of properties for commercial rates purposes.</p></reply>

The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of measures which will support the retail sector, including an initiative to introduce a single portal for business licence applications, a new scheme to help more businesses to trade on-line, and the integration of local business supports into a stronger Local Enterprise Office network to improve provision for micro and small enterprises.  Additionally, the Government has committed to strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance, which can often be a problem for retail outlets.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has undertaken to review activity in the report published in 2012 by the County and City Managers' Association (CCMA) which identified actions, projects and activities undertaken by Local Authorities which can be seen to contribute to local development, enterprise support and economic growth.  This action may also have relevance for the retail sector at a local level.  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  This Interdepartmental Group will be chaired by my Department.</p><p>  I am aware that the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation recently received a presentation from representatives of the retail sector on the impact that parking restrictions can have on retail outlets in town centres.  I will ask my officials to examine the paper on town-centre parking, in the context of the work of the Interdepartmental Group referred to above.</p></reply>

Donegal's industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry to high tech, high skill activity. Accordingly, IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing client base to encourage them to transform and expand their existing operations while actively encouraging new investment in Donegal in knowledge based industries and high-end manufacturing, mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector. In October 2012 KeyedIn solutions announced its plans to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny with the creation of 20 highly skilled jobs over a period of three years.</p><p>  The challenge facing IDA Ireland is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very challenging global environment.  International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase. Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated, professional and business support services. Consequently, when marketing potential locations for site visit to clients, IDA Ireland has to be credible and competitive in its approach, in the face of stiff international competition for FDI, as locations must meet the criteria of the client company in respect of skills, labour, site and/or buildings and infrastructure.  Donegal is part of IDA's North West Region, along with Counties Leitrim and Sligo, and this Region has two urban centres of sufficient scale - Letterkenny and Sligo- to meet these criteria.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has also assured me that it continues to focus on the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry.  This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the North West Business &amp;amp; Technology Zone (NWBTZ), which aims to promote the linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry in line with the NI Regional Development Strategy 2025.</p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI projects, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.  This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.</p><p>  In the interim, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to win FDI projects for County Donegal. While the global outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, the Agency has assured me that it will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 12,000 jobs this year as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

In general, Irish law does not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial relations dispute, but rather is designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences. Employer and trade union interests have remained committed to this approach in the interest of the harmonious conduct of industrial relations for more than half a century. The State takes a supportive role, by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper, rather than an interventionist one. Institutions such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court were established to assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers.</p><p>  The experience and expertise of the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best avenue for resolving issues in dispute. In this context, it is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the decisions or recommendations made.  Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding. Neither the Labour Court, not I, can compel a company or its employees to comply with such a recommendation. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties involved.  I have no plans to make any changes to Industrial Relations Acts which would compel either party to a dispute to accept a Labour Court recommendation in disputes referred under those Acts.</p><p>  With regard to employment rights legislation, I currently have discretion to pursue enforcement proceedings on behalf of claimants under certain employment rights enactments. This role is carried out by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) on my behalf. Alternatively, individual claimants can take enforcement proceedings themselves or through their trade union.  In order to have credibility, a system of employment rights adjudication must be backed up by an efficient and effective enforcement regime. Therefore, there is a need for a robust method of enforcement of awards.</p><p>  As you may be aware, I have commenced a root and branch reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services. The reforms which I propose to introduce will include improved measures to secure the enforcement of awards made by the State's Workplace Relations adjudication bodies.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill, which will give legislative effect to the new Workplace Relations structures, has been approved by Government for priority drafting and I hope to publish this Bill during 2013.  As part of this Reform Programme, I propose to put in place a more robust method of enforcement of awards. It is proposed that there will be an Enforcement Section within the new structures that will implement the revised enforcement system, where the District Court will have considerable enforcement powers in relation to decisions of Adjudication Officers of the WRC and determinations of the Labour Court.</p><p>  I am confident that the measures which I propose to introduce in the Workplace Relations Bill will provide a legislative basis to facilitate the more effective enforcement of awards made under the reformed Workplace Relations adjudication structures.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains a number of measures that specifically support graduates and includes commitments to support graduates in specific sectors such as the food industry and ICT.  One of the ambitions outlined in the Plan is that, by 2018, Ireland will have the highest percentage of computing graduates as a proportion of all tertiary graduates.  That process will begin in 2013 through a process of increased programme places, reskilling and conversion courses, and through targeted migration of key skills groups.</p><p>  In the area of labour market activation, the JobBridge scheme operated by the Minister for Social Protection has proven to be very successful in providing opportunities for graduates to get valuable employment experience.  A recent review of the scheme, carried out by Indecon consultants, found that more than half of participants had gone on to paid employment after their internships ends.</p><p>  The Irish Research Council has launched the 2013-2014 round of its Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowships, including the Enterprise Partnership Postdoctoral Scheme and the International Career Development Fellowship. The Council facilitates the career development of researchers by funding those at an early stage of their postdoctoral career to associate with established research teams who have achieved international recognition for their work.  The Council aims to support an expertise-driven research system in order to enhance Ireland's innovation capacity and skills base in a rapidly changing global environment where knowledge is key to economic, social and cultural development.</p><p>  In relation to my own Department, amongst a range of programme offerings, Science Foundation Ireland continues to promote the study of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) disciplines, to ensure that graduates have the knowledge and skills to avail of opportunities in high value-added sectors. In addition, last week SFI launched a new initiative, the SFI Industry Fellowships programme, which in time should ensure that more research graduates are employed in industry. The SFI Industry Fellowships will also help to increase industrial R&amp;amp;D in Ireland, upskill Irish firms, assist SMEs to develop and grow, and help the IDA win new companies to Ireland.</p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland operates programmes such as Graduates 4 International Growth, which assists companies with ambitious growth plans in key markets to create one or more entry-level graduate market researcher positions.  Graduate market researchers work overseas for 12 months to complete a project related to the company's growth plans in the overseas market.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland also runs the New Frontiers<b></b>programme, which is an entrepreneur development programme delivered at a local level by the Institutes of Technology.  The programme provides successful applicants with a package of supports to help accelerate their business ideas and to equip them with the skills and contacts necessary to successfully start and grow their company. It may be of particular interest to new graduates.</p></reply>

When we launched the first in a series of annual Action Plans for Jobs in February 2012, I said that the transformation needed for our economy would not come through one big bang solution but through deliberate and determined action across all areas of Government and the private sector.</p><p>  One year into the Action Plan for Jobs<i></i>process, we can see the evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. There were 270 individual actions committed to last year, to improve the operating environment and supports for job-creating businesses, and remove barriers to employment-creation right across our economy. Over 90% of these actions were completed during 2012.  More importantly there has been a stabilisation in jobs numbers in the last six months and, last year 12,000 jobs were created in the private sector, in particular in export oriented companies. The compares to the 250,000 private sector jobs lost in the three years before this Government took office.</p><p>  As with 2012, employment retention and creation will continue to be our primary objective in 2013. I am confident that we now have a structure in place that can deliver the type of actions needed to continue supporting the transition underway in our economy.</p><p>  This year's Action Plan for Jobs includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies or Offices.  The plan also includes seven Disruptive Reforms that the Government have identified as having potential to have a significant impact on job creation. In addition, the experience and perspective of the six industry partners, recently appointed jointly by myself and the Taoiseach, will prove invaluable as we take on these strategically significant challenges. This can only help us in achieving the vital task of growing our economy and getting our people back to work in increasing numbers and achieving the target of 100,000 more people at work by 2016.</p></reply>

The recently published Forf&aacute;s report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo; identifies a number of issues relating to transport costs in Ireland. Prices for transport related services have generally remained stable since 2006, with the exception of air transport which has increased significantly since 2010.  There has been significant investment in national transport routes over the last decade and this has led to significant improvements in connectivity for Irish enterprises. However a number of bottlenecks still remain. </p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of actions to review and update policies across different modes of transport to deliver an efficient and integrated transport system including:</p><p>  - Completion of the review of Ports Policy</p><p>  - Publication of Competition Authority study into Ports</p><p>  - Development of a new aviation policy to deliver competitive international access</p><p>  - Development of a land transport strategic investment framework to decide what investment will be required out to 2025 to facilitate easy access to markets and the mobility of the workforce.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s report makes a number of recommendations aimed at reducing transport costs, most of which come under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and / or the Minister for Finance.

Promoting entrepreneurship, attracting inward investment and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise across all regions is vital to ensuring a vigorous pipeline of new business leaders, new business ideas and entrepreneurial activity.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a whole of Government, national strategy aimed at creating and sustaining jobs across all regions of the State. The objective of balanced regional development is supported by the EU Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines, which recognise that some regions can face significant structural disadvantage.  The Guidelines permit Member States to grant higher investment aid to these areas.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s current Regional Aid Map, the highest rates are afforded to the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) region.</p><p>  The establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide micro enterprise support through the dissolution of the existing CEB offices and the creation of a new network of Local Enterprise offices (LEOs) will ensure an enhanced delivery of support to micro enterprises in the regions in question and nationally.</p><p>  Microfinance Ireland is providing support, in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 available to start-up, newly-established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.</p><p>  I understand from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013, LEADER provides both direct and indirect support to enterprise start-ups and already established microenterprises in rural areas all over Ireland.  Since 2009, almost &euro;20m has been provided for direct support to enterprise in rural Ireland through the RDP.  A significant proportion of the resources provided through the RDP Training Measure, which has registered a further &euro;10m in expenditure to date, also provide indirect capacity building and mentoring support for rural entrepreneurs. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to work with its 700 client companies in the region to support their growth in 2013.  To support the development of a pipeline of High Potential Start-Ups in the Border region, EI has the following initiatives in place:</p><p>  - The New Frontiers Programme, with funding of &euro;4.25m, in IT Sligo/Letterkenny and Dundalk Institute of Technology/DCU.</p><p>  - On February 15, 2013 the Government launched a &euro;200k Competitive Feasibility Fund aimed at stimulating start-ups and creating jobs and growth in the North East Region.

A further &euro;32.5 million of available funding is projected for 2013. For the years 2007 to 2008 no budget was available, and during 2009-2010 &euro;4 million became available.  At present, all calls and evaluations have been completed for the first 3 Work Programmes (2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012). However, there has been no Irish involvement in any of the PCP related actions in these calls. </p><p>  It is important to point out that FP7 funding is made available under a Call for Proposals, competitive procedure, amongst the 27 EU Member States and participating Associate Countries. It is also important to note that Pre-Commercial Procurement and Public Procurement of Innovative solutions are relatively new areas under FP7.  In fact, under this year&rsquo;s 2013 Call for this Work Programme, PPI instruments will feature for the first time, in anticipation of their wide-scale use in Horizon 2020 to fund innovation procurement. So, while in theory this funding is available to Ireland, in order to be in a position to avail of it, Irish research organisations must have the capability to compete in this particular area and must be successful in the Call for Proposals procedure.  </p><p>  In regard to PPI in the FP7 ICT and CIP Programmes, since this is the first year that PPI instruments will be implemented in CIP ICT PSP, the actual funding awarded to Ireland will not be known until July/August 2013, when this year&rsquo;s calls will have been evaluated.  The total EU funding available, for all Member States and Associated Countries in ICT PSP, for PPI Pilots and PPI related activities, for the 2013 Call is &euro;12 million. This is comprised of &euro;10 million for PPI Pilots, and &euro;2 million for Thematic Networks to prepare for PPI pilots.  </p><p>  CIP ICT Policy Support Programme is only one of three &quot;pillars&quot; of the overall CIP. Throughout 2013 Enterprise Ireland will also be engaging with CIP funding through the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) which is the primary instrument for the CIP programme.  As suitable calls arise, the EEN will be engaging with its client base.   One very concrete benefit to Ireland and SMEs from this programme is its joint funding of the Enterprise Europe Network, which is in the region of &euro;450,000 per year.</p><p>  Ireland was not represented at the Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) and Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions (PPI) Conference in Berlin, on 21 &ndash; 22 March, 2013 which was co-organised by the European Commission and the Federal Minister of Economics and Technology and regional Ministries of North Rhine-Westphalia.</p></reply>

However, where a client company elects to participate in knowledge events or to commission specific research in the field EI will charge a contributory fee.  The fact that such activities are subsidised by Enterprise Ireland renders it a support to a business rather than a charge.  Examples of events where Enterprise Ireland client companies contribute to overall costs include the following:</p><p>  - <b>Client Management Development</b> - In partnership with international and Irish business schools, Enterprise Ireland has put in place a number of programmes that assist companies to builds skills and competencies, grow their businesses and develop their export potential.  The general rule in these cases is that Enterprise Ireland will cover 70% of the costs of the company if it is an SME and 50% of the costs if it is a large company.  The balance of the cost is covered by the company.</p><p>  - <b>Participation on an Outward/Trade Mission</b> - A mission participation fee of &euro;500 is sought per participating company. The fee represents a contribution toward receptions, group transport/transfers and administration. Additional costs may be levied directly to the client depending on the specifics of the trade mission.</p><p>  - <b>Participation at Trade Fairs</b> - Enterprise Ireland seeks to recoup 50% of the total gross costs (floor space, design and construction costs and any additional costs of client companies' participation on the stand) of the space they occupy or benefit from.  Enterprise Ireland pays 100% of the space it occupies on the stand.</p><p>  County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) support micro enterprises through direct grant aid and training and support measures - the latter being subsidised by the Boards.  The Board may charge fees to clients for participation in their training or mentoring programmes.  Whilst these charges are based on a number of factors - such as trainer costs - the CEBs will always consider the participant's ability to pay.  If the participant is unemployed, the Board may decide to waive the fee.  CEBs also provide a facility to pay by way of installments.  Fees for specific interventions such as the National Mentoring Scheme provide for a fixed rate of payment to the mentor.  Management Development courses are usually offered through a package of interventions.  These include various training elements at a set fee. </p><p>  The two Enterprise Agencies who report to my Department and who have significant property portfolios, namely IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, have confirmed that, where businesses are in difficulties, they have, on a case by case basis, responded to and facilitated companies' requests for reduced rent and will continue to do so.  I can assure the Deputy that the Enterprise Development Agencies continually seek to keep fees to a minimum. </p></reply>

As I have pointed out previously to the House, achieving this target requires a transformational change to our economy.  This Government, when it came into office, was starting from a position where more than 250,000 private sector jobs had been lost in the previous three years. This was primarily the result of relying, for a number of years, on economic growth fuelled by a property price and construction sector bubble. </p><p>  The new economy which we need to build must be based on enterprise, innovation and exporting.  The transformation which we need to bring about will require progress on a number of fronts, including fixing our banking systems, reforming the public sector and embedding a jobs agenda across Government through the Action Plan for Jobs.  Key areas which I have been working on directly to support job creation by enterprise include improving access to finance for businesses, reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, reducing other costs and administrative burdens for enterprise, improving our export performance, and supporting innovation.  Details of progress on these measures are available in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Action Plan for Jobs which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  This is a huge task, but we are making progress. We are climbing back up the international competitiveness tables again; our exports are at record high levels, not even seen at the peak of the boom; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had their best years for jobs growth in 2012 for ten years and five years respectively and overall, the level of private sector employment is stabilising.</p><p>  While these signs of recovery are welcome there is much more to be done to get more of our people back to work. That is why the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs is more ambitious than the 2012 Plan and it introduces the idea of Disruptive Reforms, seven significant projects that require cross Government collaboration that can make a real difference to enterprise and jobs. The goals attached to them are ambitious in nature and they have aggressive timescales in which they will be delivered. They will also require new ways of working.</p><p>  We are making real progress, but I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge that still faces us.  As a small open economy, we are influenced heavily by the challenging developments in international markets.  However, the merit of the Action Plan for Jobs is that every year, each Department is required to focus on changes that can be brought about to make a practical contribution to the target of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2016.</p></reply>

Germany is Europe&rsquo;s largest economy and one of Ireland&rsquo;s top-4 trading partners. In 2012 Irish goods exports to Germany, at over &euro;7.5billion, were up 20% on 2011. Germany is also the world&rsquo;s third-largest source of tourists to Ireland, with over 400,000 German tourists visiting Ireland in 2012. </p><p>  My St Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme focused on building on the strong relationships that exist already, further grow our exports and create the jobs we need. My programme included:</p><p>  - 9 bilateral meetings with IDA and Enterprise Ireland target companies</p><p>  - A trade/investment event with over 100 companies</p><p>  - 5 Irish tourism/cultural events</p><p>  - 2 Bord Bia events to promote Irish food exports</p><p>  - Interviews with German media as part of the continuing drive to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s reputation</p><p>  I am confident that this jobs focused trade and investment-related programme has helped Enterprise Ireland clients cement relationships with their German partners and win access to key decision-makers in target sectors which should facilitate employment growth. It has also helped German investors to continue to see Ireland as an attractive location for foreign direct investment and further expand operations and employment in Ireland.</p></reply>

Job destruction figures peaked at 512,000 when 2009 was compared with 2008 before dropping back sharply in 2010.</p><p><b>Table 1 Job creation and job destruction figures for the business economy, manufacturing and the services sectors 2006 -2010</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th><div>2006</div></th><th><div>2007</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th></tr><tr><td>Business economy excluding activities of holding companies(NACE Rev. 2 Sectors B to N, excluding code 642)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)</td><td><div>1,971,797</div></td><td><div>2,118,610</div></td><td><div>1,986,684</div></td><td><div>1,645,874</div></td><td><div>1,539,894</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)</td><td><div>353,614</div></td><td><div>375,167</div></td><td><div>217,819</div></td><td><div>168,725</div></td><td><div>184,176</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)</td><td><div>198,209</div></td><td><div>228,356</div></td><td><div>349,745</div></td><td><div>511,855</div></td><td><div>290,785</div></td></tr><tr><td>Industry (NACE Rev. 2 Sector B-E)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)</td><td><div>309,351</div></td><td><div>317,276</div></td><td><div>300,694</div></td><td><div>255,709</div></td><td><div>230,430</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)</td><td><div>34,591</div></td><td><div>35,355</div></td><td><div>20,861</div></td><td><div>19,173</div></td><td><div>18,619</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)</td><td><div>22,508</div></td><td><div>27,430</div></td><td><div>37,443</div></td><td><div>59,151</div></td><td><div>33,869</div></td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing (NACE Rev. 2 Sector C)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)</td><td><div>279,919</div></td><td><div>285,944</div></td><td><div>269,392</div></td><td><div>226,714</div></td><td><div>203,879</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)</td><td><div>31,375</div></td><td><div>31,976</div></td><td><div>18,136</div></td><td><div>17,020</div></td><td><div>16,977</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)</td><td><div>20,496</div></td><td><div>25,951</div></td><td><div>34,688</div></td><td><div>54,998</div></td><td><div>29,992</div></td></tr><tr><td>Business economy services excluding activities of holding companies (NACE Rev. 2 Sectors G to N, excluding code 642)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)</td><td><div>1,385,776</div></td><td><div>1,517,830</div></td><td><div>1,457,442</div></td><td><div>1,242,994</div></td><td><div>1,198,526</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)</td><td><div>248,919</div></td><td><div>280,460</div></td><td><div>167,094</div></td><td><div>135,706</div></td><td><div>149,023</div></td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)</td><td><div>139,528</div></td><td><div>148,406</div></td><td><div>227,482</div></td><td><div>358,296</div></td><td><div>206,309</div></td></tr><tr><td>Source: Job Churn statistics, Central Statistics Office</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>Detailed breakdowns are available at: <i>http://cso.ie/shorturl.aspx/102</i>.</p><p>Methodological notes are available at:<i> http://cso.ie/shorturl.aspx/101</i>.</p></reply>

The application was made through the Passport Express service which is a ten working-day service for properly completed applications.   Under this service, the Department was obliged to issue a passport to the applicant no later than 5 April, 2013 if the application was in order. The first of these related to the lack of documentation to demonstrate the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship, which is a primary requirement under the Passports Act, 2008. The second concerned the incorrect completion of the declaration section of the application form by one of the applicant&rsquo;s parental guardians.</p><p>  The Department rang the applicant&rsquo;s father on 5 April to inform him of these problems.  He was advised of the additional documents which were needed to resolve the citizenship problem.  He was also told that a new completed and correctly declared form and new witnessed photographs were required.  These were brought to the Passport Office in Balbriggan on 12 April, 2013.  The additional information and the new form were sufficient to issue a passport.  However, there was not sufficient time to enter this new material into the automated passport system to produce a full passport that day.  An emergency passport was, therefore, issued to the applicant in order to facilitate the family&rsquo;s travel plan for 15 April, 2013. </p><p>  In the meantime, the application has been finalised and a passport has been produced.  The Passport Office in Balbriggan has made further contact with the applicant&rsquo;s parents to arrange the return of the valid emergency passport for cancellation and the issue of the applicant&rsquo;s full passport.</p></reply>

The remainder consisted of development contributions made through other Government Departments, and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.  Funding under the Government&rsquo;s aid programme was provided for long term development programmes and emergency humanitarian assistance in some of the poorest countries and communities in the world.  In 2012 the programme continued to prioritise the fight against global poverty and hunger, delivering targeted investments in the areas of education, health, good governance, food security and nutrition.</p><p>Funding under Vote 27 was delivered through trusted partners including UN Agencies, International Development Organisations, Non Governmental Organisations and Irish Missionary Organisations.  The table below provides a listing of grants in excess of &euro;1.0 million provided to those organisations from the Department&rsquo;s headquarters in 2012.  In addition, approximately one third of the Irish Aid programme was managed through our Embassies in Programme Countries, where we implement long term, strategic development partnership programmes.  In 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s Programme Countries were Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa, and Timor Leste and Vietnam in Asia.  Full details of this expenditure are currently being compiled for the Irish Aid annual report and will be available later in the year on the Irish Aid website, at www.irishaid.ie.</p><p><table><tr><th>Organisation Name </th><th>In &euro; Millions  </th></tr><tr><td>United Nations Development Programme </td><td><div>     30.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Concern Worldwide</td><td><div>     23.43 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Tr&oacute;caire </td><td><div>     18.47 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The World Bank </td><td><div>     10.39 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Misean Cara </td><td><div>     16.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>GOAL</td><td><div>     14.70 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Children's Fund - UNICEF</td><td><div>     10.25 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria</td><td><div>     11.80 </div></td></tr><tr><td>World Food Programme </td><td><div>     11.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund</td><td><div>     10.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Committee of the Red Cross  </td><td><div>       8.80 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees </td><td><div>       8.40 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East</td><td><div>       6.34 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Labour Organisation</td><td><div>       5.95 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs </td><td><div>       4.56 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS  - UNAIDS </td><td><div>       3.48 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Oxfam Ireland </td><td><div>       3.30 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies </td><td><div>       3.28 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Population Fund </td><td><div>       3.23 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Christian Aid Ireland </td><td><div>       4.02 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Plan Ireland </td><td><div>       3.02 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Self Help Africa </td><td><div>       2.90 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization </td><td><div>       2.75 </div></td></tr><tr><td>World Vision Ireland </td><td><div>       2.73 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Irish Fair Trade Network</td><td><div>       2.66 </div></td></tr><tr><td>World Health Organisation </td><td><div>       2.30 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International AIDS Vaccine Initiative</td><td><div>       2.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Fund for Agricultural Development </td><td><div>       2.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Medicines for Malaria Venture </td><td><div>       2.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</td><td><div>       1.95 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women</td><td><div>       1.73 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Halo Trust</td><td><div>       1.64 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sight Savers International </td><td><div>       1.57 </div></td></tr><tr><td>M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res</td><td><div>       1.03 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This decision was taken in light of the political and economic reforms that have been taking place in Myanmar/Burma since 2011 in the process of democratisation, and further to the Council&rsquo;s decision to suspend sanctions in April 2012.  Member States and nationals of Member States are prohibited from the sale, supply, transfer or export of arms and related materials to Myanmar/Burma.  EU Member States are also prohibited from financing or providing financial assistance to military activities in Myanmar/Burma.</p><p>  Ireland and our EU partners recognise that Myanmar/Burma still faces complex challenges in terms of democratisation, economic development, human rights, and peace and reconciliation.  In keeping with this, the recent decision taken at the Foreign Affairs Council will apply until the 30 April 2014.  The decision will be kept under constant review and shall be renewed, or amended as appropriate. </p></reply>

However, when I became aware of the misappropriation of Irish funds in October 2012, I immediately suspended over &euro;16 million of assistance which was due to be channelled through Government of Uganda systems.  The final outturn for the Uganda aid programme in 2012 was &euro;15.54 million.  An interim Aid Programme for Uganda has been put in place for 2013 with a budget of &euro;16.4 million. This programme is built around support for projects which operate through non-government systems, most of which involve the continuation of existing programmes and commitments, together with some elements where existing support through Government systems can be replaced with bilateral arrangements.  This includes direct support to the Ugandan Office of the Auditor General.</p><p>  The promotion and safeguarding of human rights, particularly those of minority groups, is a central element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  I share the widespread concerns about the difficult situation faced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Uganda. I am particularly concerned about developments in relation to the so-called Anti-Homosexuality Bill.  Ireland, together with our EU partners and other international donors in Uganda, has engaged actively on the issue of this draft legislation since it first arose in 2009.  The draft Bill was re-introduced in 2012, but has not yet been formally tabled in Parliament. The position of the Government of Uganda on the proposed law is that it was presented as a private member&rsquo;s bill and is not part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  President Museveni and the Cabinet have publicly stated that the Bill is unnecessary.  He has also made a commitment to engage members of Parliament on the implications of this Bill for Uganda&rsquo;s international relations and reputation.  </p><p>  I raised the issue directly with President Museveni when I visited Uganda last July and our Ambassador in Kampala has also continued to follow developments closely.  She and other EU Ambassadors have outlined our serious concerns in several meetings at the highest levels in Uganda.  The Ugandan Government and other interested parties are in no doubt about the Irish Government&rsquo;s profound concerns on this issue.  Ireland, in conjunction with our EU partners and the wider donor community, remains committed to ensuring that citizens of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Our Embassy in Uganda will continue to monitor the issue closely over the coming months and to work with partners who are equally concerned to promote respect for these rights.</p></reply>

It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  The Bill is a very positive development which, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  </p><p>  Both of these issues have been a key focus of my ongoing engagement with political leaders in the US, particularly during my visit to Washington D.C. over St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when I discussed them with Ireland&rsquo;s key friends on Capitol Hill and in the Administration.  The Government has maintained close contact since publication of the Bill with the key players through our Embassy in Washington.  I am conscious that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system and that much further debate is likely to be required before the final shape of any overall legislation becomes clear. </p><p>  The plight of the undocumented remains a top priority for Government and we have worked closely with the bi-partisan group of Senators and other legislators in the run-up to the publication of this Bill.  The Government will continue to liaise closely with them and other key stakeholders in Congress and throughout the Irish-American community.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-23a.186.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300058#WRD01700"><p>There are currently 4 million people in desperate need of the basic means of survival. Over 2 million Syrians are displaced inside the country, their homes and communities destroyed and uninhabitable. More than 1.3 million people are now taking refuge in neighbouring countries after fleeing the hostilities. Despite serious risks and constraints on their operations, humanitarian workers are entering into these Syrian communities each day to reach the most vulnerable with life-saving assistance. </p><p>  Children have been particularly affected by the crisis. It is estimated that some 2 million children inside Syria are in need of immediate assistance, with many requiring medical attention and psychosocial support. More than 4,000 schools have been destroyed or are no longer operational, and hundreds of thousands of children are being denied a basic education. One out of every two refugees from the conflict is a child.  </p><p>  When I visited al-Zaatari refugee camp on the Syria-Jordan border last August, all the refugees I spoke to were clear that eland&rsquo;s assistance was greatly needed. Although Syria&rsquo;s neighbours, including Jordan, were making a major effort to support Syrians affected by the crisis, they were already under strain because of the scale of the challenge and the steady escalation of needs. Earlier this month, the T&aacute;naiste visited refugee camps in southern Turkey and witnessed the major humanitarian effort underway there to support Syrian refugees. This visit further confirmed our belief that the international community has a duty to move immediately to help protect the lives and dignity of the beleaguered Syrian population. eland has responded generously to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries.  To date, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has provided over &euro;8.15 million in humanitarian assistance.  This has been channelled through long-standing and reputable partners such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the UN Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).   They have a demonstrated track record of effective humanitarian response in Syria, with strong strategies for targeting and delivery and robust systems for monitoring and accountability.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s humanitarian support is allocated through the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund managed by ish Aid. The specific objective of this fund is to save and protect lives in acute crisis situations on the basis of independently assessed humanitarian needs.

This does not, however, preclude the development of economic and trade relations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, sees the benefit of encouraging trade with Taiwan, and continues to explore appropriate opportunities which arise.  This does not, however, preclude the development of economic and trade relations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, sees the benefit of encouraging trade with Taiwan, and continues to explore appropriate opportunities which arise.</p><p>  As the Deputy has noted, IDA Ireland had an office in Taipei but closed it following a reorganisation of resources in 2011.  Enterprise Ireland and the IDA currently assess that, given the competing demands on limited resources, they can best manage the needs of their clients in China, including those in Taiwan, from their offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzen.  Decisions regarding the presence of an Irish State Agencies in Taipei are matters for the Agencies concerned.</p><p>  The European Union has no formal diplomatic or political relations with Taiwan.  The EU does, however, recognise Taiwan as an economic and commercial entity and is represented by the European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) in Taipei, which was established in 2003.  A number of EU partner countries also have Trade Offices there.</p><p>  Irish business and other representatives travelling to Taipei on trade promotion and investment activities are free to liaise with the EETO and to welcome any assistance which might be offered by that office, in addition to the support provided by the Irish State Agencies in China.  </p><p>  In terms of the possibility of concluding a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) with Taiwan, this matter is currently being considered by the relevant Government Departments and agencies.  Ireland has a DTA with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China which entered into force in December 2001.  Since the conclusion of the DTA with China, a separate agreement was agreed with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (HKSAR) and entered into force in February 2011.  However, the situation in Hong Kong is different to Taiwan as Hong Kong&rsquo;s separate taxation status is specifically provided for in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as adopted by the National People&rsquo;s Congress in Beijing in 1997.</p></reply>

The LPT is a self-assessed tax and it is incorrect to describe the general issue of LPT Returns and supporting documentation by Revenue as demands for LPT.  In accordance with the legislation, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the amount of LPT due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The level of household income, or the number of residents in the household, has no bearing on the amount of LPT due.</p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it is made in good faith, will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period. A system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers is available, one of which is dependent on the level of the owner's annual income. Where a property owner qualifies for deferral, interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum and the deferred amount, including the interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  Details of all the deferral options are available in Revenue's Guide to Local Property Tax which was issued to property owners and to Oireachtas Members and is also on Revenue's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of the general issue of Returns and booklets, which has been ongoing since last month and is almost concluded, property owners also received a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  Revenue has made it clear that the Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner's individual property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that the owner should pay.   The Estimate is only relevant where an owner does not make his or her self-assessment of the market value and complete and file his or her LPT Return. </p><p>  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral will be &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not &#8220;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&#8221; exceed these thresholds in that year.  An increased gross income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. </p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&euro;25,000 single, &euro;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.</p></reply>

I should point out that the latest OECD data indicates that Ireland has the most progressive tax system of the EU members of its organisation. A progressive taxation system ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay.</p><p>  In addition, the marginal tax rate, which is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the base, is an important consideration in the formulation of tax policy.  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more.  The OECD in its working paper &amp;#8216;Tax and Economic Growth'  points to the <i>&#8220;possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&#8221;</i>  .  </p><p>  The top marginal tax rate for employees, including USC and PRSI, is now 52%. This has increased from 43.5% in 2008. The top marginal tax rate for self-assessed is now 55%. This has increased from 46.5% in 2008.  It is estimated that in 2013, the top 5 per cent of income earners will pay 44 per cent of the total income tax yield, while it is estimated that those earning &euro;50,000 or less, which represents 78 per cent of income earners, will pay 20 per cent of the total income tax yield.  It is further estimated that in 2013, 841,000 individuals, which represents approximately 40 per cent of the income tax base, will be exempt from income tax altogether.  </p><p>  The issue of public service pay and other expenditure policy is primarily a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. However, in view of the Unions' non acceptance of the measures proposed by the Labour Relations Commission to achieve reductions in the public service pay bill, it will now be necessary for the Government to decide on and secure alternative measures that will deliver the savings to meet our expenditure targets.</p></reply>

These staff play an important part in ensuring compliance with all taxes and duties as well as with customs obligations (including drugs interdiction)</p><p>  Revenue is subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009.

The tax return should be used by the individual to declare all of their income sources, including payments from the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  This obligation to file a tax return does not generally apply to an individual where all of that individual&rsquo;s income, including payments from the DSP, is taxed under the PAYE system.  In the case of a person taxed under the PAYE system, they are obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners of any other source of income, including benefit payments from the DSP.  That notification can be made in writing or the person can contact one of Revenue&rsquo;s PAYE lo-call numbers with the details.</p><p>  A person&rsquo;s particular circumstances determine whether they are liable to pay tax on any DSP payments.  For example, they may have no other sources of income and therefore are unlikely to be liable for tax on their DSP payments. However, regardless of the type of DSP payment involved the person should still notify the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that they have no other obligations.  Similarly, increases or decreases in the amount of payment made by the DSP should be notified to Revenue.  I am further informed that while there are significant data exchange arrangements in place between Revenue and the DSP, it is still the recipient&rsquo;s responsibility to notify Revenue that they are receiving payments from the Department.</p></reply>

Fuel laundering imposes significant costs on the community and poses a serious threat to tax yield and to legitimate businesses.  As part of its strategy to curb illegal activity in this area, Revenue strengthened licensing requirements for traders in auto fuels in 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  A new licensing requirement was introduced for traders in marked fuel oil from 1 October 2012 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.  In addition, Revenue introduced new supply chain controls requiring all licensed fuel retailers to make monthly returns to Revenue, from 1 January 2013, of their fuel transactions, which will provide assurance about the distribution of all fuels and identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and distribution patterns.</p><p>  In the period 2011 to 2012, over 2 million litres of fuel was seized, 20 fuel laundries were detected and closed and 89 filling stations were closed because they were unlicensed or in breach of licensing conditions.</p><p>  In view of the links between organised criminals and the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement agencies.  A Cross-Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, involving all relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland, facilitates co-operation among these agencies in dealing with the illegal fuel trade.  Arising from its work, a number of groups operating in both jurisdictions and involved in the production and distribution of laundered diesel, have been targeted for investigation.</p><p>  In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom are pursuing jointly a new and more effective fuel marker for common use in both jurisdictions.  A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed in 2012 by Revenue and HMRC and work on the project is proceeding.  A joint &lsquo;Invitation to Make Submissions&rsquo; (IMS), which issued in June 2012, generated international interest and twelve submissions were received by the closing date.  These submissions are being evaluated jointly at present by Revenue and HMRC on the basis of agreed scientific, legal and operational criteria.</p><p>  The question of introducing a rebate scheme for users of marked gas oil has been addressed in previous parliamentary debates.  A change to a system of this nature would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system and would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  Marked gas oil has a wide range of uses such as the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range of users.  In addition, repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.</p></reply>

A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue in this regard was the development of a register of residential properties in the State.  The register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  Data from the various sources were cross-checked to ensure that the register is as accurate as possible.  The register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine it.</p><p>  I am informed that, while every effort has been made to correctly match residential properties to owners, in a small percentage of cases the register contains duplicate entries for a single address.  Where a property owner receives a duplicate Return in respect of a single property it is important that neither of the returns is ignored.  The owner should file the correct return and advise Revenue of the duplicate either in writing or by contacting the Revenue LPT helpline at 1890 200 255.  No supporting documentation is required in order to remove a duplicate entry from the LPT Register.  I am advised that the property owner in question has already contacted Revenue and the duplicate property in question has now been removed from the LPT Register.</p></reply>

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:</p><p>1.  An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p>2.  An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.</p><p>3.  An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.</p><p>4.  An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.</p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned.</p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection.  The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work.  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income.  It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.</p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed.</p></reply>

The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides two potential measures of relief from Local Property Tax (LPT) for persons who have a disability.  Section 10B provides an exemption for permanently incapacitated individuals while section 15A provides for a reduction in chargeable value for properties adapted for use by disabled persons.  Section 10B of the Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.</p><p>  Where an exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may in certain circumstances qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property.  Section 15A of the Act provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.

In this regard, the Revenue Commissioners have carried out a review of deductions in the year 2012 and an overpayment of &euro;9.16 has arisen. A refund for this amount will now issue.</p></reply>

The appointment of the Special Liquidators is a compensation event under Regulation 8A(1) of the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 1995 (SI No. 168 of 1995) (the &ldquo;DGS Regulations&rdquo;).  The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for operating the DGS scheme.  The Special Liquidators were directed by the Central Bank to provide the necessary information and assistance to allow duly verified, eligible depositors to be compensated up to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per eligible depositor.  I have been advised that in order to verify eligibility, the Special Liquidators must establish that there are no legal rights of set-off of deposits against other liabilities.  The Special Liquidators are continuing to work through the process of assessing these set-off rights.  The Special Liquidators are unable at this point to say when all cases will be resolved.</p><p>  In order to be eligible, a small company must be a private limited company satisfying at least two of the following three conditions in respect of the last two financial years: the balance sheet total does not exceed &euro;4.4 million; the amount of turnover for that year does not exceed &euro;8.8 million; the average numbers of persons employed by the company does not exceed 50.  These criteria are set out in Section 8 of the Companies Act 1986.</p><p>  In addition, the nature of the company&rsquo;s business must not fall within the excluded categories such as financial institution, insurer etc.  The Central Bank wrote to all companies that held accounts in IBRC, requesting directors to certify that the company qualifies to be treated as a small company.  The position as at 19 April 2013 was: Small Company Claim forms issued to company account holders - 774; Small Company claim forms returned - 124; Of which: Paid - 4; Being investigated by the Central Bank (e.g. unlimited company, dormant company) - 4; Still being assessed for right of set off by Special Liquidator - 116; No reply received - 650.</p><p>  The Central Bank will make compensation payments to eligible depositors at the earliest possible date (within five working days) following verification by the Special Liquidators.</p></reply>

The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau has long held the position that the public interest would be served by having the ability to publish information on the complaints record of individual Financial Service Providers.  The Bureau&rsquo;s review of international best practice has confirmed this.  Consumers will be able to analyse the performance of all financial service providers before making a decision.</p><p>  I intend to bring forward an amendment at Committee Stage of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 to provide the Financial Services Ombudsman with the power to name, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, financial service providers about which the Financial Services Ombudsman has upheld or substantially upheld complaints.  The Ombudsman was consulted during the drafting process and is aware of the Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard.</p></reply>

On this basis, a number of providers, including BlackRock, were admitted to the framework agreement.  The most economic advantageous tender per lot (the company who scored the highest) won the immediate piece of work. The award notice was published on   <i>www.etenders.gov.ie/.</i></p><p>  As part of the FMP, the CBI is currently developing asset class loan loss forecast models which can be used as part of PCAR. As part of these services, these independent models will be validated by BlackRock (BRS).  In addition, BRS are developing the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) asset class model for the CBI. It is therefore expected that this engagement will be completed by end-June 2013.  The Framework Agreement is valid for four years.  For any future FMP or PCAR requirements throughout the duration of the framework agreement, each firm who has been successful in the particular lot will be invited to participate in a mini-competition if external providers are required.  It has not yet been decided whether third party support is required or needed for any stress testing that may be conducted in 2013.  Therefore it is not possible to provide an estimated cost of stress-testing the Irish banks for 2013.</p></reply>

It can only happen in very narrowly defined situations.  A person, whose mortgage on their home or on a rental property, for example, is partly written-off, will not suffer any income tax charge on the write-off. </p><p>  Since 1970, the income tax code provides for the write-off of trade debts to be treated as a receipt of income in the year of write-off. However, carried-forward losses in the trade up to that time can be set against that income and may well reduce the charge to zero.  This applies to all traders and professionals, whether in insolvency or not.  This year's Finance Act (section 18) introduced a similar provision relating to the write-off of loans used to acquire and develop land as part of a trade of land dealing or development. The new provision operates in the same way as the 1970 provision but is even more restricted in that it only applies to land dealers and developers.  From an income tax point of view, the consequences of debt write-off are exactly the same, whether insolvency is involved or not.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Commissioners, that within the past month, they have made it clear, publicly, that where for bona fide commercial reasons, a financial institution enters into a debt restructuring, forgiveness or write-off arrangement with a customer, then Revenue's approach is to accept that the financial institution is not intent on making a gift to the debtor and, consequently, no charge to Capital Acquisitions Tax will arise.  However, where the bona fides of such arrangements are open to question or tax avoidance is involved, then this approach does not apply.</p><p>  There are no<b></b>capital gains tax or value added tax implications associated with any benefit that might arise to a debtor from the writing-down or writing-off of a debt under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  In summary, I can say that in the majority of cases of personal insolvency, which may involve mortgage default on family homes and which will come within the ambit of the new Personal Insolvency Act 2012, there will be no tax consequences of any kind.</p></reply>

The residual NAMA residential stock is being actively marketed for rent or sale by NAMA debtors and receivers at market prices or has been made available for social housing or is currently being marketed under the Agency's 80/20 Deferred Payment Initiative. According to the most recent Census there are over 320,000 private rental properties in the country. Therefore, the scale of NAMA's vacant homes is not large enough to distort the market.</p></reply>

Specifically:</p><p> - the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by 15 October each year;</p><p> - draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all Euro area Member States not in a programme of assistance; and</p><p> - the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by 31 December each year.</p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government has decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before 15 October from now on. This means that Budget 2014 will be presented and published on Tuesday, 15 October this year.  The Government has also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by 31 December each year. This timeline will be considerably shorter than the present requirement that it must be enacted within 120 days of the Budget. Under the new arrangements, the Finance Bill will have to be passed 65 to 70 days after the Budget.</p><p>  Following the Government decision on the timing of the budget, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are considering the follow-on implications of moving both Budget Day and the Finance Bill forward. However, the key change relates to the timing and, as I have stated before, it means that Government will have to make its budgetary decisions much earlier in the year. It is the intention of both Departments to keep all bodies that contribute to the Budget and Finance Bill processes fully informed of changes so that they can plan accordingly.</p><p>  There is another requirement in the "two-pack", namely that the macroeconomic forecasts on which the Budget is based must be independently endorsed. Implementation of this requirement is still under consideration.  As regards documents to be published antecedent to the delivery of Budget 2014, the Stability Programme Update will be published by the end of April, as usual. It has been normal practice in the last few years to publish a medium-term fiscal statement or equivalent in October/November. As this overlaps with the new budgetary timetable, this is likely to be consolidated into the budget publication from now on. The requirements regarding the White Paper on Expenditure and Receipts have not been altered by these changes.</p><p>  Finally, the Government will decide later in the budgetary process whether to submit a draft budgetary plan in the common format as Ireland is exempt from this requirement because it is in a programme.</p></reply>

In a very limited number of cases where it employs staff with very marketable skills on short fixed-term contracts, it includes contract completion payments as part of the contract as an incentive to the employee concerned to serve the full term of the contract.  No member of the NTMA senior management team has such an arrangement in their contract. These fixed-term contracts should not be confused with the specified purpose contracts under which employees assigned to NAMA are employed and which do not include such contract completion payments.</p></reply>

NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA. Under section 42 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA. All relevant NTMA employees agreed to waive such amounts during 2012.  I am informed by the NTMA that thirteen of its 522 employees fall within this category. Ten of these &ndash; including the Chief Executives of the NTMA, NAMA and the NDFA and the other six members of the NTMA senior management team - are continuing to waive such amounts.</p><p>  With regard to the Croke Park 2 proposals, following the rejection by the Public Services Committee of Congress of the LRC proposals on a successor agreement to Croke Park, the Government will reflect on the outcome of the ballot and the manner in which the required payroll savings can be achieved this year. In that context it would be premature to comment on the way in which any proposed measures may affect a particular group of employees.</p></reply>

In the specific case of KBC Ireland, the bank is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Credit Institution in the Republic of Ireland.  In addition its parent, KBC Group, is profitable and has a strong liquidity position and the Group is currently providing the necessary capital and liquidity to its Irish subsidiary.  These are challenging times for the whole banking sector in Ireland, not just for the domestic banks. KBC Ireland is an important provider of credit to the Irish housing market and as the Deputy rightly points out the Bank has extended some &euro;14 billion of credit to the Irish economy. This is a very significant investment in Ireland, predominantly in the residential mortgage market.</p><p>  It should be noted that KBC Ireland anticipate that increasing economic stability will lead to more sustainable conditions in 2013 with the bank hoping for reduced credit costs in the year ahead.  I welcome KBC Group&rsquo;s commitment to the Irish market and note that they are planning to develop their business in Ireland further with new retail branches and distribution platforms to be rolled out in 2013 and continued expansion of their retail product portfolio.  This will add welcome competition in the retail banking market in Ireland.</p><p>  In the first quarter of 2013 the parent company invested &euro;125m in its Irish subsidiary to support on-going business development.  In April KBC Ireland opened a new high street retail office in Cork, which is its first new office outside of Dublin.

Nor can NAMA preclude debtors from engaging with such potential purchasers. To do either would be counterproductive and could stifle normal commercial discussions in the property market and in particular could discourage international investors from exploring acquisition possibilities in Ireland.  However, NAMA has very clear rules regarding the open marketing of loans or of properties on which it holds security.</p><p>  As set out in response to recent Parliamentary Questions on the topic of NAMA loan sales [44286/12, 44287/12, 44288/12, 44189/12, 1549/13, 8753/13, 8754/13], NAMA has adopted a very thorough approach in line with accepted international market best practice for the sale of loan portfolios.  As part of the formal sales process, potential purchasers are required to provide an undertaking that they will not engage with the debtor or other obligors at any stage during the sales process. Both debtors and potential purchasers are aware that the infringement of agreed protocols or undertakings may have an impact on NAMA&rsquo;s decisions as to whether and to whom it sells a particularly portfolio.  Furthermore, where NAMA approves the sale of any loan or approves the sale of any secured property by a debtor, it requires a confirmation that the purchaser is not connected to the debtor or other obligors.</p><p>  Having ensured, as far as possible, that the sales process is conducted on the basis of all parties having equal access to the necessary information at the same time and that such primary sales are not made to the relevant debtors or to connected parties, NAMA advises that it has no legal right to intervene in any further future management or sales of the loan or underlying property in question post disposal.</p></reply>

According to this ECB Press Release, the purpose of OMT is: &ldquo;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&rdquo; </p><p>  This press statement sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases. The ECB have also stated that OMT may also be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme &ldquo;when they will be regaining bond market access&rdquo;.  The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  The decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is therefore a matter for the ECB.</p><p>  I believe the ECB&rsquo;s announcement regarding its OMT programme is a significant development and is viewed as such by the financial markets.  I also note Mr Draghi&rsquo;s comments that one of the reasons why the ECB&rsquo;s OMT scheme is successful &ldquo;was because governments made significant progress in undertaking both fiscal consolidation and, in some cases, structural reforms.&rdquo; </p><p>  We are now in the final year of our EU IMF programme and our focus is now firmly fixed on a successful and durable exit from the programme.  The recent highly successful sale of long term bonds by NTMA is another very significant step in this process.  We continue to assess a number of options in this regard. However, we must respect the fact that the decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is a matter for the ECB, which is an independent body.</p></reply>

There are clearly lessons to be learnt from this analysis of the decline of HBOS particularly as the Report makes it clear that to an extent its dramatic demise was &lsquo;an accident waiting to happen&rsquo; and it in this context senior management and the Financial Services Authority failed to follow through on the implications of its high risk growth strategy despite the fact that this was signalled as early as 2004.</p><p>  The Report clearly highlights failures at a number of levels &ndash; the senior management of the bank, the internal risk control, at the regulatory level and within the financial markets.  As set out in the Report in relation to the HBOS failure whilst structural and regulatory reform at national and European level are key to future financial stability it does not diminish the need for appropriate management and supervision of traditional banking activities.  The case of HBOS also highlights that prudential supervisors cannot rely on financial markets to do their work for them as neither the stakeholders nor rating agencies exerted the effective pressure that might have acted as a constraint upon the flawed strategy of the bank. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the situation in relation to the Irish banking system has been the subject of reports and analysis by Honohan, Nyberg and Regling and Watson.  The Government continues the process of addressing the regulatory failures of the past.  This week the Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Bill will be debated at Committee Stage.  This Bill further enhances the supervisory and regulatory framework under which financial institutions in Ireland will operate into the future.  Separately this will be complemented by the enhancement of the supervisory framework at the EU level, and as the Deputy will be aware, much progress has been made on this agenda during the course of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union.</p></reply>

Many borrowers with home mortgage arrears also have significant other debts (including investment properties and personal debts such as credit union, credit card or bank loans).

The targets are set in relation to both Principal Dwelling Homes and Buy to Let mortgages.  Performance targets have been set for: ACC; AIB; Bank of Ireland; KBC Bank Ireland; Permanent TSB; and Ulster Bank.  The Central Bank has advised that these institutions cover the vast majority of the mortgage book in Ireland, accounting for around 90% of mortgages held and that it will examine whether it should extend the targets to other mortgage lenders in due course.  The Central Bank also continues to engage with all regulated lenders to ensure that adequate mortgage arrears resolution strategies are in place.</p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears remains a key protection for those cooperating mortgage holders who are in difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Code provides, inter alia, that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim, as far as possible, at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty having regard to the specific circumstances in individual cases.  In particular, the Code provides that a lender&rsquo;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including:</p><p>  - the personal circumstances of the borrower;</p><p>  - the overall indebtedness of the borrower;</p><p>  - the information provided in the standard financial statement (SFS);</p><p>  - the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity, and</p><p>  - the borrower&rsquo;s previous history.</p><p>  The Code, which applies to all mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except Credit Unions, operating in the State, is currently being reviewed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The public consultation process has been completed and the Central Bank expects to publish the revised Code before the end of May.</p><p>  Separately from this Central Bank action, the new personal insolvency system, in particular the new resolution frameworks provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act, will also shortly be available to borrowers who are in significant difficulty in their mortgage repayments.  Utilising this process, the borrower will be in a position to consult an independent personal insolvency practitioner and where necessary to make a formal and realistic personal insolvency arrangement proposal to all eligible creditors, including a mortgage lender.  In such a situation the creditors will be obliged to formally consider and vote on the arrangement as proposed by the debtor.  In the event of a refusal by creditors, the debtor will also have access to the reformed bankruptcy framework, which has significantly reduced automatic discharge period to three years.  I would also remind the Deputy that, under the mortgage advisory service developed by the Department of Social Protection, independent financial advice is available to borrowers who have been offered a long term forbearance option by the lender and a panel of around 2,000 qualified accountants is now in place to provide this service.</p></reply>

However, I have been informed by the Central Bank that Section 121 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 permits a mortgage lender to apply an early redemption fee in certain circumstances, which includes breaking a fixed rate contract. </p><p>  The Central Bank has indicated to me that when credit institutions provide fixed rate mortgages to customers, they utilise wholesale funding at a fixed rate to match the fixed credit they provide to customers.  If interest rates fall, credit providers may be locked into accessing wholesale market credit at a higher rate than they can charge consumers in the retail market.  As a result, a cost arises which is covered through the charging of a break cost. In the current environment, interest rates have fallen and as a result there is a differential between the interest rate that the credit provider has locked into for the funds supplied to customers and what they can charge to customers, for the remaining period of the fixed rate loan.</p></reply>

Funds in the Exchequer are used for all the ongoing payments necessary for running the State, which include debt redemptions.  While the Exchequer had &euro;28.5 billion on hand in cash and deposits at end-March, there was a &euro;4.6 billion large bond redemption on 18 April which has since reduced the cash position.</p><p>  The State earns a return on these.  NTMA manages the Exchequer cash balances and deposits, which the NTMA manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the progress made in stabilising and improving the public finances it remains the case that the State will continue to run large, though declining Exchequer deficits in the coming years.  For example, <i>Budget 2013</i> estimated the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2015 at close to &euro;35 billion.  While the sale of the Bank of Ireland contingent capital notes, sale of Irish Life and the replacement of the IBRC Promissory Note with long-term Government bonds will help to reduce this requirement, it will nonetheless remain significant.  In addition to these day-to-day costs and as referred to above, the Exchequer must have sufficient resources to repay debt redemptions, including the recent &euro;4.6 billion Government bond repayment on 18 April and a &euro;7.6 billion Government bond repayment in mid-January 2014.  The continuing Exchequer deficits and debt redemptions must be adequately and prudently funded.</p><p>  Decisions on the level of cash reserves, which are a matter for the NTMA, take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves.  These factors include considering the potential risks cost of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance.  This includes, including the  and the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market interest rates would possibly be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position.</p><p>  The State is well positioned to have 12-15 months of advance funding in place when the EU/IMF Programme comes to a conclusion at the end of 2013, a level of funding which the Troika have noted in their recent reports on Ireland's progress in implementing the terms of the Programme of assistance.  It is necessary, for reasons of prudence and to assure investors that they will be repaid upon redemption, that the Exchequer maintains a sufficiently strong cash position at year end.</p></reply>

The investigation commenced on 1 September 2009 and a qualifying disclosure initiative was launched within the parameters of the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit.  This initiative required persons with undeclared tax liabilities, in respect of settlements on trusts and other structures, to make a disclosure and pay the related tax, interest and penalty liabilities by 31 October 2009.  Under the Code of Practice details of persons who made such a qualifying disclosure and paid the liabilities are not publishable in Revenue&rsquo;s quarterly list of tax defaulters.  Details of persons who did not make a qualifying disclosure but who were subsequently found, following investigations by Revenue, to have a liability, are publishable in the normal way in the list of tax defaulters, subject to the case meeting the criteria applying to publication as a tax defaulter.

This is also conditional on continued successful programme implementation being confirmed by the Troika together with the 9th review of the Irish adjustment programme and the 7th review of the Portuguese programme.  The 9th review of Ireland&rsquo;s programme has now completed all approval stages by both the IMF and the EU.</p><p>The Ministers also noted that the extension would smooth the debt redemption profile of both countries and lower their refinancing needs in the post-programme period.  The detailed implementation of the extension remains to be agreed. The effect of this will depend on the mix of loans extended and the maturities involved. This will be agreed between the NTMA, the EFSF and the EFSM.</p><p>Given the above, the table below (the information in which is available on the NTMA&rsquo;s website) shows only the existing maturity of EFSF and EFSM loans.  The bilateral loans are not affected by this agreement.</p><p>The interest rates for the EU facilities are already provided at or close to their cost of funds, and these rates are not affected by this decision on maturities.In terms of the EFSF, &euro;6.7 billion of Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans are at fixed interest rates which were based on matched EFSF bond/loan structures.  As a result of changes to the EFSF&rsquo;s structure which removed the direct link between specific bond issues and programme countries, the balance of Ireland&rsquo;s disbursed EFSF loans, currently &euro;5.5 billion, are part of a pooled system whereby all programme countries pay the same interest rate.  The pooled interest rate is calculated daily and is based on the EFSF&rsquo;s cost of funds in managing the pool.  This can be characterised as the weighted average cost of its bond and bill issuance. As at 31 March 2013 the blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans was 2.66%.</p><p>Exceptionally, Ireland has one EFSF loan tranche of &euro;1.27 billion which is considered to be part of the pool but has a fixed interest rate until February 2015, at which point it will roll at the pooled interest rate.</p><p>The effective interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSM loans is based on the EFSM&rsquo;s cost of funds when it issues bonds. Such issuance is matched against the loans. Some of its matched issuance can be spread across both Ireland and Portugal.  As at 31 March 2013, the blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSM loans was 3.10%.</p><p>As at 31 March 2013, the overall blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s programme loans was 3.32%.</p><p><b>EFSF/EFSM Liabilities Outstanding at end-March 2013</b></p><p><pcenter><b>Liabilities outstanding at end March 2013 on EFSF/EFSM loans</b></pcenter><table><tr><th><div><b>Lender</b></div></th><th><div><b>Nominal Loan Amount*</b></div></th><th><div><b>Date  of Draw Down</b></div></th><th><div><b>Maturity Date</b></div></th><th><div><b>Term from Date of Drawdown</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)</div></td><td><div>EUR 5.00 billion</div></td><td><div>12-Jan-11</div></td><td><div>04-Dec-15</div></td><td><div>4.9 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.40 billion</div></td><td><div>24-Mar-11</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-18</div></td><td><div>7.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.00 billion</div></td><td><div>31-May-11</div></td><td><div>04-Jun-21</div></td><td><div>10.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 2.00 billion</div></td><td><div>29-Sep-11</div></td><td><div>04-Sep-26</div></td><td><div>14.9 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 0.50 billion</div></td><td><div>06-Oct-11</div></td><td><div>04-Oct-18</div></td><td><div>7.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.50 billion</div></td><td><div>16-Jan-12</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-42</div></td><td><div>30.2 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.00 billion</div></td><td><div>05-Mar-12</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-32</div></td><td><div>20.1 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 2.30 billion</div></td><td><div>03-Jul-12</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-28</div></td><td><div>15.8 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.00 billion</div></td><td><div>30-Oct-12</div></td><td><div>04-Nov-27</div></td><td><div>15.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b><i>EFSM EUR Equivalent Total</i></b></div></td><td><div><b><i>&euro;21.70 billion</i></b></div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div><b><i>12.4 yrs weighted average life</i></b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)</div></td><td><div>EUR 4.19 billion**</div></td><td><div>01-Feb-11</div></td><td><div>18-Jul-16</div></td><td><div>5.5 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.00 billion</div></td><td><div>14-Nov-11</div></td><td><div>04-Feb-22</div></td><td><div>10.2 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.27 billion</div></td><td><div>12-Jan-12</div></td><td><div>04-Feb-15</div></td><td><div>3.1 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 2.80 billion</div></td><td><div>03-Apr-12</div></td><td><div>03-Apr-37</div></td><td><div>25.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 0.48 billion</div></td><td><div>19-Jul-12</div></td><td><div>19-Jul-41</div></td><td><div>29.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.00 billion</div></td><td><div>23-Aug-12</div></td><td><div>23-Aug-19</div></td><td><div>7.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b><i>EFSF EUR Equivalent Total</i></b></div></td><td><div><b><i>&euro;12.74 billion</i></b></div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div><b><i>11.7 yrs weighted average life</i></b></div></td></tr></table></p><p>Notes :</p><p>Rounding can affect totals.</p><p>* Euro equivalents are translated at the reporting date exchange rates, taking account of the effect of currency hedging transactions.

The Act also provides that owners of multiple properties must file their LPT returns online.  A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive register of residential properties in the State.  This register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to ensure, as far as possible, that all property owners will be contacted.  The process to issue LPT Returns and supplementary information to the owners of in excess of 1.62 million residential properties has been ongoing since last month and is almost complete.</p><p>  However, LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore liable persons are obliged to calculate the tax due based on their assessment of the market value of their property, file their return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  This obligation applies to all owners whether or not they receive a return form from Revenue.  They should contact the LPT helpline at 1890 200 255 or they can login to LPT online at <i>www.revenue.ie</i> and file a return by clicking on the &quot;I have not received a Property Pin&quot; tab. </p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that Revenue has provided a wide range of payment options for LPT, including payment by instalments by direct debit or deduction at source.  The closing date of 7 May for paper filing of LPT Returns has been chosen with a view to the logistics of ensuring that the chosen payment option can be activated in good time for the July payment dates.  The e-filing closing date of 28 May is the de facto extension to the filing date for paper LPT Returns.  The online system is secure and user friendly, with built in calculators and easy access to guidance.</p><p>  For property owners for whom e-filing is not practical, the legislation provides that another person may file on their behalf, and Revenue has made it clear on several occasions that they can visit their local Revenue office where computers and assistance to e-file will be available.  In addition, Revenue has made arrangements for property owners to pay and file by telephone via the LPT helpline 1890 200 255.  To avail of this option, the caller needs their property details, PPSN and details of the bank account or other source from which they wish the payment to be deducted.  </p><p>  The requirements of a property owner to self-assess and file an LPT return even if he or she does not receive a form from Revenue, and the telephone filing arrangements, have been set out in national and local newspaper advertisements last week.  I am satisfied that this range of filing and payment options provides property owners with the opportunity to meet their LPT obligations, and I do not propose to extend the closing date.</p></reply>

It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a third rate of income tax of either 42%, 43%, 46% or 51% to be applied on the portion of taxable incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum.  In addition, it is also assumed that the threshold for the proposed new income tax rates mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  On that basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, of the introduction of the new rates would be of the order of &euro;52 million, &euro;104 million, &euro;260 million and &euro;520 million respectively.</p><p>  However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.  These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2010, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. They are, therefore, provisional and subject to revision.  It should be noted that Gross Income is as defined in the Revenue Statistical Report 2011.  It should also be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p></reply>

The appointed service providers have extensive nationwide outlets and can process payment of LPT either in full as a single payment or by phased payments on a weekly or monthly basis as best suits individual needs.  The imposition of transaction charges is at he discretion of the individual service providers.  I am advised that An Post levies a charge of &euro;1 per transaction; Payzone levies a charge of 75 cent per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100; and Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.</p><p>  In regard to phased payments I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two other options available.  First, with effect from 1 July 2013 payment of LPT can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income, or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This option does not incur any fees or charges and facilitates payment of LPT in even amounts across the year in question.</p><p>  Second, phased payments can also be made by way of direct debit from the property owner&rsquo;s current account in a bank or other financial institution, including a credit union.  In these cases the direct debit deductions will commence on 15 July 2013 and will be deducted on the 15th day of each month thereafter.

Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders regulated by the Central Bank.  The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website www.centralbank.ie.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that as soon as a borrower goes into arrears, a lender must communicate promptly and clearly with the borrower to establish in the first instance why the repayment schedule as per the mortgage contract, has not been adhered to. A lender must pro-actively encourage its borrowers to engage with them about financial difficulties which may prevent them from meeting their mortgage repayments.  A lender must ensure that all communications about arrears and pre-arrears are provided to the borrower in a timely manner. All information relating to a lender&rsquo;s handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases must be presented to the borrower in a clear and consumer friendly manner. The language used in communications must indicate a willingness to work with the borrower to address the situation and must be in plain English so that it is easily understood. Legal jargon must be avoided, where possible. </p><p>  A lender must also prepare and make available to borrowers, an information booklet providing details of its MARP and this must include:</p><p>  a) an explanation of its MARP, including the alternative repayment measures available to borrowers and outline in general terms, the lender&rsquo;s criteria for assessing requests for alternative repayment measures;</p><p>  b) a statement that the borrower will not be required to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type;</p><p>  c) information about the potential availability of relevant State supports such as mortgage interest relief or Mortgage Interest Supplement;</p><p>  d) relevant contact points (i.e., the dedicated arrears contact points not the general customer service contact points); and</p><p>  e) reference to relevant website(s) operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS). </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 13 March the Central Bank announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks and proposed changes to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  The new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.  The Central Bank is also updating the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.  Issues being considered in the review include:</p><p>  - New safeguards to ensure borrowers are given sufficient warning before being classified as &lsquo;non cooperating&rsquo;; </p><p>  - Changes to the contact levels permitted, while ensuring consumers are not subject to harassment; </p><p>  - Transparency on resolution options so borrowers have a full understanding before making a decision; and</p><p>  - Consideration on whether there is merit in allowing a lender to move a borrower in arrears off a tracker rate where the lender has offered an alternative arrangement which is more advantageous in the long term.</p><p>  Further information on the review is available on www.centralbank.ie.  The Central Bank expects to publish the revised Code before the end of May.</p></reply>

I have sought to re-assure property owners by publicly stating on numerous occasions that where they make their property valuation in an honest and reasonable manner, whether they base that on Revenue's own valuation guidance or some other means, that valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter. </p><p>  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) monthly report, &#8220;<i>The Residential Property Price Index&#8221;</i> , provides guidance on establishing the percentage reduction to be applied to property values where the only reliable comparable home values available to them are 2010, 2011 or 2012.  The CSO's report is designed to measure the change in the level of prices paid for residential properties sold in Ireland and is compiled using data on mortgage drawdowns provided on a monthly basis from mortgage lending institutions.  The report is based on the prices of properties that were actually sold and tracks percentage changes in values over time related to an index point set at January 2005.  It does not, however, show average prices.  Nor does it include cash based transactions.  </p><p>  The Revenue valuation guidance also uses the above CSO data to adjust for price changes in the interim.  Consequently, using the Revenue valuation guidance will give property owners average indicative valuations based on the property type, age and location on an adjusted basis and can be relied on to assist property owners in determining the appropriate valuation band for their particular property.  In conjunction with the Revenue guidance, the property owner should consider the specifics of his or her own property, for example, if the property has certain unique features, is smaller or larger than the average property in the area, or is in a significantly poor state of repair and these factors should be taken into account in the owner's assessment of the valuation of the property.   </p><p>  The property price register details can also be used as a further source to help the owner determine the valuation band and this is the case even where the details from the prices register are potentially dated.  It is particularly so given that the majority of properties will fall into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band, which means that property owners are not required to provide a precise value for their property.  Therefore, if a person lives in a house similar to a house that was sold in 2010, applying the percentage reduction in property values for that area as set out in the CSO monthly Price Index report should give a reasonable basis for selecting a valuation band. </p><p>  I am satisfied that using the Revenue valuation guidance along with the person's own knowledge of their property and, considering these together with the property prices register, should allow the owner make an honest and reasonable assessment of the valuation band for their property.</p></reply>

Building on the 2011 &lsquo;Keane Report&rsquo;, the Central Bank, under its MARS project, has for some time been intensively working with lenders to ensure that they can offer a range of longer term forbearance options to their customers who are experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Deputy will be further aware that, on 13 March 2013, the Central Bank announced additional measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks. This new approach is aimed at ensuring that banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.</p><p>  Performance targets have been set for: ACC, AIB, Bank of Ireland, KBC Bank Ireland, Permanent TSB, and Ulster Bank.  The Central Bank will also, over the coming period, set targets for the conclusion of durable solutions and for the sustainability of such solutions.  Arrangements will be put in place to audit and monitor progress made against these targets.</p><p>  The overall objective of this process is to ensure banks offer, where it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances of an individual case, durable and sustainable solutions to their mortgage customers who are in arrears.  In that regard, in addition to the existing forbearance arrangements such as term extensions or reduced payments that were being deployed, the Keane Report outlined other long term forbearance/resolution options such as split mortgages, sale by agreement, and trade down mortgages that could be utilized.  The Report also recognised that lenders could develop other possible options in this area for use by their customers.  The particular option suggested in the newspaper article would, in broad terms represent a payment holiday and extension of term for the borrowers involved.</p><p>  It should be noted that in the latest Central Bank statistics on mortgage arrears published on 7 March, under the Central Bank&rsquo;s own assessment of permanent resolution options, some 13,396 such restructures of primary dwelling homes were classified as term extension.  The new Central Bank targets and associated auditing requirement will provide additional information on such restructures over the coming months.</p></reply>

The site allows for searches by both property type and country/area.  In each instance, information about the firm dealing with the insolvency and its contact details are provided. Potential purchasers are encouraged to contact the receivers to obtain additional information on specific properties and to submit expressions of their interest to purchase.</p><p>  In the case of property under the control of debtors, NAMA is precluded, under Section 202 of the NAMA Act 2009, from disclosing confidential information. Confidential information is specifically defined to include information relating to debtors. Furthermore, Section 99 of the Act provides that, on acquisition of a loan, NAMA takes over the obligations of the participating institution under the loan, one of which is the contractual duty of confidentiality which the debtor enjoyed while still a customer of the participating institution. Information about individual debtors or guarantors is also protected against disclosure by the Data Protection Acts with which NAMA must comply as a data controller.  However, in cases where NAMA receives enquiries from potential purchasers about specific properties under the control of debtors, it can facilitate contact with a view to enabling sales transactions to take place.  </p><p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, as part of the Government&rsquo;s decision on 7th February to appoint Special Liquidators (SL) to IBRC, it was decided that NAMA would acquire those loans which have not been sold after the SL have completed their current valuation and sales process.  The SL is currently in the valuation stage of this process.  NAMA has therefore not yet acquired any loans from the SL, nor has it any sight of those loans, and all such loans remain under the management of the SL until such time as the sales process has been completed.</p></reply>

The reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to the supply of gas and electricity in Ireland.  The majority of EU Member States apply a much higher VAT rate to the supply of gas and electricity as EU VAT law provides that the standard VAT rate should apply to these services.  However, as part of a derogation to EU VAT law, Ireland is entitled to retain a reduced rate to the supply of gas and electricity on the basis that we applied a reduced rate to the supply of domestic fuels on 1 January 1991.  However, under this derogation the VAT rate may not be reduced below 12%.</p><p>  While it is possible, therefore, to reduce the VAT rate on gas and electricity to 12%, this would have to apply to all activity currently applying at the 13% rate, as EU VAT law does not allow the application of three reduced VAT rates. Such a move would cost around &euro;270m.  I have no plans to reduce the 13.5% rate as this would be costly to the Exchequer.</p><p>  While it is not possible under EU VAT law to make reductions based on the age profile of the customer, I would point out that the Department of Social Protection provide a household benefits package, which comprises an electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence to elderly people living permanently in the State.  In terms of domestic fuels, such persons can decide to receive an electricity allowance credit of &euro;35 each month or a gas allowance credit of &euro;35 each month.  People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. The package is also available to carers. Customers under the age of 70 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and live alone or only with certain categories of people may also have an entitlement to the package.

All taxpayers are afforded the opportunity to pay their outstanding tax liabilities before any such liabilities are referred for collection enforcement action.  In the event that it is necessary to refer outstanding tax debts to the Sheriff for collection, I am informed that the Sheriffs make every effort to collect outstanding tax liabilities without utilising their powers of seizure.  However, in circumstances where seizure of goods is necessary due to non-engagement by the taxpayer, the Sheriffs are legally authorised to use their powers to enforce collection of outstanding tax debts.</p><p>  As I advised in my response to the Deputy's previous Parliamentary Question on this issue (No. 216 on 16 April 2013), Sheriffs are Officers of the Court, who hold office under section 12 of the Court Officers Act 1945.  A Sheriff's debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926 as amended, which allows that where necessary in execution of a warrant the Sheriff may enter any dwelling house or other building, regardless of whether the building is occupied or not, for the purpose of seizing goods, that are not exempt under the Act. </p><p>  Section 12 of Enforcement of Court Order Acts 1926 provides as follows:</p><p>  &#8220;(1) No action shall lie against an under-sheriff who has complied with the conditions hereinafter stated for or on account of his having entered or broken into any lands, house, close, or other premises for the purpose of taking in execution any goods, animals, or other chattels which were or might be on or in such lands, house, close, or premises, or for or on account of any injury occasioned to such lands, house, or premises by or in the course of such entry or breaking in.</p><p>  (2) The conditions hereinbefore mentioned are:-</p><p>  (<i>a</i> ) that before breaking into any dwelling-house or other building the under-sheriff shall make reasonable efforts to enter peaceably and without violence, and</p><p>  (<i>b</i> ) where the under-sheriff breaks and enters the premises of a person other than the person against whom he has been called upon to enforce an execution order, he shall either have had reasonable grounds for believing that there were some goods, animals, or chattels of such last-mentioned person in such premises or he shall actually find some such goods, animals, or chattels in such premises&quot;.</p></reply>

Applicants are asked to highlight on a questionnaire, if they have any pre-planned arrangements that may interfere with their attendance at the programme.  In order to make a full commitment to the programme this can result in applicants asking to have a place reserved on the next occurrence of the programme.

There are currently over 4,700 such posts allocated to schools at primary level  and 777 posts at post primary level. This includes the standard  learning/language support allocation that is given to all schools and the  additional support that is provided to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language support. Further additional temporary language  support posts are provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeal  Boards.</p><p>  The need to reform the allocation of the General Allocation Model at primary  level arose because the existing system operated primarily on the basis of 2003  enrolments which are long out of date and had been criticised by the Ombudsman for Children. Schools now have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between  language support and learning support depending on their specific needs. The  new single allocation for the General Allocation Model (GAM) and language support is based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year. This simplified approach to (GAM) will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school.</p><p>  The allocation process for the 2013/14 school year is currently underway in my  Department and the staffing arrangements, including the appeals process, have been published on the Department website.  The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</p></reply>

At Primary level a teacher exchange scheme exists whereby a teacher may voluntarily exchange with a teacher in any other school.  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years.</p><p>  Within the redeployment arrangements at primary level there is provision for the most junior surplus permanent/CID holding teacher due to be placed on the panel to seek to be replaced on the redeployment panel by an alternative permanent/CID holding teacher in the school interested in going on the redeployment panel. If more than one permanent/CID holding teacher applies to be placed on the redeployment panel in place of the most junior permanent/CID holding teacher, the Board of Management will consider all applications from permanent/CID holding teachers. Where a Board of Management decides that the most junior permanent/CID holding teacher can be replaced on the panel, it will determine which applicant senior permanent/CID holding teacher is to replace the most junior permanent/CID holding teacher. The final decision to admit a teacher to a panel rests with the Patron.</p><p>  Redeployment arrangements for surplus post-primary teachers were introduced as part of the implementation of particular aspects of the Croke Park Agreement. The parties identified that voluntary movement, if provided for, could assist the operation of the main redeployment arrangements. A pilot voluntary redeployment scheme is currently in operation to assist in the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers in the Sligo area. This scheme is confined to schools in close proximity to the surplus schools in Sligo. This pilot scheme will operate only for redeployment in 2013.</p><p>  The above schemes are agreed under the auspices of the Teachers' Conciliation Council, a body established in accordance with the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives from Teachers, School Management, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission.  Any proposals by any of the Education partners to expand  the above schemes should, in the first instance, be raised at this Council.  </p></reply>

A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he/she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved course or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from the previous 1 October. Otherwise he/she would continue to be assessed on the basis of his/her parents' income.</p><p>  In recognition of the fact that a student under 23 yeas of age can be estranged from his/her parents, it is possible under the student grant scheme, as an exceptional measure, for such a candidate to be assessed without reference to his/her parents/guardians income or address.  However, compelling independent evidence of estrangement must be provided to the grant awarding authority to enable this. The type of independent evidence includes a letter from a social worker or other appropriate officer of the Health Service Executive explaining the circumstances of the estrangement.  Confirmation that a candidate is living separately from his/her parents/guardians is not sufficient.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to supporting access of minority denomination communities to schools that are of their tradition or ethos. The provision made by Kilkenny College caters for the needs of children from the Protestant community spread across several counties.  Accordingly, I was happy to have officials of my Department work with the college authorities to work through a basis on which such a transfer would be feasible if that was their ultimate judgement.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that over the course of those detailed discussions the College authorities shared information in confidence with the Department and while I wish to respect that position at the same I do want to provide the Deputy with information on the arrangements made to assist and support the College through its transition.</p><p>  Kilkenny College will cease to charge fees with effect from the start of school year in September next and as a result my Department will in future pay the salaries of a teacher for every 19 students attending the College. This compares with one teacher for every 21 students in fee charging schools at present and which will rise to one teacher for every 23 students in September 2013.  My Department will also provide capitation and related funding to the College on the same basis as every other voluntary secondary school within the Free Education Scheme.</p><p>  I approved specific transition arrangements in relation to the teaching staff employed by the College and also reviewed the level of exchequer funding approved by the Department for school building projects carried out by the College.  The precise cost of additional exchequer expenditure in Kilkenny College will be a function later this year of the actual enrolment in the College as a school within the Free Scheme.</p><p>  While the arrangements made in relation to Kilkenny College were specific to its circumstances and plans to enter the Free Scheme, I have made clear that my Department will engage constructively with any fee charging school that is considering how best to secure its future. On the basis of the analysis I published earlier this year on the income from fees available to fee charging schools I expect that a minority of the fee charging schools will wish to engage with my Department, as Kilkenny College did, in order to plan for the future.</p></reply>

At primary level the focus is on acquisition of the two national languages, Irish and English.  Beyond the primary level, the focus expands to include not only English and Irish but also other languages.  Post-primary builds on the foundation established at primary level by offering not only English and Irish but also a range of foreign languages. French, German, Spanish, Italian at Junior Cycle with the addition of Russian, Japanese and Arabic at Leaving Cycle.  Examinations are also offered in a number of other non-curricular EU languages for native language speakers from EU Member States.  Candidates presented in some 16 EU languages for the Leaving Certificate in 2012.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2012) will support schools in fostering practical language-learning skills.  It will give all students the opportunity to study at least one language in addition to Irish and English.  Revised syllabuses of modern foreign languages are scheduled for implementation in 2016.  Schools will also have the flexibility to offer short courses of 100 hours duration i.e. in a second language, including languages not currently offered in the junior cycle curriculum. The NCCA is currently developing a short course in Chinese, which will also be available to schools from 2014.</p><p>  A Transition Year module in Chinese was launched last year, having already been piloted by over 20 schools across Ireland.  For many years now, Japanese has been offered in a number of TY programmes, and has resulted in a follow-on uptake of Japanese to Leaving Certificate level, which in 2012 reached 239 students.  In 2012, over 30,000 students sat a European language for the Leaving Certificate, including around 26,000 in French, 6,700 in German, 4,000 in Spanish and 700 in Polish, with smaller numbers taking other languages such as Italian, Japanese and Russian and Arabic.  The Post-Primary Languages Initiative is broadening its remit to provide support for all teachers of modern foreign languages, through the provision of materials on its website. It was originally set up to offer support to schools who wished to introduce Spanish, Italian and Japanese and Russian.</p><p>  Prospective students have access to a wide range of foreign language courses at third level that can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines across business, the arts, the humanities and the sciences.  A number of language programmes have also been selected for funding through the Springboard skills initiative which was launched in May 2011.  Preliminary data from the HEA research on the provision of foreign languages indicates that some 9,000 third level students are studying a foreign language.</p><p>  The EU's Erasmus initiative has played a key role in enhancing the language proficiency of Irish graduates. 28,000 Irish students have benefited from this programme over the past 25 years. Irish participation in Erasmus has risen significantly in recent years, including an 18% increase last year &ndash; the fourth highest growth in Europe.

Springboard 2011 provided part-time higher education places for 4,956 unemployed people on 204 courses at certificate, degree and post graduate level. To date 2,460 participants have graduated from Springboard 2011 courses and 649 are continuing to a further year of study.  5,335 unemployed people have enrolled on 211 different higher education courses under the second phase of Springboard in 2012.  Graduation data from Springboard 2012 will be available in the summer.</p><p>  The evaluation framework for Springboard provides for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of outputs. A first stage evaluation report, which was published by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in February 2012 and is available at www.hea.ie/en/node/1463, showed that Springboard has been very successful in reaching its target cohorts: 77% of participants were aged between 25 and 49, 60% had been out of work for more than 1 year and 20% had previously been employed in construction.  A second stage evaluation report was published in February 2013 and is available at www.hea.ie/en/node/1514. It shows that 30% of Springboard participants were back in work within 6 weeks of completing a Springboard course and that 40% were back in work within 6 months of completion.  Outcomes varied across programme areas and levels and by age and duration unemployed.</p></reply>

The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being.  The content of the Guidelines draw together existing elements and structures that are in place in post-primary schools - the SPHE curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan and the NEPS Continuum of Support Framework.  They provide clear evidence-based advice for schools on the effective and coherent integration of structures and systems to assist schools with the task of whole-school implementation.</p><p>  The Guidelines emphasise the need to integrate all elements by using a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health.  This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships.  Support for schools will be integrated into existing CPD work plans for the SPHE support service and will be coordinated nationally in collaboration with NEPS and HSE to ensure a streamlined approach.  Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.</p></reply>

These contracts were signed last summer and the migration of schools onto the new services is currently underway.</p><p>  The Department is aware of the difficulty that some schools, such as St Flannan's National School School have with their broadband service.  Through the public procurement process the Department has sought as far as possible to reduce the reliance on satellite services and in this regard the number of schools reliant on a satellite connection has fallen from approximately 1,800 in 2005 to approximately 160 at present.  Satellite connections and DLS connections of up to 1megabyte have only been awarded where no other solution was proposed and contracts for these connections have only been awarded for one year.  These schools will be re-tendered this summer and in the interim the Department will liaise with service providers to try and ensure that where possible improved connections will be made available.</p></reply>

The REV gives a fuller, more detailed breakdown of spending by each Department and Vote than the spending information announced in the Estimates which are published with the Budget each year.  The REV also gives the provisional outturn for spending in the preceding year and includes performance budgeting information for each area of Government spending. </p><p>  The REV 2013, published last week on Wednesday, 17 April, elaborates on the 2013 spending information published in the Expenditure Report 2013 at Budget time last December.  Individual Vote Estimates were also presented to the D&aacute;il and referred to the relevant D&aacute;il Select Committees for discussion.  The Revised Estimates set out detailed financial and output information for all Departments and it is important that select committees have the opportunity to examine this information and in particular the performance budgeting information and programme outputs.</p><p>  In keeping with the largely technical nature of the REV, the majority of adjustments arise from the allocation of savings around pay, pensions, conditions of service and reductions in public service numbers.  The estimates in Budget 2013 included some of these savings in individual Votes and also an undistributed amount that was yet to be allocated.  These savings have now been fully apportioned across individual Votes on the basis of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations.  A small element of the 2013 savings is non-Exchequer, non-voted or non-pay, so these savings will not be seen in the voted Exchequer pay total shown in the REV 2013. </p><p>  The overall savings arising as a result of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations would have achieved the required savings for 2013 and the full target by the end of the deal period.  I made a decision to publish the Estimates, which are based on the implementation of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations, because that is what we hoped the position would be.  The recommendations were the most appropriate means of achieving the savings required.  The Government will continue to reflect on last week's outcome of the ballot.  In the meantime, we have agreed to request the CEO of the Labour Relations Committee to make contact with the parties in the coming days to establish whether or not there is a basis for a negotiated agreement to meet the budgetary targets.  He will report back in time to allow for further discussion and decision by Government on the next steps.  Following that, any changes required will be reflected in the Estimates as appropriate and presented to the Oireachtas as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

Transfers between grades in the civil service can be arranged on an informal, head-to-head, basis.

The Employment Appeals Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably, this has increased the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard. All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal. </p><p>  The tribunal itself has been active in ensuring that the resources allocated to it are used in an efficient manner and there is an ongoing review of how this is best delivered.  For example, divisions of the tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency.  Cases are assessed at the scheduling stage and those that are seen as requiring less time to conclude or are of a similar nature are streamed together in an effort to conclude as many cases as possible in as short a time as possible.  This is reflected directly in the increase in the number of cases finalised by the tribunal over the last three years.  These increases are as follows: 2010 + 30%, 2011 + 11% and 2012 + 13%.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the tribunal, I believe that the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five workplace relations bodies.  The reform programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier workplace relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.  Work has commenced on the drafting of a workplace relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.</p><p>  The purpose of the reform programme is to provide a more efficient and effective system of resolving employment disputes.  Substantial progress has already been made in this regard.  For example, the establishment of a workplace relations single contact portal from January this year has resulted in all complaints now being acknowledged and respondents notified within a matter of weeks of receipt of the complaint.  In some cases this was taking up to eight months.  This service enhancement increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings.  I understand that the backlog for Rights Commissioner hearings has effectively been eliminated.</p><p>  The service improvements have also been underpinned by the launch from January last year of a single complaint form for all first instance workplace relations complaints.  A Pilot Early Resolution Service commenced on 14 May last year.  This service will provide the opportunity in certain cases for employers and employees to resolve issues without recourse to formal adjudication hearings, thus relieving pressure on adjudication services such as the Rights Commissioner Service and the EAT. </p><p>  The two tier model now being designed will deliver a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision-makers with a target period of three months from the time of complaint to hearing, and written, reasoned decisions within 28 working days of the hearing with published decisions.  Finally, I also intend to provide for a more effective method of enforcing the awards of adjudicators.</p></reply>

An employer who employs a 3rd country national requiring, but without, an employment permit is open to prosecution under the Employment Permits legislation.  There is a careful balance to be struck. On the one hand there can be situations where an employee, unwittingly, falls out of the employment permit regime and the question then arises as to whether there should be a channel for them to regularise their position. On the other hand, such a provision should not serve to incentivise employers for not adhering to their legal responsibilities.</p><p>  I do recognise that occasionally 3rd country nationals, having entered the labour market legally, can find themselves, through no fault of their own, without the necessary permission to remain employed, or, having left the original employment in respect of which an employment permit was granted, are unable to re-enter employment. From time to time the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland brings such cases to the attention of my Department and in such circumstances, I may consider the granting of an employment permit on an exceptional and case by case basis. Applicants must set out in detail their particular circumstances explaining how they arrived at their situation and satisfy me that a refusal to grant an employment permit would cause undue hardship.</p></reply>

During 2012 employment increased by 7% within the ICT sector, by 12% within the Agri-Food sector and by 6% in professional, scientific and technical activities.  There is strong demand within the ICT sector here due to -</p><p>  - an expansion of the business operations of companies, inflow of foreign R&amp;amp;D investment and formation of new start-ups;</p><p>  - potential for foreign companies to win mobile investment from parent companies and the availability of high skilled personnel to enhance their business proposition; </p><p>  - emerging skills demands around cloud computing, service design, database management, social networks and media, development of e-commerce applications and internet marketing.</p><p>  The Government has brought education and training to the heart of its Action Plan for Jobs and targets set for initiatives such as Springboard, the ICT Conversion Programme have the ultimate aim of providing Ireland with the highest proportion of ICT graduates as a share of third level graduates by 2018.  New Sectors which are small in employment terms but which have experienced additional employment growth include clean/green technologies, creative digital media and content industries, marine and maritime and healthcare (eHealth) services.  Traditional Sectors where employment has shown recovery include tourism and hospitality, and also within the sub-sector of the construction industry which has focussed on business opportunities in the design and use of eco-construction products and materials and energy efficiency improvements in housing and buildings. </p><p>  As regards foreign direct investment, there have been substantial job gains in the high-tech sector within both new arrival foreign investment companies (such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) as well as from well-established businesses such as Paypall, HP and IBM. Indigenous engineering, software, internationally traded services and medical devices companies have also performed well in export markets.  The main skills sets in demand within these sectors are &ndash;</p><p>  - international management skills (e.g. export marketing, international marketing and sales, managing international customers and suppliers, etc.) </p><p>  - foreign language capabilities and cultural awareness (e.g. mainline European including German, French, Italian and Spanish, as well as &ndash; at a relatively lower level - Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Arabic) </p><p>  - international sales skills</p><p>  - marketing &amp;amp; sales skills</p><p>  - science &amp;amp; engineering skills (including within the renewable energies sub-sector)</p><p>  - high-level ICT skills</p><p>  There are currently 1,848,900 people at work in the economy. As well as additional jobs that have arisen in recent years, it is important to note that there is a level of replacement demand in the workforce as people retire, take up home/caring duties, take up full time education, etc. This creates replacement demand estimated at 44,000 jobs per annum.</p><p>  Skills demands arise not only from within the additional jobs created but also within existing jobs as, in order to remain competitive, firms need to continually up-skill their workforces.  The main drivers of change impacting on the skillset requirements for these jobs include customer demand, new technology developments, product and market specific regulations and directives, and internal organisational change. </p><p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure our workforce is well aligned with the skills that employers need now and into the future. As a country, we must continue to up-skill, not just for additional jobs but also in terms of existing jobs. This is vital in order to compete internationally as other countries are doing so.</p></reply>

Details of total employment and the number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in each year from 2008 to 2012 are set out in the tabular statement.</p><p>2012 saw a strong performance in the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) won by Ireland with 12,722 new jobs being created in IDA client companies. This also represents a significant achievement in terms of reaching the target of 12,500 new jobs set in the Government&rsquo;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs. IDA Ireland has indicated that the gains made spanned a range of sectors, with particularly strong performances from social/digital media, IT, financial services and life sciences.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s concentration on attracting employment intensive services to Ireland is leading to the speedy creation of jobs.  A significant proportion of investments in 2012 was in the area of services operations, particularly serving the Europe, Middle East and Asia Market.  A notable feature of 2012 was the wide range of green field investments coming to Ireland. In total, there were 145 individual investments, of which 66 (over 40%) were from companies coming to Ireland for the first time.</p><p>In recent years IDA Ireland has established a presence in high growth markets, such as China and India, and remains committed to the goal of securing 20% of all greenfield investments from high growth markets by 2014.  The Agency has also broadened and deepened its portfolio, by including not just large multinational corporations (MNCs) but also working closely with &ldquo;fast growth&rdquo; companies, who aspire to be the MNCs of the future.  This strategy was successfully implemented in 2012 with a range of fast growing companies announcing that they had decided to invest in Ireland.</p><p>While the global outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, IDA has assured me that it will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 12,000 jobs this year as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p><p><b> Table showing Total Employment and New Jobs Created in IDA Ireland</b></p><p><b> Client Companies from 2008 to 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Employment Data</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2008</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2009</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2010</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2011</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Total Employment </td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>152,514</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>138,171</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>139,760</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>145,878</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>152,785</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">New Jobs Created</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>6,719</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>3,568</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>11,224</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>13.068</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>12,722</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It was clear what was needed was to transform our economy from one that became over dependent on property, construction and debt, to one focused on enterprise, innovation and exports.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a key instrument in this objective and is designed to deliver measures right across Government to protect existing jobs and support the creation of new ones.  A key feature of the Action Plan process is that each of the actions to be delivered is broken down into Quarterly milestones and progress against these targets is rigorously monitored and published on a quarterly basis.</p><p>  One year into the Action Plan for Jobs<i></i>process, we can see evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. Over 90% of the 270 individual actions committed to last year were completed on time.  They included many important reforms designed to enhance competitiveness, improve access to finance, support enterprise and develop employment in sectors of opportunity for Ireland.  In many cases, the full impact of these reforms will take time to materialise.  However, some significant objectives have already been realised, including:</p><p>  - the establishment of a Microfinance Fund for small businesses;</p><p>  - the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme; </p><p>  - new supports for first time exporters; </p><p>  - the launch of a new Women-In-Business programme; </p><p>  - the simplification and extension of the Employer's PRSI Exemption scheme; </p><p>  - the launch of a National Broadband Plan;</p><p>  - the piloting of a Health Innovation Hub; and </p><p>  - work being undertaken to develop sectors such as Cloud Computing, Digital Games, Manufacturing, the Green Economy and other areas.</p><p>  More significantly, last year, 12,000 jobs were created in the private sector, particularly in export-oriented sectors that are targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.  Exports from Irish-based companies also reached record levels last year.</p><p>  The Government will continue to build on this progress in 2013.  This year's Action Plan for Jobs includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies or Offices.  The Plan also includes seven landmark projects, or Disruptive Reforms, that the Government has identified as having potential to impact significantly on job creation.  As a small open economy, we are influenced heavily by developments in international markets.  However, the merit of the Action Plan for Jobs is that every year, each Department is required to focus on changes that can be brought about to make a practical contribution to the target of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2016.</p></reply>

Innovation and technology are elements of a series of inputs which are requisite for a job to be sustained in commercial enterprise &ndash; i.e. companies need to identify markets to sell their goods and services, they need to have finance in order to invest in capital and human resources, they need to put in place the delivery and production capacity which meets their customers&rsquo; needs, and they need to focus on the development of new and improved products, processes and services which can ably compete in international markets.  </p><p>  While some jobs are created in research organisations arising from direct participation in EU Framework Programme projects, the main benefit arising from participation is that it offers valuable opportunities to companies of all sizes based in Ireland to participate in high-quality research collaborations with their European counterparts, with the support of EU funding. Collaborative Research forms the core of the FP7 programme, fostering collaborative research across Europe through transnational consortia of industry and academia. </p><p>  FP7 participation enables companies to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks, access to specialist equipment, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.  The experience and the knowledge gained by Irish companies from transnational collaboration often translates into company expansion, creating new jobs, at a later stage. However, as previously stated, innovation and technology are only some of the elements required for sustainable job creation. </p><p>  Through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s facilitation and financial support Irish companies and academic researchers secured in the region of &euro;85 million in 2011, and approximately &euro;95 million in 2012.  Since FP7 commenced in 2007, Ireland&rsquo;s researchers, research organisations and companies have been involved in more than 1,500 successful applications obtaining European Commission funding of approximately &euro;485 million.  The overall Irish success rate, at 22.7%, is above the European Member State average of 22.1%, and a very positive indication of the prospects for Irish participation over the lifetime of FP7, and is in line with our national targets.  </p></reply>

In the majority of cases involving relocation, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s experience is that the shift is to lower cost emerging economies, with a smaller number of companies relocating to other developed country locations, largely in Eastern Europe.  Some of the job losses are due to cyclical factors, however, and will recover. Consequently, in addition to winning new foreign direct investment (FDI), IDA Ireland&rsquo;s objective is to retain existing clients, improve the quality of employment opportunities in Ireland and secure greater economic impact from such investments.</p><p>  I am delighted to say that 2012 was a particularly good year for job creation in Agency supported companies, with IDA client companies creating a total of 12,722 gross new full time jobs (6,750 net new jobs).  The IDA client base in Ireland now employs 152,785 people, a level last recorded before the global financial crisis began in 2008.  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in 2013, investment in key global markets are slowing down, particularly in Europe.  There are, however, opportunities for growth in the IT/technology sector, in specific areas of financial services, in life sciences, and in social/digital media. To date, in 2013, IDA Ireland job announcements include: Vistakon - 300 jobs; Ebay - 450 jobs; Facebook - 150 jobs; Yahoo - 200 jobs; FireEye - 100 jobs; Nypro - 200 jobs.</p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to attract such projects to Ireland, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.  This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.</p></reply>

Ireland is already rated highly internationally as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business, and we have built a strong competitive basis on which to go out and compete on global markets.  For example, Ireland has moved up to 20th place in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 and is also ranked 15th in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2012 Report.</p><p>  There are a number of key areas where Ireland tops global competitiveness rankings, including: </p><p>  - business impact of rules on foreign direct investment; </p><p>  - inflation;</p><p>  - FDI and technology transfer; </p><p>  - availability of skilled labour; </p><p>  - flexibility and adaptability of the labour force; and </p><p>  - investment incentives.</p><p>  We are making progress on the jobs front through the Action Plan for Jobs process, which is systematically transforming the operating environment for business, improving our competitiveness and supporting companies increasing employment.   </p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland companies created almost 10,000 net new jobs between them, representing the strongest performance for the IDA in a decade and the best performance in over five years for Enterprise Ireland.  There was a good regional spread in these new jobs, including new investments in Letterkenny, Sligo, Westport, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Limerick, Kildare and Wexford.  The latest QNHS figures show that overall, employment in the economy increased by 1,200 people year-on-year to the end of 2012.  This was the first increase in employment since the second quarter of 2008 and is in stark contrast to a situation where the economy was losing an average of almost 90,000 jobs per year in the period 2008 to 2011.  Meanwhile, we are also showing that we can compete on international trade markets, as our total exports in 2012, at over &euro;182 billion, were at their highest level ever.</p><p>  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that we are moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy. The Forf&aacute;s report advises that over half of recent cost competitiveness gains are attributable to favourable exchange rate movements. The report also indicates that upward price pressure is beginning to emerge in some areas, while rigidities continue to persist within the economy.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a range of concrete measures to address issues highlighted in the report in relation to labour costs, property costs, business services and broader consumer costs.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s broader agenda to enhance productivity, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in the world to do business.</p></reply>

That policy has proved to be particularly successful as, at the end of 2012, there were 152,785 people employed in over 1,000 IDA client companies which, in turn, result in another 100,000 spin off jobs in the Irish economy. The net effect is that 1 in 7 Jobs in the Irish economy is accounted for by FDI. FDI is a key stimulator and driver of the Irish economy through its contribution to Exchequer finances, exports and research and development.</p><p>  Interaction with companies who have decided to invest in Ireland continuously highlights that there are many factors which attract such companies to this country. We have stable government, an attractive corporation tax rate, a young educated workforce, a technologically advanced environment and a strong track record in winning FDI.  In addition, Ireland is a member of the EU and the Euro zone.  Another factor which weighs heavily in our favour is the pro-business environment which permeates our economy. </p><p>  It is for these reasons that the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 ranks Ireland very favourably in a number of key areas of importance for FDI. The survey ranks Ireland:</p><p>  - First for availability of skilled labour</p><p>  - First for flexibility and adaptability of workforce</p><p>  -  First for investment incentives</p><p>  -  First for attitudes towards globalisation</p><p>  - Second for business legislation- openness to foreign investors</p><p>  - Second for large corporations that are efficient by international standards</p><p>  - Second for adaptability of companies</p><p>  - Fourth for Corporate Tax rate on profit and real corporate taxes</p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI projects, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.  This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. </p></reply>

I am aware that many retail and commercial companies are concerned about the impact which upward only rent reviews are having on their cost base. When the Government came into office, it gave extensive consideration to abolishing upward-only rent reviews in leases signed before 28 February 2010. The advice received by the Government was that it was not possible to develop a scheme to tackle this issue that would not be vulnerable to a Constitutional challenge or compensation claims from landlords. On the basis of this advice, the Government concluded that it was not feasible to legislate to abolish upward only rent reviews.</p><p>  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan for Jobs, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group will comprise key Government Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.  The Group will hold its first meeting in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The aim of the National Internship Scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  The scheme provides work experience placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors.  Interns receive an allowance of &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement. This is payable for the period of the internship. While the scheme has been availed of by client companies of the enterprise development agencies, it does not directly result in an increase in the employment associated with those companies (i.e. participants are interns receiving social welfare payments, and not full-time employees receiving a salary from the placement).</p><p>The Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey does not capture data in relation to the number of Job Bridge participants in client companies of the development agencies. Table 1 sets out the Enterprise Ireland cost per job over the period 2002-2011. The Cost per Job Sustained measure is calculated by Forf&aacute;s and takes into account all direct agency expenditure on all client companies in a seven year period. Only jobs created during, and sustained at the end of each seven year period are represented in the calculations. The number of JobBridge participants is not associated with these calculations, and therefore the scheme will not have any direct impact on the cost per job in the development agencies.  The 2012 figure will be calculated and reported as part of the Enterprise Ireland Annual Report and Accounts for 2012, due to be published in mid-2013.</p><p>Since 2007 the cost per job sustained has increased.  The reasons for this are largely threefold:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">1. Enterprise Ireland provided additional supports to ensure Irish-owned companies were in a position to withstand the worst recession in decades e.g. the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">2. Additional supports relating to Dairy, Beef and Sheep, and Food Competitiveness Funds were administered by EI on behalf of third party agencies and form part of the calculation.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">3. A lower number of jobs sustained compared to earlier seven year periods in the context of the severe economic recession and resulting job losses.</div></p><p><b>Table 1- EI Cost per Job Sustained 2002-2011</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Time Period</b></th><th><b>Cost per Job sustained (2011 prices)</b></th></tr><tr><td>1996-2002</td><td>&euro;11,761</td></tr><tr><td>1997-2003</td><td>&euro;10,342</td></tr><tr><td>1998-2004</td><td>&euro;8,984</td></tr><tr><td>1999-2005</td><td>&euro;5,962</td></tr><tr><td>2000-2006</td><td>&euro;4,385</td></tr><tr><td>2001-2007</td><td>&euro;6,556</td></tr><tr><td>2002-2008</td><td>&euro;7,988</td></tr><tr><td>2003-2009</td><td>&euro;12,124</td></tr><tr><td>2004-2010</td><td>&euro;12,560</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2011</td><td>&euro;12,024</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-23a.681.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300068#WRO00200"><p>At a sectoral level, the largest job losses over the 2008-2012 period were in the construction sector, where employment fell by over 160,000, in manufacturing (down by almost 50,000) and retail and wholesale distribution (down by over 40,000). Smaller falls were recorded across a range of other service industries. By contrast, at the end of 2012, employment in two sub-sectors - healthcare and the information/communications sector - were above the levels of 2007/2008.</p><p>  Driven primarily by these sectoral trends, the occupations most affected by the down turn were the skilled trades, where employment fell by about 140,000.  The sharp contraction in construction and manufacturing also partly explains the fall of 60,000 in the unskilled or &#8220;elementary&#8221; manual occupations, which contain a sizeable number of unskilled construction workers.  Smaller but nonetheless significant declines have occurred for clerical and secretarial jobs (down by 50,000) and for sales and transport occupations affected by the fall in distribution (down by 50,000).  By contrast, professional workers, associate &amp;amp; technical professionals and managers actually experienced slight increases over the course of the recession. The number of science/engineering professionals and technicians, for example, rose by 16,000 between 2008 and 2012.  </p><p>  When broken down by highest education level achieved, employment for those with at best a Leaving Certificate or Post Leaving Certificate qualification fell by almost 370,000 between 2007 and 2012 whereas employment for persons with a third-level qualification rose by over 100,000. These changes reflect the rapid growth in the numbers of people with higher qualifications in the overall population as well as changes in employment prospects for those with various qualifications. The employment <i>rate</i>  (percentage of the adult population with jobs) fell for all groups between 2007 and 2012; however, the rate for those with third-level fell by about 6 percentage points, from 85% to 79%, while that for those with Leaving Certificate or PLC qualifications fell by 15 percentage points, from 75% to 60%, and those with lower qualifications saw even greater reductions, of the order of 18 percentage points.</p><p>  As a result of the downturn, the unemployment rate has risen significantly for persons with lower levels of education. For persons with at most primary education, the unemployment rate increased from10.3% to 27.8% between 2008 and 2012. For persons with a best a lower secondary education unemployment rate increased from 10.6% to 25.5% and for persons with a best a Leaving Certificate the unemployment rate increased from 6.7% to 16.9%. By contrast, the unemployment rate for those with honours degrees was relatively lower, at 6.5%, in 2012.</p><p>  In recognition of the skills gap among the unemployed people, the Government operates a number of initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. These include the Back to Education Allowance (26,000 people), Springboard (6,000 people) and Momentum (6,500 places).  Eligible participants on both Springboard and Momentum programmes retain their welfare payments made through my Department.</p><p>  These special initiatives are in addition to the existing range of full-time vocational training options provided through F&Aacute;S that are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. Specific Skills Training courses are employment-led and lead to qualifications that offer learners both generic and advanced skills. The expected outcomes are progression to employment in the occupational field or to further and higher education/training and the achievement of certification from levels 5 - 7 in the National Qualifications Framework.  F&Aacute;S also provides Traineeships which entail significant skill requirements best acquired through a combination of alternating periods of on and off-the-job training, as well as foundation courses for those who require them prior to going on to skills training.  There were some 21,000 participants on these three FAS programmes in 2012. F&Aacute;S has also expanded provision of free part-time and evening courses for unemployed people in recent years, and a further 21,000 people took such courses in 2012.   The Government is prioritising places on training courses for those who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All relevant stakeholders will have an opportunity to input to the review.</p></reply>

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p><p>  The basic rules governing the maximum duration a person can remain on Community Employment (CE) are unchanged since 2006. The maximum participation limits for CE are 3 years in total for those under 55 years of age, and 6 years in total for those of 55 to 65 years of age. Off-shore islander clients are exempt from CE participation caps. Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-related social welfare payment are eligible for one additional year on top of these two limits, i.e., 4 years for those under 55 and 7 years for those of 55 to 65. </p><p>  The actual length of time a person can remain on CE is dictated by a number of factors (as governed by the eligibility rules of CE):</p><p> - Age of the person</p><p> - Department of Social Protection (DSP ) payment and duration of receipt</p><p> - Previous participation on CE since 3<sup>rd</sup>   April 2000</p><p> - Whether they are considered job-ready at their CE contract end-date</p><p> - Engagement under a person's Individual Learner Plan (training &amp;amp; development)</p><p> - Budgetary limitations</p><p>  The overall duration limits are strictly enforced to maximize the number of places available for potential clients. </p><p>  There are two strands available on Community Employment (CE), namely Part-Time Integration Option (PTI), which is the one-year version of CE, and the Part-Time Job Option (PTJ), which is the three-year version of CE (subject to annually renewable contracts). All CE participant contracts are for 1 year's duration at a time. The ratio of PTI to PTJ places is set at 75% PTI to 25% PTJ to maintain the throughput of participants. A maximum of 10% of participants on the PTI Option can be extended into a subsequent year's participation. The annual renewal of PTJ participant contracts is subject to the factors mentioned above.</p><p>  Eligibility for the PTI Option is generally determined by being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum of 12 months. For the PTJ Option, the qualifying period is 3 years in receipt. There are some exceptions to these qualifying periods for certain categories of participants.  The only recent change to the CE operating Guidelines with respect to duration on the programme is that &#8220;time spent on CE no longer counts towards continued time on CE for new entrants who commence on or after 8 October 2012. Existing PTI participants can still have time spent on CE count as part of the qualifying period until they exit&#8221;.</p><p>  Previous to this amended rule being introduced, time spent on CE counted towards the CE-qualifying period, so it was possible for a client commencing CE under the PTI Option who had only been in receipt for 12 months to avail of one year's placement. If they happened to be in the 10% of PTIs extended into a second year, that would mean that the combination of their 12 months in receipt and two years on CE qualified them under the PTJ Option (i.e. 3 years on CE), thereby giving them a third consecutive year on CE.  The emphasis on shorter-term interventions on CE as part of the Pathways to Work Initiative is to assist the maximum number of eligible persons via participation on the scheme. The current rules governing CE eligibility allow for 10% persons engaged on a year's placement to have their time extended into a second year if they can demonstrate that they would benefit from such an extension.</p><p>  The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  on progression into employment.  There is a wide range of client groups which need access to CE - lone parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons.  DSP at all times is obliged to accommodate the needs of all these groups in terms of participation on Community Employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.</p></reply>

This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe, suggesting that JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention.</p></reply>

In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.</p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe. A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well. The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system. A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  I have no further plans for the respite care grant this year.</p></reply>

However, special arrangements do apply where a parent is working here and the children are resident in another EU Member State.  In 2012 the total cost of paying child benefit in respect of children resident in other EU countries was approximately &euro;13 million, down some 36% on 2008 when costs peaked.  This represents 0.65% of the total cost of child benefit expenditure.</p><p>  The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU regulations which co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  For the purposes of the EU regulations, Irish child benefit is classified as a family benefit and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits. EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families reside in another EU Member State may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under the EU regulations. As a Member State of the European Union, Ireland is bound to apply these regulations in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty regarding free movement of persons.</p><p>  Before payment is made in respect of children resident in other EU countries it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will impact on any entitlement under the Irish system. Once payment has commenced, as part of the Department&rsquo;s on-going control programme, these customers are required to confirm periodically their continued entitlement to benefit.  Where questions arise in relation to entitlement, or there is a delay in responding to enquiries from the Department, payment is suspended pending investigation.</p><p>  Changes to EU legislation to modify child benefit entitlements in respect of non-resident children requires the agreement of the European Commission as any proposals for amendments must be tabled by it. I have raised the issue with the Commission and with relevant Ministers from other EU countries. The Commission stressed the importance attached to the system of coordinating social security for the role it plays in encouraging and facilitating free movement of people across the Union. It indicated extreme reluctance to introduce changes along the lines that have been discussed in this country because they would discriminate against migrant workers and would not be in line with judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.</p></reply>

In the case of a family size for the person concerned this rate is &euro;400.20.  All income in excess of this rate, in this case &euro;65.20, must go towards the family contribution towards the rent. In addition there is a minimum statutory contribution of, for a couple, &euro;35.00, giving a total family contribution of &euro;100.20.  This is what the family pay towards their rent; the balance is paid by way of rent supplement.  The rent on the property is &euro;900 per month which equates to &euro;207.70 per week. After the family contribution of &euro;100.20 this leaves a balance of &euro;107.50 per week to be paid by rent supplement. The monthly equivalent of this is &euro;465.80 which is what the person concerned is receiving.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that payments do not continue when a person is imprisoned data matching between the Irish Prison Service (IPS) and this Department is undertaken.  The Department began in 2005 by obtaining the prison data on a twice yearly basis.  Since July 2011, the data is obtained on a weekly basis and is matched against the Department's systems<b>,</b> in accordance with data matching regulations.</p><p>Since receiving prison data on a weekly basis, any social welfare claims in payment are stopped as soon as possible after the person is imprisoned.  In this manner, overpayments are minimised and the opportunity to continue to receive a payment while in prison is virtually eliminated.  If an overpayment has occurred, it is assessed for the period that the person was not entitled to the payment and the recovery of the overpayment is followed up by the Department.  The following tables provide details of the number of overpayments raised as a result of a person being in prison.  A breakdown of these cases between Irish or foreign prisons is not available.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of overpayments raised</th><th>Average amount of overpayment</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>324</td><td>&euro;4,500</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>614</td><td>&euro;3,400</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Not available</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p><p><pcenter>2010 In Prison OPs by Scheme</pcenter><table><tr><th>Disability Allowance</th><th><div>        195 </div></th><th><div>&euro;1,215,749</div></th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Allowance</td><td><div>          86 </div></td><td><div>&euro;124,566</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Contributory</td><td><div>            3 </div></td><td><div>&euro;36,261</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td><div>          40 </div></td><td><div>&euro;92,671</div></td></tr></table><pcenter>2011 In Prison OPs by Scheme</pcenter><table><tr><th>Disability Allowance</th><th><div>        310 </div></th><th><div>&euro;1,443,385</div></th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Allowance</td><td><div>        235 </div></td><td><div>&euro;289,410</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension</td><td><div>            8 </div></td><td><div>&euro;229,115</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Department is not in a position to publicly comment on overpayments recorded in 2012 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The increase in the number of overpayments raised due to imprisonment reflects the fact that the Department is now capturing this information from the IPS in a timely manner and acting on it by raising overpayments in all relevant cases.  The opportunity to commit this type of fraud has been virtually eliminated and the chances of being caught and required to repay any monies received has been substantially improved under the new system of weekly data matching with the IPS.</p></reply>

The Group engaged in a public consultation exercise which provided organisations and individuals with the opportunity to contribute their comments and proposals.  The Report of the Group, which recommended a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July 2011.  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill.  In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.</p><p>  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March 2012 the Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues.  The formal opinion of the Attorney General was received in December 2012 and is currently under consideration by officials in this Department with a view to progressing the draft Heads of the Bill.</p><p>  There are a range of complex and sensitive issues involved in this proposed legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed. I feel that the committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I hope that my officials&rsquo; appearance before the committee can be scheduled before the summer. I believe this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas. When the Oireachtas committee has discussed the provisional draft heads of Bill I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation</p></reply>

All new invalidity pension claims are processed on receipt and a decision issues as soon as all relevant information is available.  At end of March 2013 there were 2,627 invalidity pension claims pending decision all of which have been actioned by a deciding officer.  Some 660 of these invalidity pension cases are EU/Bilateral cases which are awaiting information from another country or EU state and these take considerably longer than domestic cases to finalise.  In addition, claimants who following a negative decision on their claim, exercise their right of review and/or appeal can take significantly longer to process.  The processing time for individual claims can vary depending on the complexity of the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances and the information they provide in support.  In many cases, further information is required in order to make a decision, for example, a medical assessment, information from the claimant themselves or a report from a social welfare inspector on outstanding PRSI contributions or other issues.</p></reply>

That application has, however, been medically assessed at this point.  A recent analysis of the applications pending decision indicated that approximately 60% of them had been waiting for a decision for 12 weeks or fewer.  The general practice is that claims are decided in date of receipt order. However in some instances priority is given to certain claims, for example, claims received from 16 year olds whose parents/guardians had been in receipt of domiciliary care allowance or in cases where claimants are very ill.  The processing time for individual claims can vary depending on the complexity of the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances and the information they provide in support.

Additional CE places will be made available to respond to new proposals.</p><p>- To encourage innovation, new approaches and models of delivery will be encouraged from organisations who are experienced in addressing the needs of long-term unemployed. Approximately 100 places will be reserved for such proposals.

Once the level of FIS payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment. The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks. On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings or other income.  When the 52 week period has expired, customers are invited to re-apply.  If at that stage they continue to satisfy the basic qualifying conditions their up-to-date family income is assessed for FIS purposes and a change in rate is approved if appropriate. </p><p>  In the case of the person concerned their last 52 week payment period for FIS expired on 13 March 2013. The income assessment for their renewal application was based on their family income as it stood in March 2013 and initially their application was refused as the weekly family income exceeded the prescribed income level for the family size.  However, it has subsequently transpired that their rate of One Parent Family Payment is being reduced from 25 April 2013. Accordingly their family income has been re-assessed and FIS has now been awarded at the weekly rate of &euro;20 for the 52 week period from 25 April 2013 to 23 April 2014.  The person concerned will be notified directly of this decision.</p></reply>

Following some small changes required by the Council's Jurist/Linguists, it is anticipated that the final text will be formally adopted by the Council this month.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Recommendation is that Member States should ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will be more gradual in the Member States experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment. The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  With regard to </font>job creation for youth in support of the guarantee, the Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. The government's job-creation policies are outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, which sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. Under the updated Action Plan for 2013,<font color="#2F2F2F"> a new recruitment incentive - JobsPlus - has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer's wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013. </font>  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment. This incentive will be launched for availability by July 2013.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The scale and nature of any additional measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. </font><font color="#2F2F2F">The size and the timescale for any additional provision, over and above that outlined above that is both desirable and feasible will be established over the coming months. </font></p></reply>

T&uacute;s has been able to harness the skills and talents of participants and apply these to the benefit of the local community while they continue to receive a payment based on the value of the prior jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  While the types of work that are undertaken are determined locally, the works that are undertaken must be consistent with the terms and conditions of the scheme, are undertaken by eligible organisations and that particular consideration is given to displacement of existing jobs.  It is a matter for the Board of each implementing body and the selection processes they operate to seek sufficient information and make enquiries to enable an assessment of displacement or deadweight to be determined. </p><p>  Since it commenced on 1st July, 2011, JobBridge has made good progress.  As at 18th April, 2013, 16,545 jobseekers had commenced internships since the scheme was launched.  </p><p>  The Department takes very seriously any allegations of failure to comply with the conditions of T&uacute;s and JobBridge and investigates all such complaints notified to the Department. The Department&rsquo;s own control measures with respect to JobBridge are based on a combination of randomised monitoring visits/inspections with host organisations and on investigation of complaints received from interns.  As of 18th April, 2013, 15 host organisations have been excluded from further participation in JobBridge as a consequence of these control activities.  No reports of displacement has been made with respect to T&uacute;s.</p></reply>

The standardisation of State pension age to 66 is one of the reform measures planned which aims to increase the sustainability of the Irish pension system and this was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011. The State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 will cease from 1st January 2014 and thereafter, will increase to 67 in 2021and 68 in 2028.  People who are affected by the upcoming changes may be able to remain in work until age 66 while others may be able to avail of a social welfare payment where there is an income need.</p><p>  Existing legislation provides that, social welfare supports, such as job seekers benefits, will continue to be available to those who meet the qualifying conditions of the schemes available.  Furthermore, the legislation also provides that for those whose job seekers benefit expires in their 65th year, the payment will continue to be paid up until the age of 66 when State pension becomes payable for those who satisfy the qualifying conditions.  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability </p></reply>

A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24. The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme or T&uacute;s, a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.  </p><p>  I understand that the Deputy has been contacted with regard to these measures by Focus Ireland.  My officials are in contact with Focus Ireland in relation to their concerns.

The EPSCO Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  The Recommendation will now move to be considered for formal adoption by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency - most likely in May.</font></p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.

While much of the expenditure will have related to drilling rigs and seismic vessels, it also relates to expenditure on support and supply vessels and other services sourced at a local level, and the Corrib project has supported in the region of 1,000 direct jobs for several years.</p><p>  The principal future return to Ireland from successful exploration will be through tax paid on profits from petroleum production.  There will also be a secondary benefit in terms of economic activity generated by exploration and more particularly development and production projects.   The main factor that will influence the development of the industry is successful exploration.  The oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells drilled.  To this end my Department encourages exploration investment through an active and targeted promotion campaign, regular licensing rounds and by supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  Maintaining an appropriate fiscal regime is also critical to attracting this much need exploration investment to Ireland.  </p></reply>

To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have, however, made enquiries in relation to this issue, which was mentioned in the course of the recent British Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Letterkenny on 4 March.  I am also aware that Minister of State, Ciaran Cannon, TD, addressed this matter in a Adjournment Debate on 7th   March last.</p><p>  I am advised that the UK Ministry of Defence undertook sea dumping of weapons and munitions as a means of disposing of redundant and surplus stocks and dealing with the legacy of weapons produced in the World Wars.  It is understood that the UK, which at the end of the war in 1945 had a surplus stock of 1.2 million tonnes, was not alone in this process and that most nations at the time disposed of such material by dumping at sea.  The relevant legal framework is the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972, now OSPAR, at which Ireland is usually represented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  In addition to OSPAR, Marine Notice No. 16 of 2001 issued by the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (now a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport) to all fishermen and other users of the sea relates to explosives and other explosive missiles sighted, picked up in trawls at sea or removed from wrecks. This notice covers chemical and conventional munitions and requires all encounters with such munitions to be reported to the Naval Authorities via the Irish Coast Guard Coast Radio Stations. Information on the location and type of munitions dumped in the Convention area was supplied by contracting parties and published by OSPAR in 2005.  The report identified more than 140 dump sites throughout the Convention area and this is believed to be the best information available.  In general terms, the distribution of known Conventional munitions dump sites tends to be in inshore waters whereas chemical weapons were dumped further offshore.</p><p>  I am aware that this issue has given rise to concerns and to be of further assistance to the Deputy, I will arrange for a copy of this question and reply to be forwarded to the Ministers of Environment, Community and Local Government and of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with a request that any additional information be forwarded to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The CER provides quarterly and annual updates on the electricity and gas retail markets, including on disconnections, and further information may be found at:http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-retail-market-reports-and-publications.aspx.</p><p>  Nevertheless, the number of disconnections is a matter of great concern to me as it is for the Government, the CER, voluntary organisations and suppliers.  The rise in disconnections in recent years has coincided with the economic recession, which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.</p><p>  In line with the CER&rsquo;s Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  According to CER&rsquo;s published report on its website on Electricity and Gas Retail Markets, concerning the period to the end of September 2012, over 11,000 Pay as You Go electricity meters have been installed.  That report also states that there are approximately 19,500 token meters in operation.  In relation to gas the report states that for the period to end of September 2012, 63,933 Pay as You Go and token meters are installed, with 36,109 installed since December 2008.  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised, and only occur as a very last resort.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.  In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;18 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in over 10,000 homes.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Waterford, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  NBS services are available within 31 of the 130 Electoral Divisions in County Waterford.  The following table contains a list of these Electoral Divisions.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department will shortly appoint experts, to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.

Whilst methane hydrates may represent a future source of hydrocarbons, methane hydrate extraction and production technologies are still in developmental phase.

The current position is that domestic water charges will not commence before 2014. The Government will be reviewing the timeline for charges with programme partners at the next review of the Programme of Assistance which commences this week.  My Department published the <i>Water Sector Reform Implementation Strategy</i> in October 2012. The implementation strategy sets out the high level milestones under the reform programme.  The strategy is available on my Department's website </p><p>  The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water   company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.  The Government will assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them.  An appropriate approach to charging those customers who may not be metered when charges are introduced will be put in place.  This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair. The approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will be included in a public consultation that will take place as part of the regulatory process.</p></reply>

That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development.  Only developments , or parts of developments, that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.  Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.  To date, over 900 cases have been submitted by lenders.  Of these, 370 borrowers have been engaged with or are in the process of being engaged with by the lender. 25 Sales have now been completed.

The Plan provides for a minimum of 1,000 inspections to be carried out during the twelve-month period commencing in July 2013.  It is a function of the water services authorities (the 34 county and city councils) to implement the Inspection Plan in their functional areas.

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  Real progress is being made in tackling and resolving the issues faced by residents of unfinished estates and the Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort.  The NCC has produced a Guidance Manual on Resolving and Managing Unfinished Estates, a Key Stakeholders Code of Practice, and a Guide for Residents Living in Unfinished Housing Developments, all of which are available at .</p><p>  Site Resolution Plans (SRP's) have been identified by the NCC as a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents.  In this context the activation of bonds and enforcement of planning regulations is a matter solely for the relevant local authority to pursue and my Department has no function in this regard or in regard to the sale of individual privately owned properties.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the housing authority concerned to decide whether or not it is appropriate to accept an application for the above schemes. However, it is of critical importance that authorities apply sound lending criteria in deciding whether to advance house purchase loans in individual cases.

The NSS serves as a strategic context for spatial planning in Ireland by regional authorities in their regional planning guidelines role, and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in their statutory planning functions.  It also seeks to influence investment priorities particularly in transport, housing, water services, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.  The 2002 NSS remains in place, however, I will be bringing proposals to Government later this year for a roadmap to develop a successor strategy that will take account, inter alia, of our significantly changed economic circumstances and to contribute to sustainable national recovery.</p></reply>

Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provides that a household with alternative accommodation that would meet its housing need is ineligible for social housing support. Paragraph (2) of the Regulation clarifies that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. This provision is reasonable in most cases.</p><p>  I acknowledge, however, that situations relating to household members who have separated may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations. My Department is keeping the social housing assessment provisions under review and will consider what wider discretion might be given to housing authorities by way of Regulations to address the individually difficult and complex cases which may present to them.</p></reply>

In 2012 , I introduced a once-off Litter Enforcement Grants Scheme, targeted specifically at the issue of fly tipping and small scale illegal dumping, encouraging local authorities to enhance their existing enforcement activities, through measures such as the purchase of CCTV equipment to allow for the effective monitoring of known litter black spots. I also launched, again in 2012, a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency&rsquo;s National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.   </p><p>  Existing penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences. A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. </p><p>  Following a review of legislation in this area and notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place, my Department is currently preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of a specific on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping. I expect to be in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval shortly.   </p><p>  Enforcement action in relation to illegal dumping is a matter for the relevant local authority concerned and also the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE), which supervises the environmental protection activities of local authorities. My Department provides funding to support the activities of a network of local authority environmental enforcement officers and the OEE. Each local authority sets out an annual programme of action, detailing its planned enforcement action in relation to activities such as illegal dumping, towards which this funding will be utilised. </p><p>  In relation to the issue of &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo;, the Data Protection Commissioner has previously indicated to my Department that actions taken by local authorities in publishing the names and addresses of persons fined or convicted as a result of littering or illegal dumping, whether by publication on their websites or by notices published in the local press and paid for by the local authority, would be in breach of the principles of data protection.  These principles are contained in the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, and in particular, by Section 2A of that Act. Having examined this matter in some detail, I do not plan to introduce legislation allowing for &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo; at this time.</p></reply>

It is important to note, however, that the Directive does not set binding limit values, nor does it prescribe the measures to be included in the action plans, leaving those issues at the discretion of the national competent authorities  .  The production of the revised noise maps is the first step in the review of the noise action plan for the Dublin Agglomeration, which is to be completed by July 2013. The draft Noise Action Plan will be made available for public consultation on the websites of the Dublin-based local authorities, with notices being placed in newspapers inviting submissions from interested parties for consideration before the Plan is finalised. </p><p>  My Department does not provide funding for implementing measures proposed in noise action plans, which is a matter for the relevant noise mapping body. Complaints about local traffic-related noise should be addressed to the relevant roads authority in the first instance.  For national road schemes, potential noise emissions are addressed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process undertaken by, or on behalf of, the National Roads Authority.</p></reply>

These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.

The statutory certificates of completion underpinning the procedures outlined must be signed by a registered professional i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors maintained in accordance with parts 3 and 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or on the register of chartered engineers established under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969. </p><p>  Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate.

In particular, it is worth recalling that the lead role in combating fuel laundering rests with the Revenue Customs Service who work closely with all the relevant law enforcement agencies within the State and from Northern Ireland in tackling this activity. </p><p>  With regard to those responsibilities that fall within the remit of my Department, and particularly in the context of cross border cooperation in the investigation of organised crime, I can inform the Deputy that the issue of fuel laundering does, of course, feature in discussions at the various fora established for the purpose of promoting such cooperation.  As highlighted in the Cross Border Threat Assessment for 2012, fuel laundering continues to be a serious concern for authorities, North and South. Recognising this shared concern a Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group Task Force, comprising representatives from PSNI, HM Revenue Customs, SOCA (UK), the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau has been established to target these activities on an all island basis. </p><p>  The annual Cross Border Seminar on Organised Crime, which is an important event in the law enforcement calendar for agencies on both sides of the border, provides an opportunity to assess and address the ever changing trends in crime and the related Cross Border Threat Assessment.  This seminar is organised jointly each year between the Department of Justice Northern Ireland and my Department.  Such cross border co-operation is further reflected in the joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  </p><p>  At political level, I meet and maintain contact very regularly with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to address matters of mutual concern and enhance effective co-operation and co-ordination on all criminal justice matters.  Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters we operate a structured framework to further develop this co-operation.  Officials from our Departments also meet regularly to assess and report to us on developments in these matters.  In concluding, I can assure the Deputy that there continues to be comprehensive and positive North-South co-operation in combating all forms of cross border crime.</p></reply>

The sentences that can never become spent under the Bill are:  (1) a sentence of imprisonment of more than 12 months (except in the case of a sentence of up to 24 months which is fully suspended and the suspension is not subsequently revoked in whole or in part); (2) a sentence imposed for an offence that is reserved for trial by the Central Criminal Court; and (3) a sentence imposed for a sexual offence.</p><p>  A maximum of 2 convictions may become spent under the Bill.  However, where a person is convicted of more than one offence at a single court sitting, the convictions may be treated as one conviction for the purpose of this limit.  There are a number of situations where the provisions of the Bill do not apply and a person will still have to disclose all convictions.  These include where the person wishes to work with children or vulnerable persons, work in certain positions in the civil and public service, or apply for certain licences.</p></reply>

The situation is unchanged since then.  The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order signed on 11th September 2003. He evaded his deportation for almost 6 years until June 2009. In 2009 the individual  made an application to have his Deportation Order revoked under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Having considered the application fully, the Deportation Order was affirmed and this decision was conveyed to the applicant and copied to his legal representative on 29th June 2011.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the application for asylum made by the person concerned was fairly and comprehensively examined. The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.

The initial commitment was to publish the Bill in Quarter 1 of 2012. However, given the complexities involved in drafting comprehensive reform legislation of this nature, the deadline was ultimately extended to the end of June 2012.  The commitment to the Troika was met by the publication of the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 on 29 June, 2012.</p><p>  The  Troika team was in Dublin in January 2013 as part of their normal quarterly review of the Programme of Financial Support for Ireland and met with officials from my Department as part of that review process.  The Troika team noted the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which represented significant progress since their last visit. The measures being taken by my Department, the Insolvency Service and other relevant parties to bring about the full operation of the new debt resolution processes were discussed.  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012, was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 December, 2012 and signed into law by the President on 26 December, 2012.</p><p>  Part 6 of the Act was commenced on 18 January 2013.  The provisions of Part 1 (other than section 6), Part 2 (other than section 13), sections 25 and 47, sections 126 to 141, Part 5 and Schedules 2 and 3 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 came into operation on 1 March 2013<font color="#0000FF">. </font>  The Insolvency Service was established on 1 March 2013 by Ministerial Order made on 20 February last.</p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) Public Information Campaign was formally launched on 18 April, 2013.  Since the Director of the Service took up his position at the end of last October, he has overseen a great deal of work within a short period of time.  This included setting up an implementation team to address all of the operational matters necessary for the new Service; arranging office accommodation; recruiting and training specialist staff; and designing and implementing the new regulatory and IT frameworks required to accept applications. The dedicated ISI website and information line went live on 18 April. Trained ISI staff have begun taking calls from the public and will be able to advise people in regard to which debt resolution process may be most appropriate to their situation from the three new processes available.</p><p>  The Act will be fully commenced as soon as all of the remaining necessary preparations for administration of its provisions are finalised which is expected by the end of June 2013.</p></reply>

There are currently 35 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to approximately 4,800 persons.  It is worth noting the decline in the number of persons seeking accommodation in the RIA system in recent years.  During the four year period ending on 31 December, 2012, RIA had closed 25 centres and was accommodating 2,161 fewer persons. During this period, RIA spending had declined from &euro;91.5 million to &euro;62.3 million i.e.32%.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i>   I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens. </p><p>  In relation to the broader asylum issue, I acknowledge that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  The system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.</p></reply>

The Bill also makes provision, as part of these undertakings, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State. These are key reforms that should reduce the number<b></b>of court proceedings that arise under the current, multi-layered regulatory framework and, by the same token, reduce the waiting time for a final decision.  These are among the many aspects of the Bill that are under ongoing consideration at my Department, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General, and will modernise and streamline the current immigration regime. </p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members including those being raised by the Deputy on this occasion. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts. It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of our having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year. </p><p>  In addition, and with a view to streamlining the management and processing by the Courts of applications for judicial review in the asylum and immigration areas, I propose to bring forward proposals to amend the statutory provisions relating to judicial review which are set out in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.</p></reply>

The essential role of JPCs is to provide appropriate advice to the Garda&iacute; and local authorities and to support collaborative engagement among stakeholders in relation to local policing issues.</p><p>  In relation to the costs associated with JPCs, it is important to note that the Committees are intended as a forum to improve collaboration and engagement between relevant agencies and stakeholders and are not intended to undertake new administrative functions with corresponding budgets and other resources.  There are already substantial resources deployed to addressing local policing and community safety issues and the JPCs are intended to enhance how these resources are deployed,  not supplement them. Therefore each agency involved in the Committees is generally expected to meet the expenses arising for itself in establishing and operating the JPCs from within its existing resources.</p><p>  The current operating guidelines for JPCs were issued in 2008 and these envisage that quarterly meetings of JPCs would be the norm.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has appointed appropriate officers to each of the Joint Policing Committees in accordance with the guidelines. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are essential participants in the JPC process and attend meetings at the times and dates specified by the respective local authority.  I am further informed that it is not possible to provide details of the attendance of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the meetings of the 114 JPCs as a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources would be required to compile this information. In this regard it should be noted that further information concerning each JPC is available from the relevant local authority.</p><p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Garda&iacute;.  In the spirit of that commitment I initiated a review of the operation of JPCs and, on 29 November 2012, I published a discussion document to open the matter for wider consultation.  My Department, together with the Garda authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is examining the feedback received during the consultation process, to see if any amendments should be made to the existing guidelines which would enhance the operation of JPCs. The Deputy will also appreciate that the review process will need to take into account the broader developments with respect to local government reform which are underway and the implications of this reform for the operation of JPCs.</p></reply>

While the general principle is that justice be administered in public, the underlying concern is that family law proceedings relate to matters which are sensitive and private to the parties and there is no public interest in requiring that their identities be published.</p><p>  The application of the <i>in camera </i>  rule in relation to court hearing of family law and child care proceedings has given rise to a public perception that undue secrecy is attached to the administration of these areas of the law and that there is a lack of uniformity and consistency in the manner in which they are administered.</p><p>  The proposal in the Bill is to retain the privacy provisions in respect of such court proceedings while allowing the attendance of <i>bona fide </i>  representatives of the press.  The courts will, however, retain the power to exclude representatives of the Press or restrict or prohibit the publication of evidence given in the proceedings in certain circumstances.  In addition, a strict prohibition will apply on reporting of material likely to identify the parties to the proceedings or any children to whom the proceedings relate.  The Bill aims to provide for a careful balancing of the need for privacy for persons involved in family law and child care proceedings with the need to ensure access to important information on the operation of family and child care law in our courts.  The Bill is currently before the Seanad and I hope to progress the Bill before the Oireachtas with a view to its enactment before the Summer recess.</p></reply>

He has been evading his deportation since 19 May 2005 and should he come to the notice of the Garda&iacute;, he would be liable to arrest and detention.

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.

The position with regard to my Department is unchanged since then and was stated as follows.</p><p>  <i>There are no current plans to engage in any form of blanket regularisation of migrants who are unlawfully in the State. It is the responsibility of all non EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality. Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.</i></p><p><i>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis taking account of their individual circumstances. At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed the Department continues to deal with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis. However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct.</i></p><p><i>  At EU level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &#8220;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&#8221;. While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases. In our case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</i></p><p><i>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State such as the welfare, health, housing and education areas, along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.</i></p><p><i>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant. However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home. That decision should be respected.</i></p></reply>

Work is well advanced on this and it will include guidelines on all of the main issues including eligibility, dependency, the financial resources necessary to sponsor a dependant and any personal requirements the person seeking entry must meet. The purpose is to update the existing policies in operation and to address any gaps in the current regime in the interests of applicants, practitioners and staff.</p><p>  Ireland already provides significant possibilities for family reunification and substantial numbers of cases are processed annually.  It should also be noted that our existing policies in respect of certain classes of migration, for high skilled workers, researchers, PhD students, entrepreneurs and investors, providing for immediate family reunification of spouse and dependent children, would compare very favourably with many other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

In this context, unfortunately, the situation that we now face is that there is currently no new agreement on public pay issues but there is still a projected &euro;300 million budgetary shortfall in 2013.

These figures include the most recent promotions to Inspector and Sergeant ranks on 28th March 2013 but do not include appointments to the rank of Superintendent (14) and Chief Superintendent (4) which are expected in the very near future.  While regulations have previously provided for the numbers permitted in each rank, these have been upper ceilings for those numbers, rather than target strengths, and are set at a national rather than local level.

Benefits under the schemes are additional to Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension that may be payable under the Social Welfare Acts in respect of deceased personnel by virtue of their social insurance (PRSI) contributions.  Provision for the payment of pensions by my Department to the spouses and children of deceased Enlisted Personnel of the Permanent Defence Force was first made in 1978 when a Contributory Pension Scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Personnel serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  In 1985, Enlisted Personnel were given a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants when all those who had opted out of the original scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  The deceased spouse of the person in question therefore had two opportunities to join the scheme, but he opted not to do so.  In the circumstances, I regret that the person in question is not eligible for a pension from my Department.  However, she should contact the Department of Social Protection, as she may be entitled to a pension or other benefits from that Department.</p></reply>

The provision of compensation has to be placed in the context of the economic benefits accruing to farmers arising from the eradication of this disease and, particularly, the short payback time involved for individual farmers as well as the scarce budgetary resources available to my Department.  The strategy of my Department is to concentrate its scarce resources in continuing to support Animal Health Ireland in its ongoing work to enhance the value for beef and dairy farmers through superior animal health and in establishing control programmes for non-regulated diseases of livestock in Ireland.</p></reply>

By way of update on the matter, further to the Government's decision that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests be considered for sale, NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have worked to examine the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte's forest assets.  Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.  These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.  I note that these are also the issues raised by the Donegal Woodland Owners Society Limited.</p><p>  The Government is fully conscious of such concerns in relation to the Coillte sale proposal.  A number of these issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il debate on the proposal on 26 and 27 February last.  While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has yet been taken.  The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion.  In relation to the ownership of the company, Coillte was established as a private company in accordance with the Forestry Act 1988, which also provided for the issue of shares to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is therefore a State owned company.  I wish to reiterate that it is the sale of the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests that is under consideration and not the sale of the land or the company.</p></reply>

Difficult conditions experienced on farms last summer have been compounded by an extended winter. </p><p>  I am receiving daily updates from Teagasc on the situation and I have asked that for this crucial period, top priority is given to supporting farmers in need of assistance.  I have also been speaking to banks, co-ops and grain and feed merchants to highlight the challenges facing farmers as a result of the weather, and insisting they take a flexible approach to dealing with short term credit issues. Contact is being maintained with the co-operatives and some have commenced sourcing fodder supplies in the United Kingdom. I will be meeting with representative from banks and co-operatives tomorrow.</p><p>  In relation to the measures which can be taken to alleviate the problems on farms, I would urge farmers to also contact their local agricultural advisor.  Where winter fodder is limited, advisors can provide specific advice and assistance on how to cope with the consequences of the weather conditions experienced this Spring.  I am keeping this matter under constant review.</p></reply>

The presence of equine DNA discovered in a single burger here ultimately uncovered a pan European problem.  I arranged, in my role as President of the Agriculture Council, to have the matter discussed at EU level and the Commission promptly proposed the EU testing programme, the results of which were published on 16 April.</p><p>  The results show that, across the EU, there were 4,144 tests under the equine DNA programme of which 193 were positive.  In Ireland, all of the results of the 50 DNA tests on Irish beef products under the EU programme were negative.  In addition there were 7,951 tests reported for equine DNA carried out by food business operators across the EU, of which 110 were positive.  Under the Irish national DNA testing regime the results of  2,185 DNA tests published by the FSAI to date showed only a small number of positives (32 representing 9 products), all of which were published previously and related to products withdrawn from the market.</p><p>  Consideration is being given at EU level to the outcome of these tests to determine what further action is required.  In the meantime, DNA testing is being carried out under national protocol by food business operators in Ireland and the results are being published by the FSAI. </p></reply>

The EU Food Hygiene regulations which are the principal basis of our food safety system do not cover food quality issues and do not mention food spoilage or this organism.  Accordingly this is not a focus of official controls in approved meat plants and in the circumstances responsibility for dealing with the matter rests with industry.</p><p>  In October 2009 Teagasc published a report on the Control of Blown Package Spoilage in Vacuum Packaged Meat.  This report concluded that: &quot;Blown pack spoilage (BPS) represents a significant commercial loss to Irish meat processors.  This research discovered that the organisms causing BPS are ubiquitous in the abattoir environment, making eradication very difficult.  The risk of BPS is best managed through a process of regular treatment of plant and equipment with a sporicidal agent such as peroxyacetic acid, good hygiene to minimise carcass contamination and removal of the heat shrinkage stage during vacuum packaging as this activates the spores and reduces the time to spoilage.&quot;</p><p>  The report provides guidance to industry on minimising the risk of this problem.  The research, which was funded by my Department and carried out by Teagasc, discovered a new Blown Pack Spoilage Clostridia species (<i>C. ruminantium</i>); delivered key data and demonstrated the detrimental effect of vacuum packaging heat shrinkage in spore activation.  As a result of this work,<i></i>Teagasc's food research centre in Ashtown, Co. Dublin developed a PCR assay to detect the problem and is now offering a testing service to the meat industry and other food industries.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is about to fund a new research project which will include an investigation of issues associated with <i>C. estertheticum </i>and to develop and validate a rapid real time PCR assay capable of detecting and enumerating <i>C. estertheticum,</i><i>C. gasigenes</i> and <i>C. ruminantium</i> .</p></reply>

The scheme was initially Exchequer funded under a pilot scheme from 2007-2009 and has been co-funded by the EU under the Rural Development Programme since 2010.  My Department has no role in relation to commercial arrangements between individual farmers and contractors for the end use of their energy crops.  The pricing of product is also a commercial matter.</p><p>  In February 2012, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, T.D., introduced REFIT supports for bioenergy, including tariffs to support Biomass Combined Heat and Power and Biomass Combustion.  These tariffs are designed to provide financial incentives for the end use of energy crops, including miscanthus.  In December 2011, I amended the terms and conditions of the Bioenergy Scheme so as to remove the obligation on growers to maintain the crop for seven years as a condition of retaining grant-aid.  This afforded an opportunity for growers who wished to exit the scheme to do so without penalty and was available to all growers including those who had established crops since the commencement of the scheme in 2007.</p></reply>

The initiative is expected to receive funding of &euro;14 million to provide, in a full year, in the region of 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school, in order to support parents to take up employment.  </p><p>  Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of these opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment.  Preparations are well advanced for the introduction of a pilot project in a small number of locations with the national roll-out of the programme planned for September this year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme. Service providers seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner. </p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot phase of the programme will be evaluated to establish if the programme meets this objective and, if necessary, to identify areas where corrective action is required.</p></reply>

Childcare services participating in the ECCE programme are paid a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child enrolled for the free pre-school year.  Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs), for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate, the pre-school leader must hold a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full Level 7 award on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and meet other conditions as set out by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  A joint  inspection pilot conducted by the HSE  Inspectorate and the Department of Education and Skills was recently completed.  It is anticipated that the learning from this project will inform the debate on the future development of the pre-school  inspection system.</p></reply>

I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.</p><p>  The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years and a  National Implementation Group has been established   to oversee the progress and challenges in improving services and outcomes for young people leaving care.  The Group is comprised of representatives of funded services providers such as Focus Ireland and other advocacy organisations, as well as representatives of foster carers and other groups.  They have found  an  increasingly systematic approach across the country  to young people around age sixteen being identified through the care planning review process and a standardised aftercare planning template. This approach is helping the early identification of young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, and has led to good examples of inter-agency working. There have also been some improvements in the data available although more work is required in this area and in rolling out fully standardised financial allowances.</p><p>  The HSE's annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million. There are currently 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE; additionally, the HSE commissions aftercare services, residential and support in the community, from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care across the country.  The HSE have advised me that approximately 500 young people reach the age of 18 in care every year, with 412 young people in care reaching their 18th birthday in 2012.</p><p>  At the end of December 2012:</p><p>  - 639 young people over the age of 18 years were supported financially to remain living with their foster carers. These young people did not have to face the transition of leaving their foster carers at age 18 and for many, in addition to having access to an after care worker,  they received their key support from their foster carers.</p><p>  - 110 young people were living in supported living arrangements and had an aftercare key worker.</p><p>  - there were 384 young people over 21 receiving some aspect of aftercare support; the remaining 1073 were between 18 and 21.</p><p> -  599 of the total number  were in full time education.</p><p> - a further 656 were in some form of education and training.</p><p>  Given the particular difficulties of some young people in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.  The Aftercare Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care and the Department of the Environment regarding housing to support this approach.  A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. </p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of an aftercare service but more work remains to be done.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people and the information provided will inform the policy development being undertaken to underpin aftercare in legislation.</p></reply>

The pilot, which involves the Irish Air Corps and the HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS), was established to obtain operational and clinical data for this type of service in an Irish context, in order to inform policy decisions on the future provision of such services.  A review of the pilot is being carried out by the EAS Audit and Evaluation Group, comprising representatives from the NAS, including its Medical Director, the Air Corps and the Departments of Health and Defence, as required by the Memorandum of Understanding between the departments which established the pilot.  The review is focussed on data in relation to operational issues and clinical outcomes arising from the pilot, with a view to agreeing recommendations, in the event that a decision is made to provide this type of service, on how best to proceed.  The Group's report is expected to be completed before the end of the pilot. I will consider its recommendations at that time.</p></reply>

Any alternative route to membership of the College must be approved by the ICGP and must be of equivalent standard to the conventional route to membership, i.e. formal training undertaken in an accredited GP training programme and completion of end point assessment - the MICGP examination.</p><p>  In March 2009, the College sought a declaration of interest in order to gauge the level of interest in the alternative route to membership.  In the interim, consideration needed to be given to the criteria for eligibility, possible models of assessment and the budgetary and funding implications.  In February 2012, an online pre-application questionnaire was carried out to determine the number of potential applicants who may be eligible.  173 applicants responded, 135 approx. of whom are likely to meet the criteria and also meet the requirements in order to engage in the assessment process.  A programme director was formally appointed for this project in May 2012 and work is underway to set up the structures and processes required to implement the alternative route.  The various assessment components are being prepared for pilot at present.  The College will open the process for the taking of applications from 23 April 23, 2013.</p><p>  The eligibility criteria for application for this route to membership have been agreed by the ICGP Postgraduate Training Committee and this was endorsed by the Council of the College in March 2011.  It details the minimum requirements with regard to GP experience and training and attainment of this experience and training within defined dates.  Of its nature, selection criteria may exclude some applicants.  It is impossible to comment on an individual doctor's eligibility for participation in the Alternative Route Programme until they formally apply and supply the necessary details to the programme team for assessment. All information will be updated on the ICGP website after 23 April 23 on the following link: </p></reply>

This event provides a forum for wider public consultation and discussion on social inclusion issues, in particular for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and the groups that work with them.  The forum has ensured that such stakeholders have a voice in the development of the policies that directly affect them, and how they are implemented.  The Social Inclusion Forum is convened by the Department of Social Protection.  In relation to disability funding, this Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2013, and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.  In 2013 the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012,  by providing the following specialist disability services:	residential services to over 9,000 people with a disability; day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; respite residential support for over 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.  The Government and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant services available to persons with disabilities.  In the 2013 National Service Plan (NSP), the HSE's priority is to maximise the provision of services to people with disabilities within available resources and to maintain a consistent level to that provided for in 2012, including the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.</p><p>  The demand for life-skills training and day services for school-leavers with disabilities continues to grow.  The HSE expects that approximately 700 school-leavers will require services in 2013.  I am pleased to confirm that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4 million to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on the percentage of population.  The recommendations of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services (New Directions) will guide the reconfiguration and modernisation of HSE funded adult day services and will underpin the collaborative action in terms of flexibility and innovation when addressing requirements for school leavers in 2013.  Currently the National Disability Unit is liaising with the Regional Leads for Disability Services in terms of a cohesive and collaborative approach to meeting the needs of school leavers within the resources available.  Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of this funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible.</p></reply>

The end point is that countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies preferably by the end of 2013.  In 2011, I established a Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the Council Recommendation on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Since that time work has been progressing steadily on the development of the Plan.  This has included a Consultation Event with stakeholders in Farmleigh last June followed by an on-line consultation.  Work on the drafting of the plan is well underway and it is my intention to publish the Plan by the end of this year.</p></reply>

I do accept that there is a need for the use of sunbeds to be restricted, especially for children, because of the increased risk of skin cancer and other health problems.  The Government has approved the drafting of legislation in this regard.  This legislation will prohibit the use of sunbeds on a sunbed premises by persons under 18 years of age and will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include: (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises; (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age; (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises; (iv) an exemption for medical purposes; (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE; (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear to users; (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises; (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices; (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the drafting of this legislation.  It is important to bear in mind that the Bill, when finalised, must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive <i>prior</i> to the publication and introduction of the Bill in the Oireachtas.  This EU notification requirement will necessitate a minimum of three months to complete.</p></reply>

One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Regulations regarding fluoridation of public water supplies to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm.  Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.  The fluoride currently used is sourced as a primary product; it is mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar as calcium fluoride (CaF2).  It then goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluorosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.</p><p>  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.</p></reply>

The HSE also recognise the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes and communities in accordance with Government policy. Home helps play a vital role in enabling people to continue to live at home and this policy will continue to be a key feature of health service delivery. The Government will make every effort, despite significant resource pressures, to protect front-line home support services for vulnerable older people and to facilitate the development of the home help service.</p><p>  While the HSE announced a reduction in the provision of home help hours as one of a number of measures required to address the significant 2012 budget deficit last October, this was subject to home help services continuing to be available to those assessed as requiring them. The HSE&rsquo;s 2013 Service Plan includes the provision of 10.3 million hours of home help service, the same level as planned for in 2012.</p><p>  The number of hours worked by home help assistants varies according to service needs. Their terms and conditions were covered by an agreement negotiated with the representative unions in 2009.  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning the contracts of home help assistants.  The Court issued a further recommendation on 12 December 2012 noting that management proposals to deal with the issues raised would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services. The parties have since met on a number of occasions in relation to contractual issues under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and this engagement is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides support to individuals, not to nursing homes. In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  The NTPF assesses nursing home process under four criteria:</p><p>  -	costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p><p>  -	price(s) previously charged,</p><p>  -	local market price, and</p><p>  -	Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>  An NTPF pricing agreement is in place with the nursing home referred to by the Deputy.  It is scheduled for renewal on 1 July 2013 and NTPF are currently in contact with the proprietors concerning that renewal.</p></reply>

The HSE National Service Plan 2013 commits to a number of objectives including the further development of suicide prevention initiatives and forensic services; community mental health teams for adults, children and older persons and for mental health intellectual disability; and to the recruitment of 477 additional staff to implement these measures.  </p><p>  In order to ensure that the additional resources will be used to best effect, the HSE, in consultation with the Department of Health, is working towards finalising the allocation of these resources.  Business cases from each HSE Region are being finalised and examined, against each of the identified objectives, detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  It is expected that this process will be concluded in the very near future with a view to recruitment of the additional staff proceeding as soon as possible. 384 of the 414 posts approved in 2012 have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  I have been assured by the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013 and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012 is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention recognises the youth sector as a high risk group and sets out a number of specific actions.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   </p><p>  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &euro;13 million.  Over &euro;8 million of this is provided to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.  This includes an additional &euro;1 million from the &euro;35 million allocation for 2013 (above).  The remaining &euro;5 million for suicide prevention is available regionally to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.</p><p>The NOSP is reviewing its current activities to make the  most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  This will result in a revised strategic approach for 2013 and will inform the final phase of <i>Reach Out,</i>  our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention which runs until 2014.  I expect that the HSE will approve the revised approach in the very near future.</p><p>  This reviewed approach will build on progress made to date, which includes the provision of awareness and training programmes such as safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), National Mental Health Awareness Campaigns as well as the Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health &amp;amp; Suicide Prevention which were jointly developed with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

Consequently, the HSE is taking  a number of measures to reduce the cost of the General Medical Service (GMS) Scheme.  In addition to the reduction in the income limits for over-70s Medical Cards, the assessment criteria for the standard medical card is being changed.  Home Improvement Loan payments and a &euro;50 per week car allowance in Travel-to-Work expenses, as referred to by the Deputy will, in future, be excluded from consideration in the means test assessment.</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the changes were  identified as the expenses that would best mitigate the impact of removal of  some allowable expenses in the assessment process while also yielding the requisite savings. In so doing, the need to reduce the income limits for medical cards was avoided.  In addition, the new arrangements continue to fully take account of a person's mortgage or rental expenses. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005-2011, charges apply for in-patient services other than for acute hospital care and for long-term residential care services supported under the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Fair Deal), both of which are subject to separate charging regimes. Under these Regulations, the HSE must apply charges (subject to certain exemptions) to all those who receive in-patient services for longer than 30 days over a rolling 12 month period. <b></b>Charges apply whether or not the person has full or limited eligibility. </p><p>  I understand that directions to ensure the uniform application of the existing legislation on charges for in-patient respite care services across all HSE areas were circulated by the HSE at the end of March 2013 for implementation with immediate effect. This development brought areas that were not charging for in-patient respite care services into line with other areas that were already charging for such services. As a result, and in the interests of fairness and equity, in-patient respite care charges have now been implemented in all areas on a standard and consistent basis in  accordance with the legislation in place since 2005.</p><p>  The level of the charges is based on income and cannot exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension. The Regulations currently provide for a maximum charge of &euro;175 per week where in-patient care is provided in a setting with 24-hour nursing care or a maximum of &euro;130 per week where in-patient care is provided in other settings.  The charging legislation provides that the HSE may reduce or waive charges where necessary to avoid financial hardship, having regard to individual financial circumstances (including whether there are dependants).</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.   Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

The current Programme for Government includes a specific commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA. The standards have been submitted to my Department for approval and I expect that they will be formally approved shortly with a likely publication and launch of the standards next month.    </p><p>  Work is also underway in the Department on both the &lsquo;Registration and Inspection&rsquo; regulations and the &lsquo;Care and Welfare&rsquo; regulations required to bring the standards into law.  These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned with the introduction three years ago of similar regulations for nursing homes.</p><p>  It is expected that the new regulatory regime should be up and running by quarter three this year.  This timescale, however, is subject to final agreement on the staffing and resources required in addition to the necessity to recruit and train the inspectorate staff in time for the commencement of the regulatory regime.  Every effort is being made to ensure that the required staff are in place to commence registration and inspection of this sector later this year.  </p><p>  It is also important to point out that while the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with these standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector. </p></reply>

The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is not a static service. The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.</p><p>  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has been addressing response times through a number of measures, including:</p><p>- the Performance Improvement Action Plan, focussing on local issues such as call taking and dispatch, faster crew mobilisation and community first responder schemes;</p><p>- the intermediate care service (ICS), for non-emergency ambulance transport, such as inter-hospital transfers, freeing emergency vehicles for emergency calls:  nearly 40 ICS staff were appointed last year, with further resources to be deployed in 2013;</p><p>- the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), which reduces transit times, particularly in the West, and allows emergency vehicles to remain within their regions;</p><p>- the national control centre reconfiguration, with one national control system on two sites - Tallaght and Ballyshannon - for improved dispatch and response times, with regional, rather than local, deployment and better use of first responder schemes.</p><p>  These measures, together with more effective use of existing resources, for example with improved training and better deployment through more efficient rostering,  will drive the improvement of response times in every region.  This will lead to better services and better outcomes when our citizens need these services.</p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy regarding the proposal  to invest &euro;12m in the ambulance service in 2013,  as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Last December, the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i>   case.  Intensive work is underway in my Department on drafting this legislation and it is the Government's intention that the Heads of a Bill will be published in April.</p></reply>

Beechpark is a regional HSE service which provides clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder up to 18 years of age who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The service has to operate within the financial and other parameters applying.</p><p>  Importantly, the Beechpark service is working with local implementation groups to progress disability services for children and young people across the HSE's Dublin north-east and Dublin-mid-Leinster areas.  They are focussing on the current service model and service delivery structure provided by all service providers in the area, with a view to addressing the realignment of resources in the context of the report of the national reference group, the national review of autism services report and the progressing disability services programme.  This issue is also being examined by the independent Dublin Beechpark service review group.</p><p>  While the current economic position presents challenges in how best to maximise the provision of services with available resources, I am committed to protecting front-line services, including children's disability and autism services to the greatest extent possible.  In that context, I have raised my concerns with the HSE regarding staff rotation and the impact of the public sector recruitment moratorium on front-line staff, especially therapists.  I will also continue to work closely with the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to address this matter. </p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time  data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment. </p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the Special Delivery Unit will  also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.  In relation to this particular query raised by the Deputy, I have asked the Health Service Executive to investigate the situation and respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Therefore, it is inaccurate to suggest that termination will be permitted in cases where there are mental health risks - rather it will only be permitted where it is established by expert medical opinion that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i> case.  The aim of the Bill is to bring clarity and certainty in relation to the process for the determination of whether a termination of pregnancy is permissible on the basis that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman as a result of that pregnancy.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  This includes gluten-free products.</p><p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: <i>.</i>  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes. </p></reply>

While my immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the twelve professions currently designated under the Act, I am committed to bringing counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work done by a number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups in coming together as the Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice in so far as is possible.  There are a number of issues still to be clarified, however.  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession.  The QQI Report is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2014.  In addition, the standards of proficiency to be required of existing practitioners for registration will need to be established and the necessary qualifications prescribed.</p><p>  Officials of my Department will be engaging with the Psychological Therapies Forum and other relevant stakeholders as soon as the QQI report is available. They will work through the outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed with a view to achieving regulation of the profession as soon as possible in the best interests of the protection of the public.  I would like to emphasise that while counsellors and psychotherapists are not currently subject to professional statutory regulation, they are of course subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.</p></reply>

The Review covered the period 2002 to 2009.</p><p>- Key findings of the Review include:</p><p>- Concerns over the value for money in the context of a rate of increase in Programme funding without an accompanying equivalent increase in passenger numbers or services </p><p>- The current organisational structure for delivery (35 RTP groups) is a key factor in the lack of cost efficiencies being achieved both in administration and operations</p><p>- The cost of administration has been and remains very high as a proportion of total RTP group expenditure (22% in 2009)</p><p>- Substantial increases in operating costs - between 2007 and 2009 wages and salaries doubled as a consequence of increased staffing and salary levels</p><p>- Lack of data to measure the benefits of the Programme in terms of addressing social inclusion objectives and data gaps in the framework of performance monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>  The Review made a number of recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Programme.  The NTA was tasked with implementing the findings of the Review.</p><p>  The main recommendations of the report are:</p><p>  - Reduce overall Programme costs particularly the administration costs</p><p>  - Improve efficiency of the Programm</p><p>  - Address the status of the Programme within the context of public transport regulation in Ireland</p><p>  - Develop a detailed appraisal plan for an organisational restructuring to achieve greater programme efficiencies</p><p>  - Better alignment to be established between the voluntary county-based RTP groups involved and the Local Authorities</p><p>  Administration costs to the Programme were reduced by 33.5 % by end 2012.  Combined with the reduction in Pobal's costs, the threshold administration proportion of 17% recommended in the VfM Review was also achieved by end 2012.  In order to achieve the recommended administration costs of 13%, the proposed restructuring of the RTP is required.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.</p><p>  The RTP budget for 2014 - 2015 will be determined as part of the estimates and budgetary process for these years.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  </p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   </p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.   </p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding the County Donegal area or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   </p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>

Benefits under the schemes are additional to Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension that may be payable under the Social Welfare Acts in respect of deceased personnel by virtue of their social insurance (PRSI) contributions.  Provision for the payment of pensions by my Department to the spouses and children of deceased Enlisted Personnel of the Permanent Defence Force was first made in 1978 when a Contributory Pension Scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Personnel serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  In 1985, Enlisted Personnel were given a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants when all those who had opted out of the original scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  The deceased spouse of the person in question therefore had two opportunities to join the scheme, but he opted not to do so.  In the circumstances, I regret that the person in question is not eligible for a pension from my Department.  However, she should contact the Department of Social Protection, as she may be entitled to a pension or other benefits from that Department.</p></reply>

By way of update on the matter, further to the Government's decision that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests be considered for sale, NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have worked to examine the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte's forest assets.  Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.  These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.  I note that these are also the issues raised by the Donegal Woodland Owners Society Limited.</p><p>  The Government is fully conscious of such concerns in relation to the Coillte sale proposal.  A number of these issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il debate on the proposal on 26 and 27 February last.  While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has yet been taken.  The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion.  In relation to the ownership of the company, Coillte was established as a private company in accordance with the Forestry Act 1988, which also provided for the issue of shares to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is therefore a State owned company.  I wish to reiterate that it is the sale of the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests that is under consideration and not the sale of the land or the company.</p></reply>

Following consideration of an appeal, the revised position is that the total over claim has been determined to be less than 50% and therefore an administrative fine will not now apply.

The presence of equine DNA discovered in a single burger here ultimately uncovered a pan European problem.  I arranged, in my role as President of the Agriculture Council, to have the matter discussed at EU level and the Commission promptly proposed the EU testing programme, the results of which were published on 16 April.</p><p>  The results show that, across the EU, there were 4,144 tests under the equine DNA programme of which 193 were positive.  In Ireland, all of the results of the 50 DNA tests on Irish beef products under the EU programme were negative.  In addition there were 7,951 tests reported for equine DNA carried out by food business operators across the EU, of which 110 were positive.  Under the Irish national DNA testing regime the results of  2,185 DNA tests published by the FSAI to date showed only a small number of positives (32 representing 9 products), all of which were published previously and related to products withdrawn from the market.</p><p>  Consideration is being given at EU level to the outcome of these tests to determine what further action is required.  In the meantime, DNA testing is being carried out under national protocol by food business operators in Ireland and the results are being published by the FSAI. </p></reply>

The figures show that the size of the suckler cow herd has remained relatively stable over the last 12 years albeit with a gradual decline recorded in the overall population.  However, the December 2012 results show a 4% increase in the numerical strength of the herd relative to 2011 as high cattle prices in recent years have encouraged beef producers to restock their herds.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th><div>Beef  /  Suckler Cow Herd<br />&amp;#8216;000 head</div></th></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td><div>1,155.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td><div>1,159.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td><div>1,150.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td><div>1,144.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td><div>1,150.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td><div>1,150.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td><div>1,128.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td><div>1,117.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td><div>1,175.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td><div>1,134.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>2010*</td><td><div>1,090.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>2011*</td><td><div>1,083.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td><div>1,127.9</div></td></tr></table></p><p><i>Source: CSO December Livestock Survey</i></p><p>*Revised data.</p></reply>

During these checks an overclaim was identified in relation to the claimed areas on the Natura Owned action which resulted in a area reduction on the application. The 75% payment totalling &euro;999.99 in respect of the 2011 scheme year issued on 7 December 2012 and the balancing 25% payment (net of reduction) of &euro;325.98 has recently issued.

The EU Food Hygiene regulations which are the principal basis of our food safety system do not cover food quality issues and do not mention food spoilage or this organism.  Accordingly this is not a focus of official controls in approved meat plants and in the circumstances responsibility for dealing with the matter rests with industry.</p><p>  In October 2009 Teagasc published a report on the Control of Blown Package Spoilage in Vacuum Packaged Meat.  This report concluded that: &quot;Blown pack spoilage (BPS) represents a significant commercial loss to Irish meat processors.  This research discovered that the organisms causing BPS are ubiquitous in the abattoir environment, making eradication very difficult.  The risk of BPS is best managed through a process of regular treatment of plant and equipment with a sporicidal agent such as peroxyacetic acid, good hygiene to minimise carcass contamination and removal of the heat shrinkage stage during vacuum packaging as this activates the spores and reduces the time to spoilage.&quot;</p><p>  The report provides guidance to industry on minimising the risk of this problem.  The research, which was funded by my Department and carried out by Teagasc, discovered a new Blown Pack Spoilage Clostridia species (<i>C. ruminantium</i>); delivered key data and demonstrated the detrimental effect of vacuum packaging heat shrinkage in spore activation.  As a result of this work,<i></i>Teagasc's food research centre in Ashtown, Co. Dublin developed a PCR assay to detect the problem and is now offering a testing service to the meat industry and other food industries.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is about to fund a new research project which will include an investigation of issues associated with <i>C. estertheticum </i>and to develop and validate a rapid real time PCR assay capable of detecting and enumerating <i>C. estertheticum,</i><i>C. gasigenes</i> and <i>C. ruminantium</i> .</p></reply>

The scheme was initially Exchequer funded under a pilot scheme from 2007-2009 and has been co-funded by the EU under the Rural Development Programme since 2010.  My Department has no role in relation to commercial arrangements between individual farmers and contractors for the end use of their energy crops.  The pricing of product is also a commercial matter.</p><p>  In February 2012, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, T.D., introduced REFIT supports for bioenergy, including tariffs to support Biomass Combined Heat and Power and Biomass Combustion.  These tariffs are designed to provide financial incentives for the end use of energy crops, including miscanthus.  In December 2011, I amended the terms and conditions of the Bioenergy Scheme so as to remove the obligation on growers to maintain the crop for seven years as a condition of retaining grant-aid.  This afforded an opportunity for growers who wished to exit the scheme to do so without penalty and was available to all growers including those who had established crops since the commencement of the scheme in 2007.</p></reply>

The initiative is expected to receive funding of &euro;14 million to provide, in a full year, in the region of 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school, in order to support parents to take up employment.  </p><p>  Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of these opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment.  Preparations are well advanced for the introduction of a pilot project in a small number of locations with the national roll-out of the programme planned for September this year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme. Service providers seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner. </p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot phase of the programme will be evaluated to establish if the programme meets this objective and, if necessary, to identify areas where corrective action is required.</p></reply>

Childcare services participating in the ECCE programme are paid a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child enrolled for the free pre-school year.  Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs), for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate, the pre-school leader must hold a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full Level 7 award on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and meet other conditions as set out by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  A joint  inspection pilot conducted by the HSE  Inspectorate and the Department of Education and Skills was recently completed.

I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.</p><p>  The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years and a  National Implementation Group has been established   to oversee the progress and challenges in improving services and outcomes for young people leaving care.  The Group is comprised of representatives of funded services providers such as Focus Ireland and other advocacy organisations, as well as representatives of foster carers and other groups.  They have found  an  increasingly systematic approach across the country  to young people around age sixteen being identified through the care planning review process and a standardised aftercare planning template. This approach is helping the early identification of young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, and has led to good examples of inter-agency working. There have also been some improvements in the data available although more work is required in this area and in rolling out fully standardised financial allowances.</p><p>  The HSE's annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million. There are currently 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE; additionally, the HSE commissions aftercare services, residential and support in the community, from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care across the country.  The HSE have advised me that approximately 500 young people reach the age of 18 in care every year, with 412 young people in care reaching their 18th birthday in 2012.</p><p>  At the end of December 2012:</p><p>  - 639 young people over the age of 18 years were supported financially to remain living with their foster carers. These young people did not have to face the transition of leaving their foster carers at age 18 and for many, in addition to having access to an after care worker,  they received their key support from their foster carers.</p><p>  - 110 young people were living in supported living arrangements and had an aftercare key worker.</p><p>  - there were 384 young people over 21 receiving some aspect of aftercare support; the remaining 1073 were between 18 and 21.</p><p> -  599 of the total number  were in full time education.</p><p> - a further 656 were in some form of education and training.</p><p>  Given the particular difficulties of some young people in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.  The Aftercare Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care and the Department of the Environment regarding housing to support this approach.  A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. </p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of an aftercare service but more work remains to be done.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people and the information provided will inform the policy development being undertaken to underpin aftercare in legislation.</p></reply>

Any alternative route to membership of the College must be approved by the ICGP and must be of equivalent standard to the conventional route to membership, i.e. formal training undertaken in an accredited GP training programme and completion of end point assessment - the MICGP examination.</p><p>  In March 2009, the College sought a declaration of interest in order to gauge the level of interest in the alternative route to membership.  In the interim, consideration needed to be given to the criteria for eligibility, possible models of assessment and the budgetary and funding implications.  In February 2012, an online pre-application questionnaire was carried out to determine the number of potential applicants who may be eligible.  173 applicants responded, 135 approx. of whom are likely to meet the criteria and also meet the requirements in order to engage in the assessment process.  A programme director was formally appointed for this project in May 2012 and work is underway to set up the structures and processes required to implement the alternative route.  The various assessment components are being prepared for pilot at present.  The College will open the process for the taking of applications from 23 April 23, 2013.</p><p>  The eligibility criteria for application for this route to membership have been agreed by the ICGP Postgraduate Training Committee and this was endorsed by the Council of the College in March 2011.

Of its nature, selection criteria may exclude some applicants.  It is impossible to comment on an individual doctor's eligibility for participation in the Alternative Route Programme until they formally apply and supply the necessary details to the programme team for assessment.

This event provides a forum for wider public consultation and discussion on social inclusion issues, in particular for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and the groups that work with them.  The forum has ensured that such stakeholders have a voice in the development of the policies that directly affect them, and how they are implemented.  The Social Inclusion Forum is convened by the Department of Social Protection.  In relation to disability funding, this Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2013, and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.  In 2013 the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012,  by providing the following specialist disability services:	residential services to over 9,000 people with a disability; day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; respite residential support for over 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.  The Government and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant services available to persons with disabilities.  In the 2013 National Service Plan (NSP), the HSE's priority is to maximise the provision of services to people with disabilities within available resources and to maintain a consistent level to that provided for in 2012, including the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.</p><p>  The demand for life-skills training and day services for school-leavers with disabilities continues to grow.  The HSE expects that approximately 700 school-leavers will require services in 2013.  I am pleased to confirm that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4 million to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on the percentage of population.  The recommendations of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services (New Directions) will guide the reconfiguration and modernisation of HSE funded adult day services and will underpin the collaborative action in terms of flexibility and innovation when addressing requirements for school leavers in 2013.  Currently the National Disability Unit is liaising with the Regional Leads for Disability Services in terms of a cohesive and collaborative approach to meeting the needs of school leavers within the resources available.  Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of this funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible.</p></reply>

The end point is that countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies preferably by the end of 2013.  In 2011, I established a Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the Council Recommendation on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Since that time work has been progressing steadily on the development of the Plan.  This has included a Consultation Event with stakeholders in Farmleigh last June followed by an on-line consultation.  Work on the drafting of the plan is well underway and it is my intention to publish the Plan by the end of this year.</p></reply>

I do accept that there is a need for the use of sunbeds to be restricted, especially for children, because of the increased risk of skin cancer and other health problems.  The Government has approved the drafting of legislation in this regard.  This legislation will prohibit the use of sunbeds on a sunbed premises by persons under 18 years of age and will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include: (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises; (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age; (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises; (iv) an exemption for medical purposes; (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE; (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear to users; (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises; (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices; (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the drafting of this legislation.  It is important to bear in mind that the Bill, when finalised, must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive <i>prior</i> to the publication and introduction of the Bill in the Oireachtas.  This EU notification requirement will necessitate a minimum of three months to complete.</p></reply>

Mental health social workers carry out a range of functions as members of multidisciplinary Community Mental Health Teams.  Case management involves the integration of health services with a range of other services including, housing, social welfare, job training and employment, liaison with statutory and voluntary agencies etc.  The National Service User Executive also has a role in assisting service users along with other agencies such as Citizens Information services which provides an Advocacy service to persons with a disability, to support those people in accessing their entitlements such as rent allowances etc.  In addition, individuals, while in-patients in acute mental health units, have access to a Peer Advocate who will provide information and support.</p><p>  The Department of Health's statutory role is to support the Minister for Health in the formulation and evaluation of policies for the health services.  It also has a role in the strategic planning of health services.  This is carried out in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, voluntary service providers, Government Departments and other interested parties.

One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Regulations regarding fluoridation of public water supplies to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm.  Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.  The fluoride currently used is sourced as a primary product; it is mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar as calcium fluoride (CaF2).  It then goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluorosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.</p><p>  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.</p></reply>

The HSE also recognise the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes and communities in accordance with Government policy. Home helps play a vital role in enabling people to continue to live at home and this policy will continue to be a key feature of health service delivery. The Government will make every effort, despite significant resource pressures, to protect front-line home support services for vulnerable older people and to facilitate the development of the home help service.</p><p>  While the HSE announced a reduction in the provision of home help hours as one of a number of measures required to address the significant 2012 budget deficit last October, this was subject to home help services continuing to be available to those assessed as requiring them. The HSE&rsquo;s 2013 Service Plan includes the provision of 10.3 million hours of home help service, the same level as planned for in 2012.</p><p>  The number of hours worked by home help assistants varies according to service needs. Their terms and conditions were covered by an agreement negotiated with the representative unions in 2009.  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning the contracts of home help assistants.  The Court issued a further recommendation on 12 December 2012 noting that management proposals to deal with the issues raised would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services. The parties have since met on a number of occasions in relation to contractual issues under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and this engagement is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides support to individuals, not to nursing homes. In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  The NTPF assesses nursing home process under four criteria:</p><p>  -	costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p><p>  -	price(s) previously charged,</p><p>  -	local market price, and</p><p>  -	Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>  An NTPF pricing agreement is in place with the nursing home referred to by the Deputy.  It is scheduled for renewal on 1 July 2013 and NTPF are currently in contact with the proprietors concerning that renewal.</p></reply>

The HSE National Service Plan 2013 commits to a number of objectives including the further development of suicide prevention initiatives and forensic services; community mental health teams for adults, children and older persons and for mental health intellectual disability; and to the recruitment of 477 additional staff to implement these measures.  </p><p>  In order to ensure that the additional resources will be used to best effect, the HSE, in consultation with the Department of Health, is working towards finalising the allocation of these resources.  Business cases from each HSE Region are being finalised and examined, against each of the identified objectives, detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  It is expected that this process will be concluded in the very near future with a view to recruitment of the additional staff proceeding as soon as possible. 384 of the 414 posts approved in 2012 have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  I have been assured by the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013 and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012 is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention recognises the youth sector as a high risk group and sets out a number of specific actions.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   </p><p>  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &euro;13 million.  Over &euro;8 million of this is provided to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.  This includes an additional &euro;1 million from the &euro;35 million allocation for 2013 (above).  The remaining &euro;5 million for suicide prevention is available regionally to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.</p><p>The NOSP is reviewing its current activities to make the  most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  This will result in a revised strategic approach for 2013 and will inform the final phase of <i>Reach Out,</i>  our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention which runs until 2014.  I expect that the HSE will approve the revised approach in the very near future.</p><p>  This reviewed approach will build on progress made to date, which includes the provision of awareness and training programmes such as safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), National Mental Health Awareness Campaigns as well as the Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health &amp;amp; Suicide Prevention which were jointly developed with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005-2011, charges apply for in-patient services other than for acute hospital care and for long-term residential care services supported under the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Fair Deal), both of which are subject to separate charging regimes. Under these Regulations, the HSE must apply charges (subject to certain exemptions) to all those who receive in-patient services for longer than 30 days over a rolling 12 month period. <b></b>Charges apply whether or not the person has full or limited eligibility. </p><p>  I understand that directions to ensure the uniform application of the existing legislation on charges for in-patient respite care services across all HSE areas were circulated by the HSE at the end of March 2013 for implementation with immediate effect. This development brought areas that were not charging for in-patient respite care services into line with other areas that were already charging for such services. As a result, and in the interests of fairness and equity, in-patient respite care charges have now been implemented in all areas on a standard and consistent basis in  accordance with the legislation in place since 2005.</p><p>  The level of the charges is based on income and cannot exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension. The Regulations currently provide for a maximum charge of &euro;175 per week where in-patient care is provided in a setting with 24-hour nursing care or a maximum of &euro;130 per week where in-patient care is provided in other settings.  The charging legislation provides that the HSE may reduce or waive charges where necessary to avoid financial hardship, having regard to individual financial circumstances (including whether there are dependants).</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.   Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

The current Programme for Government includes a specific commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.

The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is not a static service. The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.</p><p>  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has been addressing response times through a number of measures, including:</p><p>- the Performance Improvement Action Plan, focussing on local issues such as call taking and dispatch, faster crew mobilisation and community first responder schemes;</p><p>- the intermediate care service (ICS), for non-emergency ambulance transport, such as inter-hospital transfers, freeing emergency vehicles for emergency calls:  nearly 40 ICS staff were appointed last year, with further resources to be deployed in 2013;</p><p>- the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), which reduces transit times, particularly in the West, and allows emergency vehicles to remain within their regions;</p><p>- the national control centre reconfiguration, with one national control system on two sites - Tallaght and Ballyshannon - for improved dispatch and response times, with regional, rather than local, deployment and better use of first responder schemes.</p><p>  These measures, together with more effective use of existing resources, for example with improved training and better deployment through more efficient rostering,  will drive the improvement of response times in every region.  This will lead to better services and better outcomes when our citizens need these services.</p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy regarding the proposal  to invest &euro;12m in the ambulance service in 2013,  as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Last December, the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i>   case.  Intensive work is underway in my Department on drafting this legislation and it is the Government's intention that the Heads of a Bill will be published in April.</p></reply>

Beechpark is a regional HSE service which provides clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder up to 18 years of age who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The service has to operate within the financial and other parameters applying.</p><p>  Importantly, the Beechpark service is working with local implementation groups to progress disability services for children and young people across the HSE's Dublin north-east and Dublin-mid-Leinster areas.  They are focussing on the current service model and service delivery structure provided by all service providers in the area, with a view to addressing the realignment of resources in the context of the report of the national reference group, the national review of autism services report and the progressing disability services programme.  This issue is also being examined by the independent Dublin Beechpark service review group.</p><p>  While the current economic position presents challenges in how best to maximise the provision of services with available resources, I am committed to protecting front-line services, including children's disability and autism services to the greatest extent possible.  In that context, I have raised my concerns with the HSE regarding staff rotation and the impact of the public sector recruitment moratorium on front-line staff, especially therapists.  I will also continue to work closely with the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to address this matter. </p></reply>

This will of course require detailed consideration and further consultation and I am developing proposals for Government on this matter.</p><p>  In addition to consent systems, there is evidence from other countries that good co-ordination at hospital level and counselling arrangements for relatives are significant factors in achieving high organ donation rates.  In conjunction with the HSE's National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office I am also examining what practices and organisational  changes could further improve donation rates in this country. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that following discussions between my Department and the Road Safety Authority, the new Driving Licence Application Form contains a question asking applicants if they would like a code to be placed on their driving licence indicating their wish to become an organ donor.  Since the introduction of a new type of driving licence on 19 January, the code that will appear on new driving licences issued to people who indicate that they wish to become an organ donor, is 115.  My Department has written to the National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office and the Regional Directors of Operations in the HSE asking them to alert relevant hospital staff to this initiative and to the code which will appear on new driving licences of people who wish to donate.  My Department is also in discussion with the Department of Social Protection with a view to including a similar code on the Public Services Card.  </p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Therefore, it is inaccurate to suggest that termination will be permitted in cases where there are mental health risks - rather it will only be permitted where it is established by expert medical opinion that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i> case.  The aim of the Bill is to bring clarity and certainty in relation to the process for the determination of whether a termination of pregnancy is permissible on the basis that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman as a result of that pregnancy.</p></reply>

While my immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the twelve professions currently designated under the Act, I am committed to bringing counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work done by a number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups in coming together as the Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice in so far as is possible.  There are a number of issues still to be clarified, however.  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession.  The QQI Report is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2014.  In addition, the standards of proficiency to be required of existing practitioners for registration will need to be established and the necessary qualifications prescribed.</p><p>  Officials of my Department will be engaging with the Psychological Therapies Forum and other relevant stakeholders as soon as the QQI report is available. They will work through the outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed with a view to achieving regulation of the profession as soon as possible in the best interests of the protection of the public.  I would like to emphasise that while counsellors and psychotherapists are not currently subject to professional statutory regulation, they are of course subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.</p></reply>

This represents a total 2013 allocation of RTP funding of &euro;189,322 for the provision of RTP services in the County Roscommon area.  </p><p>  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making  the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  Addressing rural isolation is a key component of the Rural Transport Programme.  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   </p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding the County Roscommon area or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>

The increased funding for the RTP has led to increases in the level of services provided rising from 40,000 services in 2003 to 217,686 services in 2012.  The number of passenger journeys recorded on those services also increased from 151,000 in 2003 to 1.73 million in 2012.</p><p>  Since 1<sup>st</sup> April 2012 the National Authority (NTA has been managing the Programme with Pobal administering it on the NTA's behalf.</p><p><b>  Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP</b></p><p>- The RTP was selected for a Value for Money and Policy Review in line with a commitment given at the launch of the Programme in 2007.  The Review covered the period 2002 to 2009.</p><p>- Key findings of the Review include:</p><p>- Concerns over the value for money in the context of a rate of increase in Programme funding without an accompanying equivalent increase in passenger numbers or services </p><p>- The current organisational structure for delivery (35 RTP groups) is a key factor in the lack of cost efficiencies being achieved both in administration and operations</p><p>- The cost of administration has been and remains very high as a proportion of total RTP group expenditure (22% in 2009)</p><p>- Substantial increases in operating costs - between 2007 and 2009 wages and salaries doubled as a consequence of increased staffing and salary levels</p><p>- Lack of data to measure the benefits of the Programme in terms of addressing social inclusion objectives and data gaps in the framework of performance monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>  The Review made a number of recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Programme.  The NTA was tasked with implementing the findings of the Review.</p><p>  The main recommendations of the report are:</p><p>  - Reduce overall Programme costs particularly the administration costs</p><p>  - Improve efficiency of the Programm</p><p>  - Address the status of the Programme within the context of public transport regulation in Ireland</p><p>  - Develop a detailed appraisal plan for an organisational restructuring to achieve greater programme efficiencies</p><p>  - Better alignment to be established between the voluntary county-based RTP groups involved and the Local Authorities</p><p>  Administration costs to the Programme were reduced by 33.5 % by end 2012.  Combined with the reduction in Pobal's costs, the threshold administration proportion of 17% recommended in the VfM Review was also achieved by end 2012.  In order to achieve the recommended administration costs of 13%, the proposed restructuring of the RTP is required.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.</p><p>  The RTP budget for 2014 - 2015 will be determined as part of the estimates and budgetary process for these years.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  </p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   </p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.   </p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding the County Donegal area or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   </p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>
