The Bank also plans to assess on a regular basis the need for contingency-based extra Brexit-related hiring in response to additional business volumes.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Governor has previously indicated to me that where further resources are necessary due to an expanded universe of regulated and supervised firms, the Bank has the ability to effectively re-prioritise where it needs to meet the increased level of demand and also to increase staff numbers as necessary. </p>  <p>  That independent commitment by the Central Bank to address the opportunities and challenges posed by Brexit will be articulated in the IFS 2020 Action Plan which is to be published shortly underscoring the commitment of the Central Bank to providing a high quality, fair and transparent authorisation process for all applicants.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Central Bank is resourced to meet the current level of demand and enquiries that are being presented and that the Bank has the ability to effectively re-prioritise in the short-term where necessary to meet any increased level of demand and complexity.  The Central Bank has the capacity to confront any challenges posed by Brexit and it has the resources to deal with any upsurge in applications that may come its way.</p></reply>

These are frictional vacancies, for example relating to units between tenancies, the number of which will fluctuate over time.</p>  <p>  NAMA's 2016 year end review, available on the NAMA website, highlights NAMA's progress to date, in facilitating the delivery of social and private housing.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy is aware, NAMA does not own property.  NAMA owns loans.  As a lender, NAMA cannot force a borrower to take action which would reduce his/her repayment capacity, such as providing a property for social or private housing where that is not economically optimal.  To do so would compromise a borrower's capacity to repay his or her debts to NAMA and would constitute a direct breach of the borrower's property rights, protected under Article 43 of the Constitution.  I am advised that a direction running counter to these obligations is not one lawfully open to me in all the current circumstances. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-17a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017011700062#WRA01800"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the 'Help to Buy' incentive was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness'.  This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current housing crisis, of which the Help to Buy incentive is one.  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy scheme should be considered.  Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the Help-to-Buy incentive on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property prices on an ongoing basis.  However, the Help to Buy incentive, which came into effect at the start of this month, has been introduced for two reasons - to assist first time buyers in putting together the requisite deposit to buy a home, and to encourage the construction of new homes.  As such, I am not willing to suspend the Help to Buy incentive so soon after implementing it as this would not create the conditions to encourage the construction of new homes.</p>  <p>  I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the Help to Buy incentive which will look at, among other issues, the impact on property prices.  However, it should be remembered that the high rates of house price increases reflect the supply constrained nature of the Irish residential market, and were an issue over the past number of years rather than since the start of the Help to Buy incentive.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  It introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm' and such firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the CCMA) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016.  The CCMA already provides protections to borrowers in difficulties.  Lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of the borrower's primary residence after it follows a number of steps.  The steps include:</p>  <p>  - Making every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative restructure arrangement (ARA) with the borrower;</p>  <p>  - time bound requirements to inform the borrower the regulated entity is not willing to offer an ARA and of his/her options;</p>  <p>  - time bound requirements to inform a borrower, who is not willing to enter into an ARA, of his/her options; and</p>  <p>  - a decision to classify the borrower as non-cooperating.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that there is a broad range of available restructures offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities and there is strong evidence that both banks and non-banks look to exhaust available restructure options before moving to the legal process.</p>  <p>  I expect that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.  My Department will also keep the situation under review to ensure that protections stay in place and that there are no gaps in protection.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-17a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017011700062#WRA02600"><p>Ireland's national debt levels and dependence on international support at the time of the crisis, prohibited the State from directly investing in the distressed assets resulting from the crisis.  Exposure to the banks, IBRC and NAMA each became exposures of the taxpayer net liabilities - that had to be reduced for the State to regain financial stability.</p>  <p>  Interest from the capital markets led to much needed capital investment in our economy during periods of high risk and uncertainty.  This investment allowed us to make important financial adjustments across our system, in particular deleveraging and addressing liquidity concerns of our financial services system, which includes the individual bank asset sales programmes, now largely complete, the liquidation of IBRC and the ongoing disposal of NAMA's assets.  Without this investment Ireland would be experiencing a much more difficult recovery.  Similarly, Ireland would not be recovering so strongly had NAMA not progressed its mandate in the manner it has.  It has only been through the sale of these assets and the accompanying investment that these assets have recovered and are contributing to our broader recovery. </p>  <p>   The timely sale and the accompanying investment in these assets is making a strong contribution towards our broader recovery.  Think of the numerous renovated hotels, finished housing estates, commercial property developments, ongoing residential developments and the commerce and jobs this creates.  All of this is a direct result of investment in Ireland, much of it by the acquirers of these loans.</p>  <p>  A key objective in each of these deleveraging processes has been to achieve the best possible financial return for the State.  With asset disposal processes occurring and set to continue in both Ireland and across Europe, Irish institutions have and will continue to face competition for investment capital as they seek to achieve the best possible financial return.

Equally NAMA cannot impose conditions on a buyer of its loans nor on the owner of the underlying property following a loan sale.</p>  <p>  Rather than demonising certain lenders or landlords, we must ensure that an appropriate level of protections, obligations and responsibilities apply consistently for all tenants and all landlords. </p>  <p>  Landlord-tenant rights are governed by multiple pieces of legislation, mainly under the aegis of the Minister for the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  This legislation attempts to balance and protect the rights of the tenant and the landlord and sets out the specific limited circumstances under which landlords are able to seek vacant possession of properties.  These restrictions apply to all landlords regardless of who owns their loans. </p>  <p>  Under Pillar 4 of Rebuilding Ireland, an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act was brought through the Oireachtas in December 2016 as part of the Government's rental strategy.  The effect of the provision is to require that tenancies are protected where a landlord or investor wishes to sell more than 10 properties in a single development.  </p>  <p>  I note that, on Friday 13th January, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government confirmed that the owners of the apartments referenced in the question are writing to the effected tenants to withdraw the previously issued termination notices and to confirm that they will abide by the spirit of the amendment to Section 35A of the Residential Tenancies Act which is expected to come into effect this week.  </p>  <p>  The decision by the owners comes after contact from Minister Coveney in which he asked that the spirit of the amendment to Section 35A would be respected, in advance of into coming into effect, to ensure that the existing tenancies are unaffected by a transfer of ownership.  The owners replied formally to the Minister to confirm that it would respect the change and that it would be writing to tenants to confirm withdrawal of the original notices.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy, and residents of the complex, will welcome this announcement given there was no legal requirement for the property owners to take this approach.  I commend the owners for respecting the will of the Government and the Oireachtas.  This shows the value already of some of the measures contained in the Government's strategy for the rental sector and the importance of a partnership approach by all players; tenants, landlords, housing providers, local and national Government.</p>  <p>  These measures are accompanied by a number of other actions to enhance the Residential Tenancies Board's enforcement and dispute resolution powers.  These include faster processing of determination orders, the reduction in period for appeal to Tribunals, and the use of one person Tribunals.  Tenants and landlords alike will therefore see a number of improvements as a result of these legislative changes. </p>  <p>  Any tenant who believes that their legal rights are being compromised should bring their concerns to the Residential Tenancies Board which has the power to ensure their rights are upheld.  This includes cases where a tenant believes that a termination notice has not been properly served.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that there has been no change in policy in relation to this matter and the position adopted by Revenue is in accordance with long established taxation principles.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that Revenue has committed to facilitate the appeals process should a taxpayer raise an appeal to the independent Tax Appeal Commission in relation to a tax assessment relating to the patronage share issue.</p>  <p>  In relation to share based remuneration schemes, in general, employees are subject to income tax on share issues where the employer issues such shares and charges the employee less than the market value for them. Income tax is due on the difference in the relevant values and is generally collected via the PAYE system, while income tax due on share options must be returned within 30 days of the exercise of such options. In certain cases the relevant shares may be subject to a clog, restricting the employee from selling such shares for a set period of time.  However, notwithstanding this restriction on sale, any income tax due is payable at the time of the share award.</p>  <p>  A more favourable treatment may apply under certain Revenue Approved share schemes, but such schemes are subject to a range of restrictions, and are used primarily by larger, quoted companies.  Deputies will be aware that I announced my intention to introduce a new, SME focussed share-based remuneration incentive in Budget 2018.  This is a complex undertaking, as a focussed scheme of this nature will need to comply with State Aid regulations, and it is likely to require EU approval.</p>  <p>  Therefore, in the years in which the patronage scheme was active, employees who received share based remuneration in an SME company would in most cases have been subject to income tax on any value received.  As such, there would not appear to be a policy rationale to legislate for different treatment specifically for patronage shares in those years.  Furthermore, an amendment of the nature proposed by the Deputy would be retrospective, in that it would change the tax treatment of transactions occurring in the years 2011 to 2013.  Retrospective changes undermine the certainty of the tax system for all taxpayers and can be subject to Constitutional challenge in the courts, and would not be appropriate in this instance.</p></reply>

Such calculations are normally completed where a change of policy is being brought forward by Government and the associated estimated cost or yield is calculated in order to inform the Oireachtas in relation to the impact on the Exchequer of such a policy change.  Such costings help to inform the associated debates in these houses.  In this case however, the position is that the Revenue Commissioners are interpreting and implementing tax law as it stands and there has been no departure from existing policy and interpretation.</p>  <p>  Depending on the particular circumstances and incomes of each taxpayer involved, the setting out of this tax treatment by the Revenue Commissioners could result in additional taxes being due, or indeed in a reduced tax burden for some.  Calculation of a tax yield impact analysis in such a scenario, would be difficult and as outlined previously, unwarranted given the position of the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no change in practice on their part in terms of the appropriate tax treatment of such income.</p></reply>

This is, of course, in addition to our regular contacts at monthly meetings of EU Finance Ministers at ECOFIN.</p>  <p>  Chancellor Hammond and I engaged constructively on the very strong relationship between Ireland and the U.K, the importance of trade between the two economies, and on the many areas of common interest shared by our two countries.  I reiterated that the Irish Government's headline priorities concerning Brexit remain the economy, Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and the future of the EU itself. </p>  <p>  In line with the agreement at EU level, there have been and will be no negotiations with the UK until Article 50 has been triggered.  Chancellor Hammond is aware that Ireland remains a committed EU Member State and will be part of the EU 27 team both for the preparations and for the forthcoming negotiations.  We want negotiations to be constructive and believe that a close and positive future relationship between the UK and the EU post-departure is of benefit to us all.  Chancellor Hammond also confirmed that the unique relationship between Ireland and the UK has never been more important or as complex and that Prime Minister May has made clear that she is personally committed to building on the strengths of this relationship.  Trade between our two countries benefits each nation enormously and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, so it is in everyone's interest to build upon our strong ties.</p>  <p>  I underlined that it is important for the British Government to set out its Brexit negotiation objectives as soon as possible.  This will contribute to ensuring that the forthcoming negotiations are conducted in an organised and constructive way, leading to an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. </p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing my discussions with Chancellor Hammond in the context of our Government's ongoing preparations for Brexit. </p></reply>

It would also be unfair to taxpayers in the event that they ended up paying more to the Exchequer than actually required by the law.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners, as I have said already, are a statutorily independent body, charged with collecting the taxes lawfully owing to the Exchequer, and they do so in accordance with the legislation enacted by these Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  The deployment of Revenue resources is a matter entirely for Revenue.  I would again reiterate that I have been advised by Revenue that the position being adopted by Revenue is in accordance with long established taxation principles that consideration received which is directly related to produce sold, whether in the form of cash or shares, is subject to taxation as income.  In this case, the Revenue Commissioners are interpreting and implementing tax law as it stands and they have assured me that there has been no departure from existing policy and interpretation.</p>  <p>  Where there are different views as to the correct tax treatment of any particular item or transaction an appeal may be made to the Tax Appeal Commission where the matter will be adjudicated on, in the first instance, by a Tax Appeal Commissioner.  Where the issue relates to a point of law the matter can be further appealed, by either party, to the superior courts.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that officials of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 7 December last, and engaged fully with the questions of members of both this house and the Seanad on this issue.  I understand that, during that appearance, Revenue committed to facilitate the appeals process should a taxpayer raise an appeal to the independent Tax Appeal Commission.  Furthermore, Revenue also confirmed that there would be no action by Revenue in the interim period to seek to collect the tax liability in the assessment raised by Revenue while appeal processes are underway.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is incumbent on this House to allow these legal due processes to take place in accordance with the law.</p></reply>

This was effected through the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  The significant point is that we regulated at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016.  It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract. </p>  <p>  In addition, to further enhance the protection of borrowers, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  The legislation also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit servicing firm to perform such an action.  Therefore the borrower is protected because the owner cannot give an instruction that would breach the rules but also the instruction cannot be implemented by the regulated credit servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expect that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  In relation to tenants, landlord-tenant relations are governed by multiple pieces of legislation (mainly under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government).  The landlord/owner of the property is restricted in what they can do in relation to removal of tenants from a property.  These restrictions are the same whether the landlord bought the property, built the property themselves, became a landlord as a result of renting out what was formerly a principal dwelling house or acquired the property by other means such as enforcing loans secured on the property.</p></reply>

The Examination is a key priority for the Central Bank and it continues to challenge lenders to ensure that progress is being made and fair outcomes are being achieved for customers.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that while the Bank cannot comment on the specific details of the ongoing tracker mortgage examination or any enforcement investigations relating to this matter, in November 2016, it issued a reprimand and imposed a fine of &euro;4.5m on Springboard Mortgages Limited in respect of serious failings in its obligations to tracker mortgage customer.  The Central Bank has statutory reporting obligations to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and other agencies, where it suspects a criminal offence may have been committed by a supervised entity.  The Central Bank takes these obligations very seriously and complies with them on an on-going basis as appropriate.</p></reply>

Rental profits of companies are subject to Corporation Tax at 25%.  Rental profits arising in a REIT are exempt from Corporation Tax.  However, profits from any other activities are subject to Corporation Tax in the normal way.</p>  <p>  As such, the estimated cost attached to the REIT relates not to an exemption from tax, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income to the taxation of dividends distributed from REIT profits arising from that rental income.  The extent of any net tax cost of the REIT exemptions will therefore be the difference between the tax which would have arisen on the property income in non-REIT ownership, and the tax charged on the dividends paid out of that property income by the REIT to their investors.  The REIT legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.  </p>  <p>  Any potential loss of tax relating to foreign investors is due to the difference between how company dividends are taxed in the hands of foreign investors compared to how profits from direct ownership of property are taxed.  In order to ensure that Ireland retained taxing rights over property, dividend withholding tax on distributions from REIT to foreign investors was specifically legislated for.  In the absence of any other provisions, foreign REIT shareholders would not have had any liability to Irish tax on REIT dividends, despite the fact that the REIT itself benefits from a tax exemption on qualifying profits of the rental business.  Foreign investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.  The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that state.</p></reply>

Revenue's work in relation to offshore accounts and other financial product investigations has to date resulted in the recovery of &euro;2.8 billion in tax, interest and penalties.</p>  <p>  In line with their active approach to identifying and confronting those who try to escape their tax responsibilities, Revenue  has advised me also they are examining the information that has become available through the "Panama Papers" revelations, and, in addition, that they have requested access to any elements of that documentation that could be of relevance to their work against tax evasion and avoidance.  They are committed to making the fullest possible use of any available information in pursuing cases where it appears that tax liabilities have not been addressed. </p>  <p>  Revenue continues  to engage fully with the OECD Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) Network to agree concrete actions that tax administrations can take in response to evidence of tax avoidance and evasion, and leading to a multilateral and coordinated approach to the "Panama Papers" data.  Effective cooperation of this kind between countries is essential in tackling this worldwide problem, if the international community is to succeed in ensuring that there will be no hiding places for those who seek to escape their tax obligations.</p>  <p>  I fully support the widespread move towards increased global financial and tax transparency, and Revenue is at the forefront of international developments for Automatic Exchange of Information.  Key developments in this field are the OECD's Common Reporting Standard, the EU's Directives on Administrative Cooperation and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Initiative.  Revenue has advised me that they are considering carefully how to make the best possible use of all data sources of this kind to identify any cases of tax evasion by Irish residents using offshore accounts or structures.</p>  <p>   I am committed to supporting any legislative changes that are needed to tackle tax evasion using offshore structures or accounts and have, for that reason, included in Finance Act 2016 a measure that, as and from 1 May 2017, eliminates any possibility of a qualifying disclosure in cases of that kind.  Anybody who has tax liabilities relating to offshore matters and who does not act now to address them will face the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible prosecution.</p></reply>

Similarly, the demand by mortgage providers for flood insurance as an element of home insurance is also a commercial matter.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into its assessment of flood risk within these areas.  This information has been provided as part of an information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding).  The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas, and at better prices. </p>  <p>  The most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the 16 completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 77% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover.  The particular issues in relation to the remainder of policies is actively being explored with the insurance industry through a working group in which the OPW, the insurance industry and the Department of Finance participate.  Further meetings of this group are scheduled this month.</p>  <p>  Following a meeting last July between Minister of State Canney and Insurance Ireland it was agreed that information and data on the deployment protocols, warning systems and emergency response systems in place where demountable defences are utilised would be provided to industry.  The purpose of this information is to enable the industry reassess the overall level of risk with demountable flood defences in this context.  It is hoped that this data will provide the robust information required for industry to reduce the risk it has associated with demountable defences and increase the levels of cover for these areas.  This is subject to ongoing discussions.</p></reply>

This data does not provide numbers of loans or breakdown by type of loan.  My officials are currently liaising with the Central Bank to assess what level of data can be recorded in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, enacted on 8 July 2015, was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Act, therefore, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract. </p>  <p>  Also, following a review in 2015, the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises, has been strengthened in certain areas resulting in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016 for regulated lenders (other than credit unions) and, in the case of credit unions, on 1 January 2017. </p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office. </p><p>The Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau was established under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, 2004.

The Financial Services Ombudsman was set up to adjudicate on unresolved disputes between complainants and financial service providers.  </p><p>The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 also provided for the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council.  One of the statutory functions of the Council is to keep under review the efficiency and effectiveness of the Bureau and advises the Minister for Finance, either at my request or on its own initiative, on any matter relevant to the operation of the Bureau. </p><p>I can confirm that I have not requested any reviews in relation to the performance of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  However, the Deputy will be aware that legislation to amalgamate the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman is currently before the House. </p><p>In advance of the amalgamation of the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau (FSOB) and Office of the Pensions Ombudsman (OPO), the need to complete a review of the organisations was identified and agreed by both Ombudsmen and the Financial Services Ombudsman Council.  Bearing Point undertook a detailed analysis of the operations of the Financial Services Ombudsman and Office of the Pensions Ombudsman in terms of their processes, strategies and objectives.  Details of the Strategic and Operational Review are available on the Financial Services Ombudsman's website at <i> .  </i></p><p>Section 57BD of the 2004 Act states that one of the functions of the Council is to appoint the Financial Services Ombudsman and each Deputy Financial Services Ombudsman so his or her expertise is a matter for the Council to ascertain.

This has been a contributory factor in the past to these cycles.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a key issue identified by the Working Group related to a lack of clarity, certainty and transparency of motor insurance costs.  Greater transparency through the creation of a national claims information database will enable the identification of these trends and should facilitate appropriate policy responses in order to help avoid these cycles in the future.</p>  <p>  Finally, with the publication of this report and the successful implementation of its recommendations, fairer premiums can be delivered which will lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and will help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past that has led to these cycles.  This will assist in putting to an end the sort of cycles that we have witnessed in recent years.</p></reply>

NAMA has facilitated the sale or lease by its debtors and receivers of properties, on commercial terms, to public bodies for a wide-range of purposes, including social housing; schools; healthcare facilities; and urban economic, environmental and cultural regeneration.  All such transactions are executed at market value. </p>  <p>  However, NAMA can only identify these potentially suitable properties and, ultimately, it is a matter for local authorities to determine which properties are most suitable for their housing needs.  This process has seen the delivery of almost 2,400 units to local authorities, with a further 370 in the delivery pipeline.</p>  <p>  NAMA also plans to facilitate the delivery of up to 20,000 private residential units to end 2020, assuming commercial viability. </p>  <p>  I would refer the Deputy to NAMA's 2016 Year End review which highlights the significant achievements in delivery of social and private housing as well as many other key performance metrics.</p>  <p>  I recognise the urgency of the issues you are seeking to address and believe NAMA does play a part in addressing these issues in line with its mandate.  I believe the NAMA Board has appropriately balanced and is effectively carrying out its mandate, including a significant social and economic contribution.</p></reply>

The Central Bank also consulted me, pursuant to section 49 of the Central Bank (Supervision &amp;amp; Enforcement) Act 2013, on the draft regulations which set out the proposed changes to the lending rules following the outcome of its review.  These regulations have now been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>These new regulations make certain refinements to the mortgage lending rules which were initially introduced in February 2015.  In relation to first time buyers of a principal dwelling home, such buyers are now required to provide a minimum deposit of 10 per cent of the entire value of the property, with the loan-to-value (LTV) ceiling set at 90 per cent.  This replaces the previous situation whereby a deposit of 10 per cent was required on the first &euro;220,000 of the price of a property and 20 per cent on any balance above &euro;220,000.  The Central Bank has indicated that this change was made because the previous system was complex and would require regular updating and also that there was evidence showing that first-time buyers defaulted less than second-time and subsequent buyers, with the differential in default probabilities especially strong in the case of lower-valued properties.  In addition, the Central Bank made some changes to proportionate LTV allowances regime and in relation to first time buyers they now provide that up to five per cent of the value of new lending to first time buyers can be above the 90 per cent LTV threshold limit.</p></reply>

This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current housing crisis, of which the Help to Buy incentive is one.  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy scheme should be considered.  Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the Help-to-Buy incentive on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.</p>  <p>   I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property prices on an ongoing basis.  However, the Help to Buy incentive, which came into effect at the start of this month, has been introduced for two reasons - to assist first time buyers in putting together the requisite deposit to buy a home, and to encourage the construction of new homes.  As such, I am not willing to abolish the Help to Buy incentive so soon after implementing it as this would not create the conditions to encourage the construction of new homes.</p>  <p>  I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the Help to Buy incentive which will look at, among other issues, the impact on property prices.  However, it should be remembered that the high rates of house prices reflect the supply constrained nature of the Irish residential market, and were an issue over the past number of years rather than since the start of the Help to Buy incentive.</p></reply>

However during the period from 2009 to 2015 there were underwriting losses of &euro;1.3bn, with motor insurance accounting for &euro;900m of this.  It should also be noted that the low interest rate environment has materially affected the levels of interest or investment income which insurers can earn and has reduced their ability to compensate in part for their underwriting losses.</p></reply>

Improve the composition of public finances by creating more room for tangible and intangible investment and ensure the effective functioning of national fiscal frameworks."</p>  <p>  The recommendation stops short, however, of advocating specific loosening by respective Member States to support the 0.5% of euro area GDP looser fiscal stance.</p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective, Government policy is to utilise the fiscal space available under the rules and this is reflected in Budget 2017, which was found to be broadly compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact, as per the 16th of November 2016 Commission Opinion.</p></reply>

Agreement was also reached on certain enhancements to the European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH), which along with EFSI is a pillar of the EU's response to the Investment crisis.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a consistent supporter of the European Union's efforts in response to the crisis in investment of which EFSI has been an important element since its establishment in 2015 as part of the broader Investment Plan for Europe.  Ireland's support has been based on a view of EFSI as being a potentially useful aid to Member States in funding projects that might not otherwise happen.  </p>  <p>  Led by the Department of Finance, Ireland engaged closely in the recent  EFSI extension negotiations.  Priorities central to this engagement focused on enhancements that might increase EFSI's geographic balance amongst Member States, its additionality in terms of funding projects that would not otherwise happen, as well as its impact on the real economy given the importance of our SME sector generally and the challenge posed to our economy generally by Brexit.</p>  <p>  Following the agreement amongst Council at the December European Council, the EFSI extension proposal negotiation will now continue with the European Parliament under the Maltese Presidency.  The intention ultimately is to reach an agreement with the European Parliament during the first half of 2017, if possible.</p></reply>

Any country or countries through which the goods might pass en route to their final destination are not reported. </p><p>If goods are exported to Great Britain, and are subsequently exported again by a British trader to a third country, the CSO data will show these goods as having been exported to Great Britain.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, the following tables give selected data on Irish exports and imports to and from Great Britain and Northern Ireland as recently presented in CSO's report &quot;Brexit - Ireland and the UK in Numbers&quot;.</p><p><b>Table A: Goods Exports 2015 classified by commodity</b><table><tr><th>Commodity</th><th>Total Exports &euro;000's</th><th>Exports - Great Britain &euro;000's</th><th>Exports Northern Ireland &euro;000's</th><th>% of Exports Great Britain</th><th>% of Exports Northern Ireland</th></tr><tr><td>Food and live animals</td><td>9,877,833</td><td>3,914,147</td><td>594,844</td><td>39.6</td><td>6.0</td></tr><tr><td>Beverages and tobacco</td><td>1,287,469</td><td>243,999</td><td>89,355</td><td>19.0</td><td>6.9</td></tr><tr><td>Crude materials, inedible, except fuels</td><td>1,770,659</td><td>393,744</td><td>74,370</td><td>22.2</td><td>4.2</td></tr><tr><td>Mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials</td><td>772,924</td><td>418,289</td><td>27,119</td><td>54.1</td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td>Animal and vegetables oils, fats and waxes</td><td>57,142</td><td>11,681</td><td>6,042</td><td>20.4</td><td>10.6</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals and related products</td><td>64,224,048</td><td>3,900,022</td><td>193,990</td><td>6.1</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Manufactured goods classified chiefly by material</td><td>2,105,212</td><td>915,357</td><td>233,006</td><td>43.5</td><td>11.1</td></tr><tr><td>Machinery and transport equipment</td><td>16,808,258</td><td>2,557,527</td><td>154,937</td><td>15.2</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous manufactured articles</td><td>14,298,763</td><td>1,120,212</td><td>200,811</td><td>7.8</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Commodities and transactions not classified elsewhere</td><td>1,205,035</td><td>335,168</td><td>169,651</td><td>27.8</td><td>14.1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>112,407,343</td><td>13,810,147</td><td>1,744,125</td><td>12.3</td><td>1.6</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table B: Goods Imports 2015 classified by commodity</b><table><tr><th>Commodity</th><th>Total Imports - &euro;000's</th><th>Imports Great Britain - &euro;000's</th><th>Imports Northern Ireland - &euro;000's</th><th>% of Imports Great Britain</th><th>% of Imports Northern Ireland</th></tr><tr><td>Food and live animals</td><td>6,686,796</td><td>2,842,473</td><td>483,907</td><td>42.5</td><td>7.2</td></tr><tr><td>Beverages and tobacco</td><td>876,066</td><td>305,119</td><td>32,452</td><td>34.8</td><td>3.7</td></tr><tr><td>Crude materials, inedible,  except fuels</td><td>854,625</td><td>162,863</td><td>59,948</td><td>19.1</td><td>7.0</td></tr><tr><td>Mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials</td><td>5,104,270</td><td>3,140,700</td><td>33,296</td><td>61.5</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Animal and vegetables oils, fats and waxes</td><td>244,545</td><td>45,463</td><td>17,375</td><td>18.6</td><td>7.1</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals and related products</td><td>13,977,824</td><td>2,391,244</td><td>64,523</td><td>17.1</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Manufactured goods classified chiefly by material</td><td>4,697,709</td><td>1,796,843</td><td>127,536</td><td>38.2</td><td>2.7</td></tr><tr><td>Machinery and transport equipment</td><td>27,890,812</td><td>2,963,996</td><td>89,698</td><td>10.6</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous manufactured articles</td><td>8,166,076</td><td>2,443,560</td><td>75,986</td><td>29.9</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>Commodities and transactions not classified elsewhere</td><td>1,612,285</td><td>810,744</td><td>106,622</td><td>50.3</td><td>6.6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>70,111,009</td><td>16,903,005</td><td>1,091,343</td><td>24.1</td><td>1.6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 to the Act.  However, such exemptions specifically include any "domestic premises" except for apartments which may be rateable in certain limited circumstances specified in the Act.</p>  <p>  Arising from Schedule 4 to the Act, domestic premises which provide Bed and Breakfast type accommodation and/or lodgings are not rateable.  Similarly, apartments that are used as domestic premises are not rateable.  However, apartments which are used for the purposes of the trade of hotel-keeping (referred to as "apart-hotels" in the Act) are rateable.</p>  <p>  Under Section 27 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, an occupier of a property, a rating authority, an interest holder in a property or the occupier of any other property in that rating authority area may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Valuation for a revision of valuation.  Similarly, those parties can also apply to have a property entered on a valuation list.  Any party dissatisfied with the outcome of such an application may appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</p>  <p>  Once a property has been valued and entered on a valuation list, the calculation, collection and payment of rates is entirely a matter for the rating authority concerned.</p></reply>

With regard to the Convention article which is the subject of the Deputy's question, Ireland is already compliant. </p>  <p>  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has published guidelines on how the Irish immigration system deals with cases of domestic violence where the victim is a foreign national whose immigration status is currently derived from or dependant on that of the perpetrator.  The key element is to offer the victim an avenue to obtain independent immigration status is his/her own right.  The guidelines set out the options that people have in these circumstances.</p>  <p>  INIS considers each case on its merits.  INIS requires as much information as possible to make a decision.  The application for independent status as a victim of domestic violence should set out details of the domestic violence suffered and make a request for independent immigration status.  Any relevant family circumstances, especially whether there are any children involved, should be disclosed.</p>  <p>  The sort of supporting material INIS looks for to establish that domestic violence is being suffered would include Protection Orders; Safety Orders or Barring Orders from the Courts; medical reports; Garda incident reports; a letter from a State body such as the HSE; a letter of support from a domestic violence support organisation etc.</p>  <p>  Generally the immigration status granted would be at the same level as that which was previously held as a dependant.  The main difference is that this status is no longer dependent on the spouse or partner and that person will have no say in whether the applicant is permitted to stay in Ireland.  Where it becomes necessary for the victim to work to support themselves or family members lawfully residing in the State, an appropriate status can be granted.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  The Lucan and Clondalkin Garda Districts form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division and I am informed that on the 30 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the Garda strength of the Lucan District was 164, of whom 6 were Community Garda&iacute; and the strength of the Clondalkin District was 197, of whom 7 were Community Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide, including 62 to the DMR West Division.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p>  <p>  The focus on investment in personnel is critical. While it is the case, as advised by the Commissioner, that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of dedicated Community Garda&iacute; throughout the state.  We are now rebuilding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

The Act is being commenced on a phased basis and it is my intention that the new decision-making support options provided for in the Act will be substantially implemented during 2017.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (which is a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act come into force.  My Department is working carefully on this at present in consultation with the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  Part 2 of the Act (section 8) provides for the guiding principles that will apply before and during an intervention under the Act in relation to a "relevant person", which is a person whose capacity is in question or may shortly be in question in respect of one or more matters or who lacks capacity in respect of one or more matters.  Section 2 of the Act defines an &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; as meaning an action, order or direction under the Act in respect of a relevant person done by (a) the Circuit Court or High Court, (b) a decision-making assistant, co-decision maker, decision-making representative, attorney or designated healthcare representative, (c) the Director of the Decision Support Service, (d) a special visitor or general visitor, or (e) a healthcare professional.</p>  <p>  The guiding principles in section 8 of the Act link into the continuum of decision-support options provided for in the Act to respond to the needs of persons with capacity difficulties.  Persons who make interventions under the Act must abide by these general principles.  Section 8(5) provides that there shall be no intervention unless it is necessary to do so having regard to the individual circumstances of the relevant person.</p>  <p>  As Part 2 of the Act is so closely connected with the new decision-making support options provided for in the Act, I am of the view that it would be premature to commence Part 2 until the Decision Support Service has been established and is ready to begin the implementation of the substantive provisions of the Act.</p></reply>

The homeowner contacts MABS, which will assess their situation and can refer them for advice and assistance from a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP), a solicitor or an accountant, depending on their needs and options.  This professional advice and assistance is provided free of charge to the homeowner, under a Scheme voucher issued by MABS, by a professional adviser from one of the panels established and regulated under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, the borrower is free to choose a professional adviser from the panel, subject to availability, and this is stated on page 1 of the Scheme's information booklet for borrowers.  The ISI has established the panel of PIPs who are available to provide advice and assistance under the Abhaile Scheme, and this is published on the ISI website.  The borrower is free under the Scheme to choose any PIP from the panel, subject to availability.  The website provides contact details for each PIP and indicates in which county he or she is based.  However, many PIPs provide services across a number of counties, and the website indicates that the borrower is free to contact any of the PIPs on the panel.</p>  <p>  The solicitor panels set up by the Legal Aid Board are by court area.  The Board has 3 solicitors on the Abhaile panel for the Trim Circuit Court area which is the only Circuit court in County Meath - the designated Court for listing of home repossession cases.</p></reply>

Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency in the Garda vetting systems has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system  which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated.</p>  <p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p></reply>

However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirements of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identifying the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance to Road Traffic Legislation.  Combined with this data I am informed that the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event/Emergency Management is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.

We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Kerry, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p></reply>

Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so.</p>  <p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report.  The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made in such cases as part of the transaction, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product.  The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees.  Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  Moreover, under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol to any person for consumption off his or her premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.</p></reply>

While the general principle<b></b>as set out in <i>Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann</i>is that justice be administered in public, the underlying concern is that family law proceedings relate to matters which are sensitive and private to the parties and there is no public interest in requiring that their identities be published.  The <i>in camera</i>rule offers protection to other family members from the publication or broadcasting of information relating to them which would affect the anonymity of the parties or any child concerned.</p><p>The operation of the <i>in camera</i>rule was reviewed by the last Government on foot of a commitment in the previous Programme for Government to reform and modernise aspects of family law.  As a consequence of this review, the <i>in camera</i>rule was modified by Part 2 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 to allow <i>bona fide</i>members of the press to be present in court during family law and child care proceedings and to report on such proceedings subject to strict conditions.  This reform of the <i>in camera</i>rule was made to enable the media, researchers and legal professionals to gain access to valuable information on the operation of the law in this area.  We have all seen the results of this change in the form of increased coverage of family law proceedings in both print and other media.  This coverage has proven in the round to be very responsible, in that while public interest issues have been highlighted for debate, this has been done in such a way as to protect identities of individuals involved.  It is also, of course, very informative in terms of policy making and review.</p><p>However, it is open to the court to exclude representatives of the media from the court or otherwise restrict their attendance during the hearing or parts of it, or restrict or prohibit the publication or broadcasting of evidence given or referred to during the proceedings.  The court may impose these restrictions where it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so (i) to preserve the anonymity of a party to the proceedings or any child to whom the proceedings relate, (ii) by reason of the nature or circumstances of the case, or (iii) if otherwise necessary in the interests of justice.</p><p>Section 40A of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 prohibits the publication or broadcasting of any information which would be likely to lead members of the public to identify the parties to family law proceedings or any children to whom the proceedings relate.  Anyone breaching this prohibition will be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, or if convicted on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both.  Section 31 of the Child Care Act 1991 contains a similar prohibition in relation to child care cases.</p><p>I am satisfied that these provisions are sufficiently robust and that there is no need at the present time for a further review of the <i>in camera</i>rule in family law cases.</p></reply>

Further, a module on cyber crime investigation has been included in the training programme for all trainee Garda&iacute;, with all other Garda personnel receiving training in cyber crime awareness and cyber crime investigation through the Garda Continuous Professional Development network.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Bureau is also supported by the significant investment of some &euro;330 million in Garda ICT infrastructure, including &euro;205 million under the Government's Capital Plan, between 2016 and 2021.  This investment will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime and will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective policing services in response to the evolving challenges of modern day criminal activity, including cyber crime.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-17a.283.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017011700066#WRE04300"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, I have no direct role in the enforcement of Road Traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they conduct a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding.  By working together with the Road Safety Authority and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour through public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership.</p>  <p>  Underpinning this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.  One of the focuses of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations will specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions.  Speed will continue to be a primary focus of Garda enforcement activities through the deployment of high visibility patrols in conjunction with safety camera vans and the use of hand-held speed detection devices.</p>  <p>  This targeted approach to speed enforcement is undertaken in order to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety.  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (formerly the National Roads Authority), completed an extensive analysis of the collision history on the road network.  Sections of road were identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred whereby speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.  Based on this analysis, a list of speed enforcement zones has been developed with the aim of providing information to motorists in order to raise awareness of speeding in these zones.</p>  <p>  Since May 2016 there are 1,031 speed enforcement zones nationwide where safety cameras operate.  Prior to the introduction of safety cameras, approximately 31% of fatal collisions occurred in these zones.  In 2015, this figure had reduced to 14%.  This shows a dramatic reduction in terms of risk in these areas and a huge increase in terms of road safety.</p>  <p>  The locations of these speed enforcement zones are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.  These speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed in light of ongoing survey data, collision history and local feedback to ensure that enforcement activity is properly targeted.</p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.</p>  <p>  Road safety is a shared responsibility, one which, as you are aware, the Government take very seriously.  Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 - 2020) aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of safest countries in the EU and beyond.  To achieve this, we are continuing to work together in partnership.  I attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Road Safety recently, along with the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and generally meets twice a year; however, in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the meeting was brought forward to January.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together all stakeholders to see what immediate actions could be taken to reverse the upward trend in road fatalities.  During this meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore.</p></reply>

Under this decision, the Government confirmed that Ireland will take in up to 4,000 persons in order to give effect to the EU legal instruments it has opted into, with approval of the Oireachtas, in respect of relocation and the solemn commitments Ireland has also entered into in respect of resettled refugees.</p><p>The figure of 4,000 includes 2,622 asylum seekers to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU relocation programme and 1,040 programme refugees from Lebanon which the Irish Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2017 under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement Programme.  Up to two hundred unaccompanied minors from the former refugee camps in Calais may be admitted from France.  The mechanism by which the balance will be admitted has yet to be decided by Government.</p><p>Among the measures agreed under the Programme was the establishment of a Network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs)  which would be used to provide initial accommodation in order to meet the basic needs of asylum seekers relocated from hot spots in Italy and Greece while their applications for refugee status are processed.</p><p>In addition, the Government has committed under the Programme to take in additional resettled refugees who must also be temporally accommodated in EROCs for the purposes of reception, orientation and integration training, prior to being resettled in communities across Ireland.  In this specific regard two EROCs were opened in the past year, one in County Kildare and one in Co. Waterford.</p><p>Those coming in as relocated asylum seekers via Greece/Italy are managed by the Programme Office of the IRPP.  Those destined for the new Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon, will be asylum seekers coming via the Greece/Italy route.  As this cohort will receive a grant of international protection within a period of 8-12 weeks, their stay in EROCs is intended to be short-term after which they will be housed somewhere in Ireland.</p><p>In terms of the resettlement in local communities of refugees temporarily accommodated in EROCs, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has established a Taskforce to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  Senior Officials from Government departments and key agencies, including the City and County Managers Association, sit on the Taskforce.  A sub-committee of the Taskforce, established to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and composed of senior officials from Government Departments including the City and County Managers Association, is working on a distribution key to inform the distribution of refugees admitted under the programmes across the country.  To-date, refugees have been resettled in Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway and Mayo.  In advance of each resettlement, work takes place with each receiving Local Authority and local service providers to prepare for the arrival of the refugees in the community.  Initially, meetings take place with statutory service providers only.  Once the initial phase is over, representatives of local NGOs and the Community and Voluntary Sector are invited to join the Inter-agency Working Group to support the resettlement programme at a local level.  Funding is provided through the Local Authority to support the work of local Community Groups which includes the recruitment of a full or part-time Resettlement Support Worker.  The amount of funding available will depend, inter-alia, on the number of refugees resettled and the number of locations involved.  The Local Authority must submit an application for funding but is supported though the funding process by an experienced member of the resettlement team of my Department.  Over the next 18 months, refugees will be resettled in counties around the country until the full cohort of refugees have arrived in Ireland and have been resettled into the community.  Over that period it is likely that County Donegal will be expected to house a representative proportion of the refugees admitted to Ireland.  It is not possible at this stage to say how many of these refugees might go to Donegal in 2017, and discussions are ongoing with the local authority in this regard.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>I am advised that Garda Drug Units personnel are assigned on a Divisional basis.  Ballymun and Santry Garda Stations are located in the Ballymun Garda District which forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan North (DMR North) Division while Finglas Garda Station is located in the Cabra Garda District which forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan West (DMR West) Division.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 30 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 233 members assigned to the Garda Divisional Drugs Units, of whom 22 were assigned to the DMR North Divisional Drugs Unit and 20 to the DMR West Divisional Drugs Unit.</p><p>It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that so far 52 and 62 of these probationer Garda have been assigned to the DMR North and DMR West Divisions respectively.  I am further informed that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p><p>Drug law enforcement activities and all other Garda activities will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.</p><p>The investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and support the delivery of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.</p><p>The strength of the Drug Units for DMR North and DMR West Divisions from the years 2012 to 30 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the tables below.<table><tr><th colspan="6">DMR North and DMR North West Garda Divisional Drugs Unit Strength 2012-2016</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North</td><td>31</td><td>27</td><td>16</td><td>25</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>DMR West</td><td>28</td><td>26</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>20</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A report was sought from the Garda Commissioner on the matter at that time and that report was provided to my predecessor in March 2011.  The report noted that no evidence had been established that the person in question had been involved in any criminal activity while in this jurisdiction.  That said, if any evidence of any criminal wrongdoing is available it should be brought to the Garda Authorities in order that it might be fully investigated.</p>  <p>  As I have stated to the House previously, in the light of developments which have taken place outside this jurisdiction since these matters first came to light, including the establishment by the UK Government of an inquiry (the Pitchford Inquiry) into undercover policing, I requested a fresh report from the Garda Commissioner on any issues arising.  In seeking that report, I have not sought to circumscribe in any way the information which the Garda Commissioner would provide.  I will fully consider this report when it is available, including the issue of whether it may be suitable for publication.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Pitchford Inquiry into undercover policing is a matter for the UK Government and the question of my seeking to have its terms of reference extended does not arise.  I would, however, reiterate the point I have made previously that should anything emerge from the findings of the Pitchford Inquiry that would be relevant to policing in this jurisdiction I will consider it fully and take any action that may be required.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in 2015  a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB).</p>  <p>  The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly.  In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.  As part of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff.  These PSUs are to ensure a consistent approach to domestic abuse and sexual crime, which will be supported by the national Bureau.  The PSUs will work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that these Divisional PSUs are being rolled-out in two phases.  Phase 1 involves the establishment of three Units over a 12-month period on a pilot basis.  The pilot Divisions that have been identified are the DMR West, Cork City, and the Louth Division.  The assessment of this pilot phase will inform the bigger roll-out to each Garda Division.</p>  <p>  This initiative is being managed by Detective Chief Superintendent, Garda National Protective Services Bureau in conjunction with each Divisional Officer and the Strategic Transformation Office which is overseeing the delivery of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme.</p></reply>

Part 4 of the Act makes provision for the operation of the Garda Diversion Programme under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.</p>  <p>  To support the operation of the Diversion Programme, my Department, through the Irish Youth Justice Service, funds some 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects around the country.  These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime/anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, some &euro;12m was allocated by the Irish Youth Justice Service to Garda Youth Diversion Projects and a number of other youth justice community based projects around the country.  Similar monies will be expended in 2017.  In addition, monies secured from the Dormant Accounts Fund supported the establishment of ten new projects in the period 2015/2016.</p>  <p>  The Irish Youth Justice Service working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the need for Garda Youth Diversion Projects on an ongoing basis.  This is achieved in the main through the Garda Youth Diversion Projects annual planning and budget application process.  The provision of youth crime statistical information by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service to all Garda Youth Diversion Projects is an integral part of the annual planning process undertaken by the projects.  When completed, these plans provide details in relation to youth crime in the relevant catchment area, numbers of persons referred to the Diversion Programme and the programmes and interventions to be implemented in relation to young people admitted to the projects.  These plans are assessed by the Irish Youth Justice Service and support it in its monitoring and oversight role in relation to the projects and with any decisions required to be taken in relation to reviewing or restructuring the provision of services in particular areas.  The Annual Plans for 2017 are currently being assessed by the Irish Youth Justice Service.</p>  <p>  Developments which could have implications in the future for the Garda Youth Diversion Projects include the report of the Review Group established by the Garda Commissioner to examine the operation of the statutory Diversion Programme, the recommendation of the Penal Policy Review Group that a diversion programme be established for offenders aged eighteen to twenty four years, and the Programme for Government commitment to support the expansion of Garda Youth Diversion Projects to that particular age cohort.</p>  <p>  The operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects have undergone significant development in recent years with the introduction of revised annual planning and budget application and reporting processes.  In addition, a comprehensive risk/needs assessment tool has been introduced.  The tool is used in the projects to assess the risk of recidivism in young people and developing a case management plan on the basis of the specific risks and needs of the individual.  This allows interventions to be tailored appropriately and lead to more positive outcomes for young people.  In addition, a new Garda Youth Diversion Project service delivery model has been introduced in County Kerry which, following its evaluation, may give rise to similar models being introduced in other counties.</p>  <p>  The operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects will continue to undergo development, all the time ensuring that they are located in the areas where the need is greatest having regard to both the quantity and profile of youth crime and its underlying circumstances.  Such information will continue to inform decision making in relation to the reform or restructuring of projects and service delivery, or altering project catchment areas.</p></reply>

The Residential Property Price Register, available at www.propertypriceregister.ie, is produced by the PSRA in accordance with the provisions of Section 86 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  The purpose of the Register is to bring transparency to house prices in Ireland.  The Register is a list of property prices and it is not a "property price index".  The details made available on the register are limited to price, address and date of sale and do not include such details as property size or number of rooms.  It is simply designed to provide, on an ongoing basis, accurate prices of residential properties purchased at a particular date.</p>  <p>  The Register contains information on residential properties purchased in Ireland since 1 January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes, and forwarded by the Revenue Commissioners to the PSRA for publication.  I am informed that VAT at 13.5% is only chargeable on new properties; it is not charged on second hand properties.  Stamp duty in respect of new properties is paid on the property price exclusive of VAT.  Accordingly, the prices given to the PSRA by the Revenue Commissioners for new properties are VAT exclusive.  The Information Note on the first page of the Residential Property Price Register clearly states that if the property is a new property, the price shown is exclusive of VAT at 13.5%.</p></reply>

This provides a round-the-clock service which enables garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE. As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.

No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment. On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers. In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act were also completed. This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas. Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority in accordance with the Act. </p>  <p>The Authority, which has eleven members including a lay majority and lay-Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 and has been meeting monthly since then with its next meeting scheduled for 19 January 2017.  Initial office accommodation and has been provided for the Authority by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level in support of its start-up phase. Funding support of &euro;1 million has also been provided to the new Authority  by my Department in December on a strictly recoupable basis as the new Authority will be self-funding by levy. In the building up of capacity and resources to become fully operational, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has recently appointed a person to fulfil the duties of its Chief Executive on a solely interim basis to drive the initial start-up phase. At the same time this will enable the Authority to prepare the way for the public recruitment of a full-time Chief Executive in the coming months having had the opportunity to more clearly identify its existing and future management needs and capacities in real time. </p>  <p>As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns have furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a). On 5 December 2016, under S.I. No. 630   of 2016, I also commenced sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act. These provisions set statutory delivery deadlines for the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned. These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on barristers in relation to direct access on contentious matters and the holding of clients' monies. The working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions in tandem with the phased commencement during the year of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  Against this background, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented in the first half of this year. The current focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with the introduction of a more transparent legal cost regime, the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers and the separate introduction under the Act of Pre-Action Protocols. It also includes the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator which is a substantial structural reform of an office of the High Court and for which I have also introduced and commenced additional supporting measures under the Courts Bill which was enacted on 28 December 2016. Following these steps the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced. </p>  <p>  These are tasks for which I know the new Authority, with the direct engagement of its interim Chief Executive, is actively building up its working resources in the short term. My Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.</p></reply>

I am aware of the High Court decision referenced and wish to reassure the Deputy that this is currently being examined by my Department and the matter will be kept under review in terms of any definitive additional obligations arising.  </p><p>In relation to County Registrars, as a matter of law, a County Registrar may only make an order for possession of any land in cases where no defence to an action for possession has been delivered by the defendant or no appearance has been entered by the defendant.  Therefore the power of a County Registrar as regards making possession orders is extremely limited and where any defence is raised by the defendant, including any defence in relation to the nature or terms of the mortgage contract between the borrower and lender, the matter must, when it is in order for hearing, be transferred by the County Registrar to the judge's list at the first opportunity.  At that point it would be a matter for the judge to consider any such issues raised, including, if applicable, issues in relation to the EU Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts which was given effect to in Ireland by Regulations in 1995 and amending Regulations in 2000 and in 2013.  In addition, all orders of a County Registrar are subject to appeal to the Circuit Court. </p><p>The Directive and Regulations are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and it is understood that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has supervisory powers to ensure compliance with the legislation.</p><p>The raising of this issue in relation to the matters for consideration by the Court in a possession case underlines the critical importance of people who are in mortgage arrears on their homes and who have been issued with legal proceedings engaging with their lender and with the court processes and entering a defence for the consideration of the court where they believe that they have a defence. If they engage with the court processes they will be subject to various forms of statutory and non statutory protection including the provisions of special legislation introduced in 2013 and 2015 and also the ability to avail of the free legal and financial advice services provided for under the Government's Abhaile service introduced in October 2016.  </p><p>It is already the case, since special insolvency legislation passed in 2015, that a PIA (personal insolvency arrangement), the key statutory insolvency measure which has the objective of keeping a homeowner in arrears in the family home and restoring him/her to solvency, can be imposed by the court in particular circumstances where it has been rejected by the creditors. It is also the case that, under Section 2 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 the Circuit Court may, in any repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower's principal private residence, adjourn proceedings so that a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may be fully explored as an alternative to repossession.  The Act provides for an initial adjournment period not exceeding 2 months, with the possibility of further adjournments where it considers that progress has been made on preparing a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA).</p><p>The concentration during the latter part of 2016 was to get the new Government Abhaile service up and running and producing results as the new national mortgage arrears resolution service, operating with MABS (the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which has a network of offices across the country) as the key point of entry.  This now ensures that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner. Under this Scheme, home owners who are in arrears on their home mortgage and at risk of losing their homes are provided with access to free independent expert financial and legal advice and assistance, so that a solution can be put in place that will deal with their debt and keep them in their home, where that is a sustainable option.</p><p>The Abhaile service is in addition to the help already available from MABS to homeowners in mortgage arrears. This includes the presence of MABS court mentors at all Circuit Court repossession hearings across the country to provide information and assistance to unrepresented borrowers; and providing in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers (DMA advisers) in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate on behalf of borrowers in mortgage arrears. </p><p>Over 3,700 vouchers for financial or legal advice and assistance were issued under Abhaile between 22 July and 13 January 2017, of which over 3,000 were requested for consultations and assistance with Personal Insolvency Practitioners.　The Abhaile Scheme includes provision for free legal aid for homeowners where a PIA which includes arrears on the home mortgage has been rejected by creditors and an application needs to be made to the Court to review the case and impose the arrangement where applicable. Legal Aid has been approved under the Abhaile Scheme in over 100 such cases, up to 13 January 2017.</p><p>During 2015, the Insolvency Service of Ireland helped almost 1,700 debtors secure permanent debt solutions that returned them to solvency, up from 996 in 2014. </p><p>The number of people availing of solutions through the Insolvency Service of Ireland continued to grow in 2016. During 2015 ISI received 2,028 applications, 1,371 Protective Certificates were issued and almost 1,700 permanent solutions for debtors were put in place. In the year Quarter 4 of 2015 to Quarter 3 of 2016, the latest full year figures that are available, the ISI received 2,731 applications, 1,581 Protective Certificates were issued and almost 1,800 permanent solutions for debtors were put in place. The number of solutions for this period is expected to increase further over the coming months, as the outcomes of vouchers issued under the Abhaile Scheme come to fruition and as personal insolvency review cases currently before the courts are decided or settled.</p><p>Continuing education for the Irish judiciary is facilitated by the Committee for Judicial Studies and any person appointed to judicial office agrees to take such course or courses of training or education, or both, as may be required by the Chief Justice or President of the court to which that person is appointed.</p></reply>

These difficulties are compounded where the warrant has been outstanding for some years.  However, I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na execute warrants as expeditiously as possible, giving priority to the execution of warrants relating to serious crimes. </p><p>The Deputy will also appreciate that the figure for outstanding bench warrants recorded by PULSE at any given time reflects an accumulation of old bench warrants which has arisen over the years and that therefore the total figure for outstanding bench warrants as shown on PULSE may not be a reliable indicator of the number of 'live' warrants which are actually enforceable.  A welcome analysis of this issue was provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in their report on Crime Investigation of November 2014.  The Inspectorate Report acknowledges the difficulties often faced by Garda&iacute; in pursuing the execution of warrants but it also points to deficiencies in the current systems, some of which are tied to the available technology for recording and monitoring information on warrants.  In this regard the Government is providing a very important investment in new Garda technology under the Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021; some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. </p><p>In addition, as part of the overall strategic transformation programme underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Warrants Review Group has been working on means of better managing and enforcing warrants taking on board the Inspectorate's analysis.  I am advised that a number of improvements have been put in place, including greater use of clerical support staff which helps to free up Garda&iacute; to concentrate on the execution as opposed to the administration of warrants.  I am further advised that warrants enforcement is a recurring agenda item at Garda Senior Management Meetings, as well as regional performance and accountability meetings, to ensure that the situation is continually monitored.</p><p>The statistical information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below.<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>No. of unexecuted Bench Warrants *</th></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>242</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>152</td></tr></table>* <i>Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change and are valid to 10</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i>January, 2017.</i></p></reply>

The Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 stipulates that two appointees must be practising solicitors and two must be practising barristers. There is a further requirement for two staff nominees with one of these generally a practising solicitor with the Board.  </p>  <p>  The role of the statutory Board is to provide strategic guidance to the organisation and to monitor the activities and effectiveness of management. It also has a role in developing policy. Board members do not have an executive role and they are not involved in decision making on individual cases save in considering appeals against decisions by the Executive to refuse legal aid applications made on behalf of individual clients. It is a statutory requirement that the Appeal Committee has two practising lawyers, as well as members in reserve.  The Board has a Corporate Governance Manual that seeks to address any potential conflict of interest situations and it is express practice that any Committee member who has a conflict of interest in relation to a particular application does not sit on the Committee for the purpose of that application. </p>  <p>  The Board has been well served by many eminent lawyers since its establishment and I think the Deputy will appreciate that handling any potential conflict is an inherent part of lawyers work.  It does not follow that there is any conflict of interest where a lawyer instructed in a case happens to be a member of the Board simply because one of the parties is legally aided - such a case is conducted in the same way as any other case.  There may be occasional circumstances in which such a conflict could arise, however I am satisfied that the Board has suitable arrangements in place to address this.  </p></reply>

I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country. </p><p>As you are aware, I have no direct role in the enforcement of Road Traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that table below shows the number of incidents of 'Driving Under the Influence' recorded, by Garda Division, for the period 1 December 2016 to 8 January 2017.  The figures are provided by Garda Division as the information requested is not recorded on a County-by-County basis. <table><tr><th></th><th>Number of incidents of Driving Under the Influence recorded, by Garda Division, for the period 1 Dec 2016 to 8 Jan 2017*</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>No. of Incidents</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region East</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region North Central</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region North</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region South</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region West</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>961</td></tr></table>*These figures are provisional, operational and subject to change and are valid to 10 January 2017. </p><p>Road safety is a shared responsibility; one which, as you are aware, the Government takes very seriously.  Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 - 2020) aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of safest countries in the EU and beyond.  To achieve this, we are continuing to work together in partnership.  I attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Road Safety recently, along with the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and generally meets twice a year; however in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the meeting was brought forward to January.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together all stakeholders to see what immediate actions could be taken to reverse the upward trend in road fatalities. During this meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore. </p><p>Following this meeting, my colleague Minister Ross announced that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with an intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will in future receive a mandatory disqualification.</p></reply>

In this specific regard two EROCs were opened in the past year, one in Co. Kildare and one in Co. Waterford.   </p>  <p>  Those coming in as relocated asylum seekers via Greece/Italy are managed by the Programme Office of the IRPP.  Those destined for the new Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon will be asylum seekers coming via the Greece/Italy route. As this cohort are expected to receive a grant of international protection within a period of 8-12 weeks, their stay in EROCs is intended to be short-term after which they will be housed elsewhere in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In terms of the resettlement in local communities of refugees temporarily accommodated in EROCs, the Deputy will be aware that the Government have established a Taskforce to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  Senior Officials from Government departments and key agencies, including the City and County Managers Association, sit on the Taskforce.  A sub-committee of the Taskforce, established be me to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and composed of senior officials from Government Departments including the City and County Managers Association, are working on a distribution key  to inform the distribution of refugees admitted under the programmes across the country.  To-date, refugees have been resettled in Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway and Mayo.  Over the next 18 months, refugees will be resettled in other counties around the country until the full cohort of refugees have arrived in Ireland and have been resettled into the community.  Therefore at some point over that period it is highly likely that County Cavan and County Monaghan will be asked to house a proportion of the refugees admitted to Ireland.  As is the case with counties that have already accepted refugees, appropriate structures and funding mechanisms will be put in place prior to this happening.</p></reply>

The Garda authorities will continue to target those involved and to work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in combatting these groups.  The Garda&iacute; and the PSNI deserve praise for their ongoing work in this regard. </p><p>As an open and democratic society in the European Union, Ireland cannot consider itself immune from the current international terrorist threat.  The assessment of the threat is that while an attack on Ireland is possible, it is not considered likely.  Nor is there at present any specific information that an attack on Ireland is planned.  The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international situation.</p><p>The Garda authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures proportionate to the level of terrorist threat and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  The Deputy will understand, of course, that the detail of such security measures should not be disclosed publicly.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  In addition, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support where needed.</p><p>While there are a number of persons here whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern they will continue to be monitored closely by the Garda authorities and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard. </p><p>The Garda Authorities will continue to work closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combatting terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.</p></reply>

The Report was not carried forward by the Government of the day. The implementation of the Report at this remove, and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged would require a detailed consideration of the merits and impacts in the public interest, including in terms of the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer. The areas of law involved include consumer protection, competition, the environment and the provision of financial and other services. Consideration would also have to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at the national, European Union and wider international levels.

The Reserve perform policing  duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;. Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas. Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;. In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.</p><p>The age at which any candidate may apply to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a full time member is set by Regulation 4 (a) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013. It is set at not more than 35 years. </p><p>This upper age limit of 35 was set having regard to equality legislation and also took into account the following criteria:</p><p>(1)  the cost of training and the need for recruits to serve for a sufficient period of time as full members of the service to recoup this cost,</p><p>(2)  the operational requirements of the service in terms of having an age profile appropriate to the physical demands placed on members in the course of their duty. </p><p>This Regulation applies without discrimination and no concessions are available to any person.There are currently no plans to change this situation.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>The 2013 Regulations provide that special recognition may be given to Reserve members in the context of the selection process as they have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have gained experience in operational policing.  The recruitment campaign for 2016 included for the first time a special stream for eligible members of the Reserve.  This special stream was continued in the most recent campaign. To be eligible for the special Reserve stream a reserve member is required to have completed their probation, performed their role to a satisfactory standard, and served a minimum of 150 hours per year for two of the previous four years. The Reserve stream is essentially a fast-track stream in that it allows the eligible reserves to skip stage 1 (unsupervised on-line tests) of the competitive assessment process and move straight to stage 2 which consists of supervised assessment tests taken in an assessment centre. Those who meet the required standard are then called to a competency based interview. Successful candidates are fast tracked through the medical, fitness and vetting assessments undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

This Act continues to provide a range of possible remedies for debenture holders and lending institutions in the event of a borrower encountering financial difficulties. These include the appointment of a receiver, an examinership process, and liquidation in those cases in which the company is beyond rescue. The Act includes detailed provisions which regulate the appointment and the powers of receivers, examiners and liquidators respectively. However, while the 2014 Act contains provisions specifying qualifications in the case of examiners and liquidators, it does not specify any such standards for the appointment of a receiver. </p>  <p>  As regards further regulation in relation to receivers, I am advised that the Company Law Review Group is the statutory body which advises the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the review and development of company law in this jurisdiction. It would be a matter for the Group to consider whether further amendment of company law in relation to receivers would be desirable or necessary. </p>  <p>  The position regarding the appointment of a receiver is that such an appointment may be made under company law or land and conveyancing law (the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 in the case of mortgages created after 1 December 2009, and the Conveyancing Act 1881 for mortgages created prior to that date). Depending on the circumstances of the case, courts may also, on application from a secured creditor, exercise their discretionary powers to appoint a receiver. Apart from these sources, the instrument creating a charge or mortgage may also contain contractual terms in relation to appointment of a receiver and provide for additional powers which such a receiver may exercise on his or her appointment.</p></reply>

I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country. </p><p>As you are aware, I have no direct role in the enforcement of Road Traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the table below shows the number of Mandatory Alcohol (MAT) Checkpoints recorded in each of the Garda divisions comprising Cork City and County for the period 1 December 2016 to 8 January 2017 and the same period for 2015/2016.  Figures are provided by Garda Division as the information requested is not recorded on a County-by-County basis. <table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Number of Mandatory Alcohol (MAT) Checkpoints </th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>1 Dec 2015 to 8 January 2016</td><td>1 Dec 2016 to 8 January 2017*</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>450</td><td>731</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>780</td><td>790</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>654</td><td>1,030</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,884</td><td>2,551</td></tr></table>*These figures are provisional, operational and subject to change and are valid to 10 January 2017. </p><p>Road safety is a shared responsibility, one which, as you are aware, the Government takes very seriously.  Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 - 2020) aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of safest countries in the EU and beyond.  To achieve this, we are continuing to work together in partnership.  I attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Road Safety recently, along with the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and generally meets twice a year; however in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the meeting was brought forward to January.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together all stakeholders to see what immediate actions could be taken to reverse the upward trend in road fatalities. During this meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore. </p><p>Following this meeting, my colleague Minister Ross announced that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with an intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will in future receive a mandatory disqualification.</p></reply>

The AMIF has four specific objectives relating to asylum (including resettlement), integration, return, and solidarity (relocation).  Of the &euro;19.519 million allocated to Ireland, &euro;5.455 million is earmarked in our National Programme for integration.  There is provision for switching allocations between specific objectives depending on where a greater need might arise and, therefore, I am confident that our national allocation will be spent by end 2022.</p>  <p>  I launched the first call for applications under the Fund on 22 September last with a closing date of 10 November.  This call focused on the asylum and integration areas and aimed to make &euro;4.5 million available over the period 2017 to 2020.  I understand that the decision on applications (in which neither the T&aacute;naiste nor I have a personal input) is imminent and that the funds available will be substantially allocated.  It is not possible at this stage to say how much will be allocated for each specific objective and, indeed, many applications addressed both asylum and integration.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Donegal, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>The first attestation of trainee Garda&iacute; in 2017 will take place on 2 February and their allocation will be a matter for the Commissioner. I am informed by  the Commissioner that 8 and 5 newly attested Garda&iacute; were allocated to Letterkenny Garda District in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Due to the moratorium on recruitment there were no attestations in the period 2012-2014.  I have requested the information sought for the years 2006- 2011 from the Commissioner and when it is to hand I will provide it to the Deputy. </p></reply>

As the name suggest, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently resettled.  The overwhelming majority of persons being relocated to Ireland are Syrian.</p>  <p>  The services provided to people arriving from Syria will include education, GP services, HSE medical screening, and access to the services of the Department of Social Protection.  A core part of the job of the IRPP is coordination and ensuring appropriate service delivery.  Staff of the IRPP hold weekly clinics in the EROC with clients and any service level issues become immediately apparent.</p>  <p>  The relevant services will be provided locally or in some cases may be provided at the centre.  The mode of service provision is determined on a case by case basis depending on the local situation and the individual circumstances of the asylum seekers.  Every effort is made to mainstream services with local populations while not impacting on the delivery of local services.  Thus children may attend local schools and adults will be provided with English language classes by the local ETB.  Services can in some instances be provided directly to the children and adults although the preference is that they are provided in conjunction with local services as this helps significantly with integration.  It should be noted that accommodating persons in EROCs for a period of time is considered to be good practice as it allows for a period of acclimatisation, de-stressing and on-site processing.  It is also a process that is supported by the UNHCR as best practice.</p>  <p>  By law all children resident in the State must attend school between the ages of 6 and 16. The children of those staying in the Ballaghaderreen EROC will be no different.  IRPP officials are liaising with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills to ensure all children of school-going age resident in the centre are either placed in an appropriate school in the general area or whether facilities in the EROC are the most appropriate mechanism to address educational needs.  It is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills to determine whether or not additional resources (e.g. SNAs) will need to be put in place in local schools to meet requirements.  If necessary, a bus service will be established should any of the school placements be outside walking distance. The availability of cr&egrave;che/pre-school facilities is also subject to discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the local service demands generated by the refugees and asylum seekers can be met, an EROC team composed of local service providers is being established.  This model works extremely well in both of the current EROCs located in Clonea Strand and Monasterevin respectively.  Persons arriving under relocation will also have had the benefit of direct engagement with my officials while in Greece or Italy, including a vulnerability/needs assessment.  Officials of the IRPP will continue to closely engage with those placed in the EROC and will work to ensure that any local service issues that may arise are promptly resolved.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. To make this a reality for all the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that have been recruited by the end of 2016 since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign of 2016, again received a strong response. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 41 to the Louth Division. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which when taking account of projected retirements will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Garda Reserve, some 1,500 Reserves will require to be recruited over the next 5 years in order to achieve the medium term target of 2,000. The Commissioner is currently developing a recruitment and training plan to recruit 300 this year and annually thereafter.  In the case of civilians the Government has approved a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021 which equates to an increase in the number of civilians from approximately 2,000 at present to 4,000. This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently at 14% civilians, more in line with international norms. The target is to be achieved through the implementation of a combination of redeployment of Garda&iacute; assigned to technical/administrative tasks to front-line policing duties and &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policies. This latter policy refers to the Commissioner adopting a default position in relation to new posts that are not on their face operational policing posts.   </p>  <p>  As I have said funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided in Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  The distribution of those recruited across the three personnel strands will be a matter for the Commissioner but undoubtedly all Divisions and Garda activities will benefit from the very substantial uplift in resources coming on stream this year and over the next number of years. </p></reply>

Nevertheless, the serious threat that criminal activity of this kind poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised, and action against it has accordingly been a priority for Revenue over recent years.</p><p>Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, including the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls underpinning a rigorous programme of enforcement action and supported by a range of new legislative measures that I brought forward in Finance Acts. In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.</p><p>Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity. </p><p>This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up earlier this year, in the framework of &quot;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&quot;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts. Under the aegis of this Task Force, a very successful joint initiative between Revenue and HMRC, directed against suspicious movements of substitute fuel with potential for considerable excise and VAT fraud, won the &quot;Outstanding Collaboration&quot; category at the UK Government Counter Fraud Awards in September 2016. This award, from Revenue's perspective, recognises the excellent work and collaboration between Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs on investigations into the illegal movement of suspected substitute fuels. </p><p>Revenue also works in close cooperation also with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.</p><p>I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing fuel laundering in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years.  An analysis of long term consumption trends for road diesel and marked diesel in Ireland undertaken by Revenue and published on their website at also points to a significant change in the pattern of consumption following implementation of the measures referred to above.  </p><p>The Deputies may also be interested to note that in an intelligence-led operation in December 2016, Revenue enforcement officers supported by the Garda Regional Support Unit, seized two oil tankers, 20,000 litres of laundered mineral oil, 140 bags of bleaching earth, ancillary equipment associated with oil laundering and cash, bank drafts and cheques in excess of &euro;60,000 in the Castleblayney area. This is the first oil laundry detected in this jurisdiction since 2014. </p><p>The penalties for offences relating to fuel fraud are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 200 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999. On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both. Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both. In addition, for an indictable offence under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, if the value of the fuel concerned in the fraud exceeds &euro;250,000, including duty and taxes, the court may impose a penalty of three times the value of the fuel, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both. The current levels of fines were introduced by the Finance Act 2010 and represented significant increases over the previous amounts: for example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.</p><p>The Courts decide on the amount of the fine to be imposed in any particular case and, in practice, do not apply fines up to the existing limits. There are no proposals at present to increase the level of fines available to the courts. However, the position is kept under review taking account, among other considerations, of the practical experience of the fines imposed under the current provisions.</p><p>I am satisfied that Revenue's work against fuel laundering has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action against fuel fraud will continue to be a high priority.</p></reply>

Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company and therefore, the Setanta liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.  As of 31 December 2016, the number of open claims is 1,664.  The Department of Finance continue to liaise with the liquidator.</p><p>Progress in the liquidation has been delayed due to court proceedings in the case of Law Society of Ireland v the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI).  The current position is that we are awaiting the outcome of MIBI's appeal to the High Court ruling, which was heard before the Supreme Court in October 2016.  </p><p>A small number of additional claims are not affected by the court proceedings and are being processed by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice. In this regard, the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has recently been able to make 65% payments totalling &euro;608,085 on 1<sup>st</sup>party claims made by Setanta policyholders for comprehensive insurance claims.  These payments are possible as they are 1<sup>st</sup>party claims which come within the ICF remit, rather than 3<sup>rd</sup>party claims delayed by the Supreme Court proceedings.  The position in relation to 3<sup>rd</sup>party motor insurance claims is that they are unlikely to be processed until after the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal. </p><p>The Liquidator for Setanta has informed me that:</p><p>- Claims provision required stands at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million</p><p>- Setanta policies were cancelled in May 2014. The 2 years allowable under the statute of limitation to lodge claims has expired so the claims figures will not increase further</p><p>- The Liquidator reports that it is proving difficult to settle claims in advance of the outcome of the MIBI appeal</p><p>- The Liquidator continues to be of the view that he will not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims</p><p>I expect to be able to provide a more accurate update after the legal proceedings are concluded. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the 'Help to Buy' initiative was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness'.  This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current crisis, of which the Help to Buy initiative is one. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the scheme is not a broad based relief available for the purchase of any home by any buyer.  It is instead a targeted response that is aimed at first-time buyers, buying (or building) new residences.  This targeting is designed to help encourage the building of new homes, thereby increasing supply, by turning notional demand into real demand.  By restricting this initiative solely to new dwellings and new self builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes should encourage the construction industry to provide for an additional supply of such properties.</p>  <p>  If the initiative was also available for second hand properties, it would have little or no effect on the provision of additional supply, and thus the scheme would consist primarily of deadweight in terms of incentive effect.  As the Deputy will be aware, an increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current crisis.</p></reply>

Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.</p>  <p>  Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,076 full-time equivalents at the start of 2011 to 5,647 at end 2014, they are currently at 5,976.  Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities has been maintained at around 2,000 during this period.  I have supported Revenue's case for an increase in staff resources which has seen their allocation increased over the past three budgets, primarily in respect of compliance resources.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to ensuring that enforcement work generally, and action against fuel fraud specifically, will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the serious threat that fuel fraud poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised, and that action against criminal activity of this kind is, and will continue to be, a central element of its work.</p>  <p>  Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, including the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls underpinning a rigorous programme of enforcement action and supported by a range of new legislative measures that I brought forward in Finance Acts over recent years.  In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from April 2015.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue works with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  I believe that this work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up last year, in the framework of "A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan" of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue.</p>  <p>  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.</p>  <p>  An analysis of the fuel market undertaken by Revenue in 2015 indicates that the wide-ranging programmes of action taken against fuel fraud have had a significant impact on illegal activity.  This is borne out by feedback from fuel traders and their representative bodies, who report a significant reduction in the incidence of laundered fuel.  In addition, Revenue carried out an extensive random sampling programme early in 2016 which tested for the presence of the new fuel marker in the storage tanks of forecourt fuel retailers.  No samples tested positive for the new fuel marker.</p>  <p>  I consider that Revenue's action against fuel fraud has had considerable success, and I am assured that action against criminal activity of that kind will continue to be a high priority.</p></reply>

The Bank has prescribed Inquiry Guidelines in order to set out the general procedure which it ordinarily proposes to follow at an ASP Inquiry (available here:). </p><p>While the Inquiry Members decide in each case how an Inquiry will proceed and the procedures to be followed, the Guidelines provide as follows:</p><p><b>Section 3.2</b>&quot;Inquiry hearings (including any Inquiry management meetings) will usually be held in public. An Inquiry hearing may only be held in private (or part in private) in the following circumstances:</p><p>- by agreement: the Inquiry and the regulated entity agree that the Inquiry should be held in private (or part in private); or </p><p>- by decision of the Inquiry: the Inquiry decides that the Inquiry shall be held in private (or part in private) being satisfied that:</p><p>(a) evidence may be given, or a matter may arise during the Inquiry that is of a confidential nature or relates to the commission, or the alleged or suspected commission, of an offence against a law of the State, or</p><p>(b) a person's reputation would be unfairly prejudiced.&quot;</p><p><b>Section 3.3</b>&quot;A notice will appear on the Central Bank website advising of the time and location of the Inquiry hearing.  The public and media will be able to watch and listen to the proceedings in a public gallery located within the Inquiry Room or adjacent to it.&quot;</p><p><b>Section 3.4</b>&quot;If the Inquiry hearing or part of the Inquiry hearing is to be held in private a Notice will appear on the Central Bank's website outlining the fact that an Inquiry hearing is commencing which is being held in private, or is being conducted in part in private, unless the Inquiry Members direct otherwise based on the considerations outlined in paragraph 3.2.&quot;</p><p>Notices are published on the Central Bank website on the details of any impending inquiry hearings.</p><p>In relation to publication of findings:</p><p><b>Section 5.20</b>&quot;Generally, the Central Bank's obligations to publish the findings of an Inquiry are set out in section 33BC of the Act.  Pursuant to section 33BC of the Act, where the Inquiry Members have found that a regulated entity is committing or has committed a prescribed contravention and/or the Inquiry Members have imposed a sanction, the Central Bank must, subject to paragraph 5.21, publish in such form and manner as it considers appropriate the Inquiry Members' findings and such (if any) of the particulars of the contravention(s) as it thinks appropriate, which will ordinarily include:</p><p>(a) the name of the regulated entity on whom a sanction has been imposed; </p><p>(b) details of the prescribed contravention(s) in respect of which the sanction has been imposed; </p><p>(c) details of the sanction imposed; and </p><p>(d) the grounds on which the finding is based.&quot; </p><p><b>Section 5.21</b>&quot;Notwithstanding this, the Central Bank is not required to publish a finding or particulars:</p><p>if publication of the finding or particulars involves the disclosure of confidential information the disclosure of which is prohibited by the 'Rome Treaty'; the ECSB Statute or the Supervisory Directives (within the meaning of section 33AK(10) of the Act); or</p><p>if the Inquiry Members determine: </p><p>(i) that the finding or particulars are of a confidential nature or relate to the commission of an offence against a law of the State; or </p><p>(ii) that publication of the finding or particulars would unfairly prejudice a person's reputation.&quot;</p><p><b>Section 5.23</b>&quot;Separate to the publication of the Inquiry Members' findings, the Central Bank may issue a market commentary on the outcome of the Inquiry, which will outline the Central Bank's view of how the findings in the case apply more broadly to the market at issue.&quot;</p><p><b>Section 5.24</b>&quot;The Central Bank will publish annually, in summary form, information on its actions under Part IIIC of the Act, including on the decisions of any Inquiry conducted.&quot;</p><p>As the Inquiry in question is ongoing, the Central Bank is not commenting at this stage on the publication of the results of the Inquiry nor on costs incurred in relation to the Inquiry.</p><p>On the particular issue of the possible penalties or sanctions that may arise from the findings of the Inquiry, the statutory position is as follows.</p><p>If an Inquiry makes a finding that a person concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider is participating or has participated in the commission by the financial service provider of a prescribed contravention, the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended) under section 33AQ provides that it may impose on the person one or more of the following sanctions:</p><p>&quot;(5) a) a caution or reprimand;</p><p>b) a direction to pay to the Central Bank a monetary penalty not exceeding the prescribed amount;</p><p>c) a direction disqualifying the person from being concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider for such period as is specified in the order;</p><p>d) if the person is found to be still participating in the commission of the contravention, a direction ordering the person to cease participating in the commission of the contravention;</p><p>e) a direction to pay to the Central Bank all or a specified part of the costs incurred by that Authority in holding the inquiry and in investigating the matter to which the inquiry relates.</p><p>(6) For the purpose of subsection (5)(b), the prescribed amount is-</p><p>a) &euro;1,000,000, or</p><p>b) if the regulations prescribe some other amount of money for paragraph (a), that other amount.&quot;</p><p>As the Inquiry in question is ongoing, the Central Bank cannot comment at this stage on the possible findings of the Inquiry.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct and Regulations, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation.  Relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016.  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expect that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged. </p></reply>

The circumstances provided for in this section include where there is a computational error in a tax assessment or where a tax assessment does not properly reflect the facts disclosed in a tax return.

Where the provision of guest accommodation is occasional in nature, as distinct from it arising in the course of a B&amp;amp;B or Guesthouse trade, the income arising would be treated as miscellaneous income (taxable under Case IV of Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997).  I am satisfied that the regime for the taxation of such income is clear and my Department is not engaged in a specific review of this area.</p><p>Regarding the VAT treatment of payments related to the provision of short term guest or holiday accommodation, a person must register for VAT if his/her income exceeds, or is likely to exceed, &euro;37,500 per annum and the applicable VAT rate in these cases is 9%.  </p><p>I am informed by Revenue that, under self-assessment rules, a person has an obligation to submit an annual tax return showing his or her taxable income from all sources (including rental income) and pay the tax due on that taxable income.  </p><p>PAYE taxpayers who have also received profit income from the provision of rooms through online accommodation sites, come under the self-assessment system and, therefore, have an obligation to make an annual tax return showing all of their sources of income and to pay the tax due on that income.</p><p>In certain circumstances, PAYE taxpayers (excluding certain company directors) whose combined taxable profit from their non-PAYE income is less than &euro;5,000 per annum may elect to pay the tax due on such taxable profit through the PAYE system; this is done by way of reducing their personal tax credits.  Where the tax due on all such income has been collected through the PAYE system for a tax year, a PAYE taxpayer must complete a tax return for that tax year only when requested to so by a Revenue officer.</p><p>I am further informed that information or statistics on the amount of income declared from individual sources is not available.</p><p>By virtue of section 888 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, intermediaries who receive payments from third parties on behalf of certain other persons, where those payments are made in connection with a premises, are obliged to provide an annual return to Revenue.  The legislation provides that the annual return should set out the amount of payments received, the name and address of the person to whom the premises belongs as well as the address of the premises in respect of which the payments were made.  </p><p>On account of the confidentiality provisions contained in section 851A TCA 1997, the Commissioners are precluded from providing any specific information in relation to compliance with the third party return obligations as set out in section 888 TCA 1997.  However, where the Commissioners receive annual third party returns from payment intermediaries, these returns are extensively analysed to ensure that the details provided are fully and accurately matched to specific individual taxpayers and to confirm whether the payment details provided by the third party have been fully declared by the ultimate recipient of the payment.</p><p>It is assumed that recipients of income reported by third party sources have declared the relevant details to Revenue for the years 2014 and 2015.  However, where a taxpayer has not declared such income, I strongly recommend that they do so immediately as continued non-compliance can become costly due to the possible application of interest and penalties on any outstanding tax amounts.</p><p>Where a taxpayer has already filed their 2015 tax return but has not declared profit income from sources referred to by the Deputy, or similar sources, under the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions - - a taxpayer may self-correct their tax return without incurring penalties, provided they correct the tax return by 31 October 2017.  It should be noted that interest on any outstanding tax amount will still be payable and will continue to accumulate until the outstanding amount is paid and therefore I strongly encourage taxpayers to make any necessary self-corrections as soon as possible.</p><p>For taxpayers who have not yet filed a tax return or have not declared relevant income Revenue, they should write to their local Revenue office, setting out details of any income received and related expenses for the years 2014 and 2015, as appropriate.</p></reply>

When filing the LPT return the individual claimed the 'unfinished housing estate' exemption even though the estate in which the property is located is not included in the 'prescribed list'.  On that basis the property is not entitled to the exemption and the individual  is liable to pay LPT for years 2013 to 2017 inclusive.</p>  <p>  Revenue has already advised the individual of the situation and has made them aware of the various payment options including phased payment arrangements that are available to them.

In 2016 annual inflation in Ireland, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), averaged -0.2 per cent over the year to November and is expected to be slightly negative on average for the year as a whole.  </p>  <p>  However, in Ireland and in the euro area, there are emerging signs that inflation is starting to pick-up gradually as the drag on consumer prices from low oil prices has eased.  However, the recent euro-sterling appreciation is exerting downward pressure on consumer prices domestically as the UK accounts for a large proportion of imported consumer goods.  </p>  <p>  Looking forward, futures markets for oil are suggesting a further gradual recovery in oil prices over the course of 2017.  In addition, the continued growth in domestic demand and the ongoing recovery in the labour market are expected to lead to further services price inflation.  Taking all these factors into account, price pressures will likely rise gradually but remain subdued into 2017.  In Budget 2017, published in October 2016, my Department forecast HICP annual inflation of 1.3 per cent for 2017.  My Department will update its inflation forecasts with the publication of the Stability Programme Update in April of this year.</p></reply>

This publication provides details of arrears in banks and non bank entities.  However the data is not published in the format requested by the Deputy.  The latest release is available here: </p><p>I would also refer the Deputy to the Central Bank's Report on Mortgage Arrears, published on 16 December at .  In this report the Central Bank concludes that there is a broad range of available restructures offered and delivered by banks and non-bank entities.  Furthermore, the Central Bank notes that there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process.  Section 4.3 of this report comments on legal proceedings and notes that non-bank entities accounted for 17% of the total stock of repossessed PDH properties in possession as of end-June 2016, with banks accounting for the remaining 83%.  The proportion of legal proceedings that result in an order for possession is higher among the non-bank entities.  The Central Bank notes that this possibly reflects the higher volume of accounts in deep distress among these entities.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans. </p><p>Finally, it is clear from the most recent Central Bank data on mortgage restructures that where a borrower actively engages with their lender under the CCMA with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home.  The new Abhaile mortgage resolution service, which can be accessed through the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service (MABS) helpline, can provide access to independent financial and legal advice at no cost to individual borrowers.</p></reply>

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including through the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme study published in November 2015 titled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'.  This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Following the result of the UK referendum and to prepare for the forthcoming negotiations, work has been intensified across the whole of Government level including in my own Department.  A new Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division  was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit.  In addition, the Department published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy.  More recently, the Department has worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report titled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published in November 2016. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to support any opportunities that might arise.  These include measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agri-food and Irish exporters.  These measures are an important first step in mitigating the impacts on the Irish economy from the economic implications of Brexit.  More information on these measures is available in the Budget documentation.</p>  <p>  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, Budget 2017 signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer. </p>  <p>  The work being done by the Department, including the work of Minister of State Murphy T.D. who has responsibility for Financial Services, will be an important input to ensuring that Ireland will be in a position to counter any negative economic impact arising from Brexit and to ensure that Ireland's  interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.  The Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts, to carry out relevant analysis and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context.</p></reply>

It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  In this regard, we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the strengthening of the euro against sterling last year.  Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future. Indeed, the drag on consumer prices from low oil prices is already beginning to ease. </p><p>In addition, excessive rent and house price growth are also a potential threat to competitiveness.  In this regard, the Government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at tackling supply constraints which should ease price pressures.</p><p>Sustainable fiscal policies, to which the Government is committed, are also a key driver of competitiveness. </p><p>Finally, it is also important that, at firm level, pay moves in line with productivity developments. </p><p>In summary, I am highly conscious of the need to maintain competitiveness-oriented policies in order to help address emerging uncertainties.</p></reply>

This follows annual growth of 3.1 per cent in the second quarter. </p><p>While the strong growth in the third quarter was driven by net exports, overall the recovery is now being increasingly driven by domestic demand with strong contributions from both consumption and investment spending.  Indeed, personal consumption is up 3.2 per cent in the first three quarters of this year on an annual basis. </p><p>The economic recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market.  Employment grew by 2.9 per cent (+57,500) over the year to Q3 2016, the sixteenth successive quarter of employment growth.  The increase in employment remains broad based with gains recorded in 12 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.</p><p>Recent data published indicate that:</p><p>- The volume of retail sales increased by 4.3 per cent year-on-year in November 2016.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up by 4.9 per cent over the same period. </p><p>- New cars licensed for the first time were up 17.8 per cent in 2016 compared to 2015.</p><p>- Expansion in the construction sector continued in November with the Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector recording its thirty-ninth successive month of expansion. </p><p>- The Consumer Sentiment Index was 96.2 in December, well above its long run average. </p><p>- The seasonally-adjusted monthly unemployment rate for December was 7.2 per cent, down from 8.9 per cent in December 2015.  As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by more than half since its peak of over 15 per cent in early-2012.</p><p>However, there are several sources of uncertainty at present including the UK's decision to exit the EU.  The sharp depreciation of sterling is the most significant short-term impact arising from Brexit.  While the euro-sterling exchange rate has moderated from the post referendum peak of &euro;1 = &pound;0.90, it remains particularly volatile increasing to almost &euro;1 = &pound;0.87 in recent trading, representing a 13 per cent appreciation since the UK vote.  This poses significant challenges, particularly for parts of the exporting sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade.</p><p>In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding the change in administration in Washington, including the extent to which US economic policy will shift towards protectionism. </p><p>These sources of uncertainty highlight the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p><p>In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain stable although the full impact of Brexit is yet to be seen.  I am also conscious that the level of uncertainty regarding international developments is very high.  In this regard, it is critical that appropriate polices are implemented in Ireland and that is what the Government is doing and will continue to do.</p></reply>

Domestic demand is driving growth once again with strong contributions from both consumption and investment spending, while underlying exports are holding up despite the sharp depreciation of sterling throughout 2016.  Service exports in particular remain strong with double-digit growth recorded in the third quarter of 2016 year on year.</p>  <p>  According to the European Commission, Ireland is also expected to be among the fastest growing economies in Europe this year.  The European Commission expects Ireland's economy to grow by 3.6 per cent in 2017 compared with growth of 1.6 per cent for the EU and 1.5 per cent for the euro area. </p>  <p>  The Government's priority is to ensure continued, sustainable economic growth in order to further increase living standards and reduce unemployment.</p></reply>

For example, it has asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  Also the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would help boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  In particular, the Programme for Government considers that the development of a code of conduct for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiative which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.  As the Deputy will be aware, research carried out by the Central Bank last year indicated that a significant number of borrowers could make savings by switching mortgages.  Therefore, in order to promote the option of switching mortgages, I have also asked the Central Bank to consider and formulate a code in this area and in response the Central Bank has indicated that it has commenced a programme of research on this topic to inform its consideration of this matter.</p><p>More immediately, it should be noted that the Central Bank is introducing some further protections for variable rate mortgage holders.  The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an , and effective from 1 February, will require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.  The measures will also improve the level of information to be provided to borrowers about other mortgage products their lender provides that could provide savings for the borrower and signpost borrowers to the CCPC's mortgage switching tool. </p><p>It is important also to take account of the diversity of the residential mortgage market which comprises, inter alia, fixed interest rate, loan to value managed variable rate mortgages, trackers, restructured mortgages of various types, etc.  Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed by only looking at standard variable rate mortgages, and any assessment would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing.</p><p>Overall, the Government is of the opinion that real competition among lenders is the best way to ensure that retail mortgage lending rates are further reduced in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for new mortgage lending.  This is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in its ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the mortgage query tool, which is an integral part of the system for mortgage providers, went live last week. </p><p>I am also advised that the number of Help To Buy applications received up to Friday 13 January 2017 was:<table><tr><th>No. of Applications</th><th>Successful applications</th><th>*Pending</th></tr><tr><td>1,255</td><td>132</td><td>1,123</td></tr></table>*Pending means that the applicants either have to file an outstanding return or address a compliance issue, the application is to be reviewed by a Revenue caseworker or the applicant needs to finalise his or her application.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy's request for the breakdown of applications by different loan-to-value ratios, the Revenue Commissioners advise this is not available.  Information about the loan-to-value ratios is available from the finalised claim submitted by successful applicants and it is not available at the application stage.  To date, a small number of claims have been paid and that number is not a sufficiently large sample to enable Revenue to provide the categorisation sought.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners are encouraging prospective applicants to file any necessary returns and resolve any outstanding issues before they make their HTB application.  I am aware that HTB applicants can also use Revenue's website to carry out other requests, for example to file a Form 12 or apply for tax clearance.  PAYE taxpayers can use myAccount and the bulk of the applications so far have been submitted via myAccount.  Business taxpayers can use ROS Revenue's Online Service. </p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have seen a very healthy level of interest in the HTB scheme, which is indicated by the level of applications already received and by the activity on their website since the scheme was announced last October.  I am further advised that the level of interest in the Scheme has been consistently increasing since the start of the year.</p><p>Another element of the Scheme is that first time purchasers of property after 1 January this year are required to ensure that they purchase from a 'qualified contractor'.  The Revenue Commissioners have already approved 5 contractors, and up to Friday 13 January 2017 there were 37 applications for registration as 'qualified contractors'.  Given the number of queries from contractors, Revenue anticipates that the number of approved contractors will increase significantly over the next few weeks.</p></reply>

These rules were also given domestic legal effect through the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 following the passage of a constitutional referendum in May 2012 in which the Irish people supported accession to the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. </p>  <p>  The rules are designed to ensure that increases in public expenditure are sustainably financed and do not rely on cyclical or windfall revenues.  The deteriorating international outlook illustrates the need for caution and prudent economic and fiscal policies. </p>  <p>  These rules do not per se limit public spending.  They do, however, require that any additional spending is financed through sustainable revenue raising measures.  This is not unreasonable.</p>  <p>  For this reason I would not support efforts to exclude areas of permanent recurring expenditure such as defence spending from the assessment of compliance with the SGP, as such an approach could undermine fiscal sustainability in the relevant Member States.  Having said that, it is important to note that there is existing flexibility within the fiscal rules that is designed to promote public investment in vital capital infrastructure, and I am supportive of greater flexibility in this area.</p></reply>

Consequently, I cannot require companies to price insurance for older cars in a particular  way. </p>  <p>  In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, motor insurers use a combination of rating factors.  The age of the car can be one of these factors, in addition to the age of the driver, the type of car, the claims record, driving experience, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors and as a result prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose accordingly.  In addition, insurers price in accordance with their own past claims experience; for example, where the age of a car is a factor, different insurance companies would use different age thresholds. </p>  <p>   Policy in relation to the NCT lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The NCT was introduced to comply with an EU Roadworthiness Testing Directive aimed at improving road safety and environmental protection.  The NCT is an inspection or general "health check" of what is visible and accessible on the day of the test and includes a check of the roadworthiness of such safety features, amongst others, as lighting, brakes and tyres.  It goes beyond the current Directive's requirements in many areas and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is of the view that the Irish system is one of the best roadworthiness testing regimes in the EU.  While the NCT is one component of having safer vehicles on our roads, every vehicle owner has a personal and legal responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy and well maintained.</p></reply>

Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.  Each of these was increased in the most recent budget, Budget 2017.</p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;310,000 (formerly &euro;280,000) </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;32,500 (formerly &euro;30,150) </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;16,250 (formerly &euro;15,075) </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>In 2015 the Group A CAT threshold, applying to transfers from parents to their children, was &euro;225,000.  I raised it to &euro;280,000 in Budget 2016 and further increased it to &euro;310,000 in Budget 2017.  This represents an increase of about 38% in two years.

For example, Revenue uses data it receives from the Department of Social Protection in relation to child benefit, together with other data from Revenue's own records, to automatically grant the credit each year.  In 2015, I am advised that Revenue gave the relief automatically to approximately 81,000 taxpayers on this basis.  Revenue also pre-populates the annual tax returns of self-assessed taxpayers with the Home Carer Tax Credit where it was claimed in the previous year.</p><p>Where the credit has not been granted automatically, a claim for the Home Carer Credit may be made by the individual either by claiming it on-line via the Revenue website, by completing a claim form or in the person's annual tax return.  Revenue information leaflet IT 66 provides full details of the credit .</p><p>The most recent year for which figures are available is 2014, in which year the maximum value of home carer tax credit available was &euro;810, and the overall cost to the Exchequer was an estimated &euro;60.9 million, in respect of 80,900 recipients.

They do not include the number of potential claimants whose entitlement to other tax credits was sufficient to reduce their tax liability to nil without reference to the home carer tax credit.

This protocol is required to be in place by the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  Further, by Q2 2017, insurers are being asked to implement procedures to enable the acceptance of driver experience from abroad when a person has previous driving experience in Ireland and is coming from a country that drives on the left side of road and to take full account of the experience in that country and previous experience in Ireland when pricing a policy.  By Q4 2017, insurers are being asked to implement a similar procedure in relation to experience gained in a country that drives on the right hand side of the road.  Insurance Ireland will submit a report to the Department of Finance on the implementation of these procedures in Q2 and Q4 2017.   </p></reply>

As you are aware, this review was carried out jointly by the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the report was approved by Government on 19 July.  Since the publication of the report, work has commenced on the implementation of a number of its recommendations, including amendments to the Insurance Acts.  The necessary consultations with various stakeholders, including industry are ongoing.  It is expected that a legislative proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Some of the key recommendations contained in the report are:   </p>  <p>  - That coverage of the Insurance Compensation Fund will be extended to include third party motor insurance claims in the event of a liquidation of an insurer.  The level of cover from the Insurance Compensation Fund for third party motor insurance claims will be increased from 65% to 100% in line with that currently provided by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.</p>  <p>  - The increased coverage of the Insurance Compensation Fund will be funded by a direct contribution to the Insurance Compensation Fund from the motor insurance industry.  While the Review indicated that this would come via the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, to the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims, further discussions are ongoing with industry about options for alternative funding arrangements which would provide greater  predictability about their financial exposure.</p>  <p>  This report when implemented will provide greater certainty in relation to the operation of the insurance compensation framework and it should ensure speedier payments and a simplification of the claims procedure.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been prepared by the Pyrite Resolution Board (PRB) under the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013.  The intent behind the Deputy's question is unclear, as presumably the affected homes are already principle private residences for their owners.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy incentive is not aimed at the rebuilding or restoration of existing dwellings, but instead is restricted to the purchase of new dwellings and new self-builds.  By restricting the incentive in this way, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new-build homes should encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.  The initiative specifically excludes properties that have previously been occupied as a dwelling.</p>  <p>  A property previously occupied and subject to remedial works under the Pyrite Remediation scheme would not be considered as a new build under the scheme.  If this were to be permitted, then an argument could also be made for other dwellings which have been restored or rebuilt to also qualify.  This would open the scheme up to second hand properties, and would undermine one of the key reasons, i.e. to increase the supply of new housing, for the Help to Buy initiative.</p></reply>

As such the households in the top or bottom 10% of the distribution in 2007 are not necessarily the same households who are in the top or bottom 10% of the distribution in 2014. </p>  <p>  Updated data that includes the gross labour income of workers and self-employed persons for 2015 will be made available as part of the 2015 EU SILC release which is expected in the first quarter of this year, while data for 2016 is expected to be available with the 2016 release, due in the first quarter of 2018.</p>  <p>  The gross labour income data referenced by the Deputy does not take account of the impact of the tax or transfer system or other components of disposable income.  The OECD IDD database also presents data on household disposable income which is arguably a more appropriate metric for comparing movements in income over time.  For Ireland, this data shows a more modest decline of 14% in household disposable income for the bottom 10% of households and a decrease of 9% for the top 10% of households between 2007 and 2014.</p>  <p>  The OECD data shows a significant decrease in the gross labour income earned by households in the bottom 10% of the household income distribution in Ireland between 2007 and 2014.  This reflects, in part, the increase in the number of households with low or very low work intensity - so called "jobless households" - between 2007 and 2014. </p>  <p>  A number of other countries also experienced significant reductions in the gross labour income earned by households in the bottom 10% of the household income distribution.  Although not shown in the chart supplied by the Deputy, larger decreases are seen in data for Spain (69%), Greece (67%) and Portugal (57%), although again this does not take account of taxes and transfers in these countries.</p></reply>

However, it is important to view these receipts in conjunction with the overall corporation tax receipts for 2016, which were very strong.  Corporation tax receipts closed 2016 &euro;737 million or 11.1 per cent above target, representing an annual increase of 7.0 per cent.  In relation to the under-performance in December, a contributing factor was a large repayment of c. &euro;150 million, scheduled for October 2016, which was delayed and subsequently paid in December.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, corporation tax refunds and one-off payments are a normal feature of our tax system, which subsequently increases the difficulty in forecasting this tax-head.  While my Department liaises very closely with Revenue's Large Cases Division, which plays a key role in formulating forecasts, corporation tax remains difficult to forecast, due to various company specific and other idiosyncratic reasons.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a company may be entitled to a refund of corporation tax paid.  For example, large companies are required to make preliminary tax payments in the sixth and eleventh months of their accounting period.  The preliminary tax payments are determined either with reference to the company's liability in the previous accounting period, or based on the anticipated liability of the current accounting period.  The actual liability, determined after the end of the accounting period, may be lower than the preliminary tax payments thus resulting in an overpayment of tax.  This could occur where a company's profits are lower than initially forecast.</p><p>Secondly, sections 766 and 766A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide for a tax credit in respect of qualifying expenditure on Research &amp;amp; Development (R&amp;amp;D).  The R&amp;amp;D tax credit must be initially used to reduce the corporation tax liability of the company for the accounting period in which the relevant expenditure is incurred.  Any unused amount may be carried forward and used to reduce the corporation tax liability of subsequent accounting periods.  However, where an excess remains, instead of carrying forward that excess, a company may claim to use it to reduce the corporation tax liability of the preceding accounting period.  If any excess still remains it may still be carried forward and used to reduce the corporation tax liability of succeeding accounting periods.  In the event that there is no corporation tax liability in the current year, the company may claim to have the amount of that excess paid to them by the Revenue Commissioners in 3 instalments over a period of 33 months from the end of the accounting period in which the expenditure was incurred.</p><p>Thirdly, where a company incurs a trading loss, section 396A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, allows for this loss to be carried back to the previous accounting period.  As the company would have already paid its liability for the earlier accounting period, such a situation would result in the company being entitled to a refund in respect of that loss.</p><p>Finally, circumstances such as company restructurings, mergers and acquisitions, as well disposals of subsidies, amongst others, can result in changes to corporation tax liabilities.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that higher-than-profiled repayments in December contributed to the shortfall in corporation tax receipts in that month.  For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, Revenue is unable to provide further details.  However, it should be noted that, as outlined above, repayments are a normal part of the functioning of the tax system and occur throughout the year.  As indicated in their report on Corporation Tax receipts in 2015, <i></i>, repayments of Corporation Tax totalled around &euro;800 million in 2015 and levels are expected to be similar in 2016.  Revenue will publish a detailed 2016 analysis in due course.</p></reply>

Under the Irish corporate tax system, losses incurred in the course of a business are allowed to be taken into account in calculating the appropriate amount of tax due by companies.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over a longer period than just a single year and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not allow loss relief in the next.  </p>  <p>  Under existing loss relief provisions in the Tax Acts, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for offset against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods.  Alternatively, a company may claim to have the loss set off against profits of any description for the same accounting period in which the loss was incurred or of an immediately preceding accounting period of the same length.</p>  <p>  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and of all other OECD countries. </p></reply>

In our formal submission to Brazil we highlighted that Ireland also has a 25% corporation tax rate on passive income and a 33% rate on chargeable gains.  We also stressed that the 12.5% rate has been settled policy in Ireland since 2003.  Ireland's corporation tax take has also typically been very close to the EU and OECD averages both in terms of corporate tax as a percentage of GDP and in terms corporate tax as a percentage of total tax revenue.  We believe it is inappropriate to include Ireland on a black list simply because we apply a low tax rate to a wide tax base which is fully in line with recommended OECD best practice.</p>  <p>  Our technical  delegation will outline this view to the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service and seek to fully explain our corporate tax system.

The Report was approved by the Government on 10 January 2017 and subsequently published.  The Report contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions are detailed in an action plan with agreed timelines for implementation, covering six main themes:</p><p>- Protecting the consumer</p><p>- Improving data availability  </p><p>- Improving the personal injuries claims environment</p><p>- Reducing the costs in the claims process</p><p>- Reducing insurance fraud and uninsured driving, and</p><p>- Promoting road safety and reducing collisions</p><p>The recommendations include actions to:</p><p>- address the lack of transparency in the claims environment, through the establishment of a national claims information database which will be located in the Central Bank;</p><p>- provide enhanced guidance in how to determine compensation for personal injuries claims, through the establishment of a Personal Injuries Commission;</p><p>- address the increasing level of uninsured driving, through the establishment of a fully functioning database which will allow the Garda&iacute; to check insurance compliance through the use of technology such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition; and</p><p>- address the issue of suspected fraud, through the establishment of a database that will be funded by industry but held by an independent body and that will take into account data protection concerns. </p><p>A number of the actions are already underway and I am confident that the report's 71 actions will be implemented by the end of 2018, with 45 due for completion this year.</p><p>While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, cooperation and commitment between all parties can deliver fairer premiums for consumers without unnecessary delay.  This will lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and will help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past.  It should also better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.</p><p>The Working Group will continue to meet in 2017 as the project enters its implementation phase.</p><p>The Deputy should note that the Book of Quantum was most recently revised and published in 2016.  In addition, and as part of the implementation of the Report, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are tasked with exploring with the Judiciary how future reviews of the Book of Quantum might involve appropriate judicial involvement in its compilation or adoption, introducing more granularity into the Book of Quantum and updating it every 3 years at a minimum.</p></reply>

In line with its statutory mandate, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is examining opportunities to make, on a commercial basis, strategic investments that have the potential to support increased social housing output.</p>  <p>  In the private market, the Fund is already involved in a number of important initiatives which cumulatively can make a contribution to increased housing output.  This includes its investments in:</p>  <p>- Activate Capital - which is an innovative non-bank financing platform that has the potential to provide funding for substantial numbers of new homes in Dublin and the other major urban centres in which demand is most pronounced; </p>  <p>- Ardstone Residential Partnership - which is a residential equity investment fund that is focused on delivering residential units to the market over the short-to medium-term; and </p>  <p>- Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund - which has funded a number of residential developments in recent months.</p>  <p>  Activate Capital, which has the potential to fund the delivery of up to 11,000 new housing units over the medium term, has already advanced funding for the construction of 1,200 new houses in the greater Dublin area.  The Ardstone Fund has to date acquired sites with the potential to deliver up to 1,800 new housing units which will be delivered over a 5-7 year time frame and is targeting a total delivery of up to 3,000 new units.  The Wilbur Ross Cardinal Fund, which has a focus on multiple real estate sectors, providing both pure finance and development capital, has already advanced funding for 1,700 new residential units.</p>  <p>  In the social housing market, in line with the commitment contained in "Rebuilding Ireland" the NTMA and the key Government Departments are examining the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle in conjunction with the private sector, which could facilitate investment in social housing.  Key factors which must be addressed to facilitate ISIF involvement in such projects include: </p>  <p>  1. the commercial viability of the vehicle; and </p>  <p>  2. the off-balance sheet structure of the vehicle.   </p>  <p>  ISIF informs me that whilst it has made progress in conjunction with other stakeholders in the State and private sectors in respect of potential social housing investment opportunities, there are still considerable hurdles to be overcome before any such proposals can be brought to a successful conclusion.  The Deputy will appreciate that whilst ISIF is working closely with all relevant stakeholders to help overcome hurdles to investment in social housing, many of these hurdles are outside the control of ISIF and require strong inputs from other stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  In relation to interest rates charged by ISIF, ISIF invests on a risk adjusted basis.  In this context, the interest rates applied by ISIF to any given investment relates to the level of risk and other investment criteria, including pricing, and reflects its mandate to act commercially and in a way that contributes to the local economy. </p>  <p>  A review of ISIF's investment strategy is due to be finalised shortly.  The review includes an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to date.  The NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 provides that ownership of the Fund vests with the Minister for Finance.  It also provides that the Fund shall, in reviewing its investment strategy, consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The review of the ISIF will be conducted in accordance with these provisions.  In addition, the legislation provides that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers as appropriate.</p></reply>

Fiscal rules are all-the-more important in a monetary union, given the scope for spillovers among participating Member States.</p>  <p>  Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins and facilitates the goals of sustainability and economic growth.  Ireland's recent and continued economic recovery is testament to this. </p>  <p>  It is evidently important that rules are implemented in a fair and consistent manner and that all Member States are treated equally concerning the application of the Stability and Growth Pact.  This is essential for the continued credibility of these rules.  Any perception that the rules are not being applied in an equitable manner.</p>  <p>  In Ireland we have defended and complied with the fiscal rules through difficult times.  This defence becomes progressively more difficult if there is any suggestion that the rules are not being applied consistently, particularly when there are perceived differences between the treatment of small and large Member States.  So I would have some sympathy with the view of Chairman Dijsselbloem that unequal application could undermine confidence in the rules and, in this regard, I would reiterate that the fiscal rules must be applied in a transparent, consistent and fair manner. </p></reply>

This increased expenditure for 2015 on a one-off basis by circa &euro;2.1 billion, which built a significant buffer into the calculation of Ireland's compliance with the expenditure benchmark in 2016, thereby significantly reducing the risk of breaching the benchmark.  There is no carry-through impact from this one-off transaction on the calculation 2017 expenditure benchmark.</p>  <p>  The briefing does not raise issues in relation to potential rule breaches in 2017.   Indeed in its assessment of Ireland's Draft Budgetary Plan for 2017, the European Commission in October last year found Ireland to be broadly compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth pact (SGP).</p></reply>

The levy was charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raises approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year does not exceed &euro;100,000, the levy is not payable.</p>  <p>  In the budget statement two years ago, I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the levy.</p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department in early 2016.  Following that review, I decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.  I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect.  Firstly, it ensures that financial institutions entering the market over the five further years for which the levy will apply will be subject to the levy and financial institutions exiting the market will cease to be subject to the levy.  Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, I have to increase the rate at which the levy is charged from 35% to 59% for 2017.  This is because the assessable amount, DIRT payments in 2015, have reduced significantly since 2011. This new rate, combined with the new 2015 base year, will preserve the existing contribution of &euro;150 million paid by the affected financial institutions.  That rate will be subject to review to ensure that the yield from the levy is not impacted from changes in interest rates and/or DIRT rates. </p></reply>

My primary objective in the disposal of any AIB shares will be to maximise the return for the State in a manner that is consistent with recovering our full &euro;20.7 bn investment.</p>  <p>  The advice I have received confirms that an IPO is the optimal route to recouping value from this investment.  Officials in my Department along with our Independent Financial Advisor, Rothschild, have done considerable preparatory work in this regard.  In December of last year, following a competitive procurement process, three investment banks were appointed to act as Global Coordinators on a potential selling syndicate, in preparation for a possible IPO.  These banks have been appointed for an 18 month period and additional banks will be appointed to fill out the syndicate at an appropriate future date.</p>  <p>  I cannot predict what market conditions will be like for bank shares over the coming year, however it is our intention to be ready to execute a transaction if conditions allow.  Given the improved state of the national accounts, progress made in reducing our national debt and positive market sentiment towards Ireland, we are not under any pressure to monetise our banking investments.  As a result we have some flexibility around when we time our disposals in the market.</p>  <p>  It would not be possible or prudent for me to estimate the amount which might be received from any future sale of shares in AIB at this time.  This will depend both on the quantum of shares sold and the price arrived at in the market during the IPO process. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, all capital returned from the State's investments in the Irish banks will be used to reduce the national debt.  That is the prudent course of action as it reduces our ongoing borrowing costs and ensures the future strength and stability of the economy. </p></reply>

This is available to self-employed individuals who have an active trade or profession, and who do not have access to the PAYE credit.  This will be a significant benefit to small business-owners right across the country including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also committed to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed, and in Budget 2017 the Government announced the extension of access to Invalidity Pensions to the self-employed.  Invalidity Pension is a pension payment for people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability.  When someone develops a long-term illness it can cause serious financial repercussions.  Gaining access to Invalidity Pension will provide the self-employed with a much stronger safety net to protect them in the event of injury or disablement.  The self-employed will gain access to Invalidity Pension on the same basis as employees from December 2017.</p>  <p>  Also announced in Budget 2017, is the extension of Treatment Benefits to the self-employed on the same basis as employees.  The Treatment Benefit Scheme provides partial dental, optical and aural services to those who have made the required contributions.  This extension will come into effect from March 2017. Treatment Benefit entitlements will be extended further from October 2017, providing additional dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  In addition, jobseekers taking up self-employment will be able to access the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance after 9 months, down from 12 months.  Minister Varadkar, the Minister for Social Protection, can provide further information in respect of the above initiatives if required.</p>  <p>  I accept that differences remain between the taxation of employees and the self-employed.  However it must also be acknowledged that some of these differences are to the benefit of the self-employed.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  The self-employed also continue to benefit from a broader expense deduction regime than that available to employees. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department published an Income Tax Reform Plan, in July last year, providing a detailed overview of relevant policy considerations, including the necessity to maintain the breadth of our income tax base, and retain appropriate levels of taxation for high earners.  The taxation of the self-employed is considered in some detail in the plan, and the issues outlined therein will be borne in mind when deciding future reform of the income tax system as it relates to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this Income Tax Reform Plan was to inform all members of the Oireachtas of the issues and options which will underpin future income tax reform, and it is my hope that all members of the Oireachtas will engage constructively in debating options for future reform in this area.  In this regard the scope for change will be dependent on the level of available fiscal resources.</p></reply>

The shortcomings of the EU's harmonised methodology have been previously highlighted by my Department. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, substantial efforts have been undertaken by my Department to develop alternative models for estimating potential output for Ireland.  Significant work has also been undertaken aimed at ensuring the rigour and stability of the alternative set of estimates.  Progress on this work had been delayed by the distortions in the 2015 national accounts revisions.  The intention is to detail this work in a forthcoming Department of Finance technical paper.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this progress on the development of alternative models, the harmonised methodology remains the binding methodology in the context of EU fiscal surveillance.  However, progress also continues to be made at technical level - with participation in the relevant working group of all Member States - on improving this harmonised methodology, and Ireland continues to actively contribute on this front.  Indeed, recognising the importance of this work from an Irish perspective, the relevant working group at a European level is chaired by a senior official in my Department.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would stress that, in the assessment of the cyclical position of the economy, my Department takes into consideration a wide range of indicators, in addition to supply-side estimates.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a range of commitments in the broad housing and banking area and my Department regularly engages with the Central Bank on all the Programme for Government Commitments which will impact on the Central Bank and its role in relation to mortgages.</p><p>In this context, the Central Bank has recently produced a report on mortgage arrears following my request to the Governor.  This report provides a detailed assessment of mortgage arrears in banks and non-bank entities and includes analysis on mortgage restructuring activity and the range of solutions offered that may affect borrowers' capacity to remain in their primary residence.  This report was published on 16th December 2016 and is available on .  The report notes that progress on mortgage arrears is well established and clearly moving in the right direction.</p><p>Furthermore, the Central Bank publishes quarterly statistics on Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions.  In addition, the Central Bank's Household Credit Market Report contains data on negative equity.  The latest report is available at <i></i>and table 7 in the report presents the percentage of loans in negative equity split by default status.  The data in the Household Credit Market Report are for 2015 and do not reflect changes to loan balances and house prices since December 2015.  The Central Bank estimates that 15 per cent of PDH loans  and 26 per cent of BTL loans were in negative equity at end December 2015 of which 10 per cent of PDH and 14 per cent of BTL loans were deemed to be performing.  The numbers in negative equity have been reducing and this has important implications for the wider economy such as improving mobility amongst those affected, potential greater spend on home improvements and maintenance, and increased consumption via the wealth effect.</p></reply>

The tax will contribute towards important public health goals, as well providing a new source of revenue for public spending.  The Department of Health has also supported the introduction of a tax on SSDs in order to reduce added-sugar in diets, particularly the diets of children and young people.  The proposed tax on SSDs is seen as just one measure in the Department of Health's comprehensive plan to tackle obesity in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Sugar-sweetened drinks taxes have been introduced in a number of European countries in recent years.  The UK is due to introduce a soft-drinks industry levy from April 2018.  On Budget day I said that given the highly integrated production and supply chains which exist in the soft drinks industry between Ireland and the United Kingdom, it would be prudent to align the Irish sugar-sweetened drinks tax with the UK's tax proposal, in terms of time-frame and structure.</p>  <p>  I also launched a public consultation process on Budget day to get the views of all stakeholders in order to ensure that, when introduced, the tax is as effective as possible, as fair as possible, and minimises the administrative burden on business.  That public consultation period expired on 3 January 2017 and prompted 30 submissions from the health sector, the soft drinks industry and citizens.  Officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners are currently collating and analysing the responses which will then be taken into consideration when developing the tax, including at which point in the supply chain these products will become liable for tax. </p>  <p>  The estimated yield from the tax on SSDs will depend on the eventual design.  The General Excises Tax Strategy Group (TSG) paper 2016 examines options around an SSD tax and potential estimated yields.  Both the General Excises TSG paper and the Public Consultation paper are available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are engaged in ongoing communication with the soft drinks industry to ensure the tax, when introduced, is effective and implemented in an administratively straightforward manner.  It is expected that the underpinning legislation will be introduced in this year's Finance Act.</p></reply>

I think it is important to be clear on what the Governor said.  He said that in addition to the four primary challenges he identified in the regulatory treatment of financial innovations, technological innovation may also alter the role of central banks in managing the money supply and acting as a lender of last resort.</p>  <p>  He instanced the growth in electronic forms of payment and said that at one level this growth looks set to reduce the traditional role of notes and coins in the monetary system.  He noted that this may have implications for the role of central banks generally in managing the money supply.  He also said that, at another level, there is much discussion on the relative merits of more widespread adoption of private-sector digital currencies versus a new role for central banks in the direct issuance and management of publicly-backed digital currencies.</p>  <p>  If, in time, there is to be a new role of this kind for central banks in the Euro area, it would have to be agreed at a European level.  The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament published a report on virtual currencies in May 2016 which called for the creation of a horizontal taskforce on distributed ledger technology to be set up under the leadership of the European Commission.  The Deputy is likely to be aware that the European Commission has published proposals to amend the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive including provisions on virtual currencies and negotiations on these proposals are ongoing.</p></reply>

The immediate run-up to year-end is a period of relatively low market activity and this is the primary reason for the reduction in purchases of all government bonds including Irish government bonds in December.  </p>  <p>  In early December 2016, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank announced an extension of the APP but with a reduced overall volume of purchases from &euro;80 billion to &euro;60 billion per month.  It also announced changes in some of the parameters within which the purchase programmes operate.  The Central Bank of Ireland will manage the implementation of the APP as smoothly as possible, taking into account both the extension and the programme parameters.</p>  <p>  The term 'tapering' is normally taken to refer to a gradual stepping down of purchase volumes to zero.  It is important to clarify that the ECB's Governing Council has not indicated any tapering phase, merely an adjustment of purchase volumes.   Specifically, it has stated that the monthly pace of &euro;60 billion will continue until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.  The Governing Council has also stated that if, in the meantime, the outlook becomes less favourable or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, it intends to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration.  It is also important to note that the APP is a Eurosystem-wide purchase programme and its impact in any member state will be felt through a range of channels not just through the purchases of government bonds within the particular economy.</p></reply>

By a majority of 59 per cent to 41 per cent the referendum was defeated.  Mr Renzi has subsequently resigned and a new Prime Minster, Mr Paolo Gentiloni has been sworn in.  It is expected that Mr Gentiloni, the previous Italian Foreign Minister, can provide the required continuity as the Italian political system will inevitably need some additional time to take stock and agree a way forward.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this referendum was about internal constitutional reform in Italy, not about support for the European Union.  In this sense it is entirely different from the UK referendum in June.  The only political parties which took an explicitly anti-EU line during the campaign, and after the results, have no more than 15 per cent of the vote.  And the 59 per cent of No voters will certainly have included people who are pro-European but just did not support the proposed constitutional reforms.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the euro area is now sufficiently robust to deal with the fallout from the referendum result.  In this regard, I note that there was a relatively muted market reaction to the result.  For instance, the spread (that is the difference in 10-year yields) between government bonds of Italy and Germany has remained stable at around 1.7 per cent since the referendum result.  In other words, from a financial market perspective, a "No" vote had been priced in.</p>  <p>  So, in summary, there is little, if any, evidence at this stage to suggest that the outcome of the referendum has had a fall-out for the euro area as a whole.</p></reply>

Deputies will be aware that Revenue has committed to facilitate the appeals process should a taxpayer raise an appeal to the independent Tax Appeal Commission in relation to this issue.  </p>  <p>  In relation to share based remuneration schemes, in general, employees are subject to income tax on share issues where the employer issues such shares and charges the employee less than the market value for them.  Income tax is due on the difference in the relevant values and is generally collected via the PAYE system, while income tax due on share options must be returned within 30 days of the exercise of such options.  In certain cases the relevant shares may be subject to a clog, restricting the employee from selling such shares for a set period of time.  However, notwithstanding this restriction on sale, any income tax due is payable at the time of the share award.</p>  <p>  A more favourable treatment may apply under certain Revenue Approved share schemes, but such schemes are subject to a range of restrictions, and are used primarily by larger, quoted companies.  Deputies will be aware that I announced my intention to introduce a new, SME focussed share-based remuneration incentive in Budget 2018.  This is a complex undertaking, as a focussed scheme of this nature will need to comply with State Aid regulations, and it is likely to require EU approval.</p>  <p>  Therefore, in the years in which the patronage scheme was active, employees who received share based remuneration in an SME company would in most cases have been subject to income tax on any value received.  As such, there would not appear to be a policy rationale to legislate for different treatment specifically for patronage shares in those years.  Furthermore, an amendment of the nature proposed by the Deputy would be retrospective, in that it would change the tax treatment of transactions occurring in the years 2011 to 2013.  Retrospective changes undermine the certainty of the tax system for all taxpayers and can be subject to Constitutional challenge in the courts, and would not be appropriate in this instance.</p></reply>

I would point out, however, that estimating the extent of any illicit activity and the losses to which it gives rise is inherently problematic and must, therefore, be approached with caution.  Unless a clear and credible methodology is specified for particular estimates of illicit trade and the resulting losses, they must be viewed as speculative.</p>  <p>  It is, nevertheless, accepted by all interested parties that smuggling, and shadow economy activities in general, pose a threat to legitimate and compliant businesses and to consumers, as well as depriving the Government of tax revenues.  Tackling these illegal activities is, therefore, a key priority and Revenue has implemented wide-ranging programmes of action to combat them.</p>  <p>  Revenue's actions against the illicit tobacco trade include a range of measures to identify and target those who are involved in the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing those products and prosecuting the persons involved.  This multifaceted strategy also includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and deployment of detection technologies.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, based on the introduction of strict new supply chain controls underpinned by rigorous enforcement action, as well as the very successful introduction, from April 2015, here and in the UK, of a new fiscal marker for marked fuels sourced in cooperation with the UK authorities.</p>  <p>  In the case of alcohol, Revenue's action against illicit trade encompasses the full supply chain for alcohol products and includes measures to confront smuggling, the illicit production of alcohol and the supply or sale of illicit products.</p>  <p>  Action taken by Revenue against smuggling is directed also at prevention of the importation of counterfeit goods and medicines and illegal drugs.</p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with other agencies in the State, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in acting against illegal activities related to smuggling and illicit trade.  The relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a significant proportion of smuggling and other illegal activities.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the Joint Agency Task Force, including Revenue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts, that was established in the framework of "A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan".  Under the aegis of this Task Force, a very successful joint initiative between Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs, directed against suspicious movements of substitute fuel with potential for considerable excise and VAT fraud, won the "Outstanding Collaboration" category at the UK Government's Counter Fraud Awards in September 2016.  From Revenue's perspective, this award recognises the excellent work and cooperation between Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs on investigations into the illegal movement of suspected substitute fuels.</p>  <p>  There is close cooperation also with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat smuggling and illicit trade.</p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that combatting smuggling and illicit trade is and will continue to be, a core element of their work.  For my part, I have taken action through the Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has all the necessary powers to act against these forms of criminal activity and I am satisfied that, as a result, there is a robust legal framework in place that allows effective action to be taken against such crimes.</p></reply>

To this end, Revenue has established an in-house analytics team of eight permanent staff, supported by a technical services team of an additional four permanent staff. The role of this unit is to use statistical and machine-learning methods to support Revenue's risk assessment and operational decision-making. The focus of the team's work is on detecting potentially suspect anomalies in Revenue data, and on learning from the outcomes of past Revenue interventions in order to target non-compliance more accurately in future.    </p>  <p>  The particular project referred to falls into the former category: it aims to identify non-compliant income-tax payers by highlighting those whose declared income is unusually low compared to their peers. To identify such taxpayers, the project draws on a wide range of data sources, including third-party information returns made by financial institutions, insurance providers, government bodies, and other tax administrations.  A predictive model built by Revenue's data analysts then compares each income-tax payer's declared income against the average declared income of other taxpayers with a similar expenditure profile and demographic characteristics. Taxpayers whose declared income is substantially lower than that of their peer group are flagged for further review (and possible intervention) by Revenue staff.  I am advised that similar programmes are used by a number of other tax administrations to better target non-compliance.</p>  <p>  In a small ongoing pilot study, Revenue is examining an initial sample of 72 taxpayers identified through the means described above. When available, the results of this pilot will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach and to refine the case-selection methodology used.  Depending on the effectiveness of the resulting methodology, this approach may be used more widely in future to select cases for Revenue audit or other compliance intervention.  The pilot study may also highlight additional sources of third-party and other data that are required to optimise the effectiveness of the predictive model.</p></reply>

NAMA cannot force the take-up of these properties.  This is a reserved matter for Local Authorities which NAMA engages with on this initiative through the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies.  NAMA advise that, in the majority of cases, NAMA was not given detailed reasons as to why the properties were not required by the local authorities.  However, regular liaison between the Housing Agency and NAMA during the process indicated that the main reasons for rejecting available properties was that there was no demand for social housing in some of the geographic locations where the NAMA debtors  properties were located, or that the housing body and local authority felt that it would result in an over-concentration of social housing in a particular area.  During an appearance before the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, on 12th May 2016, chaired by the Deputy, the NAMA Chairman explained that NAMA's understanding was that units were not accepted &quot;primarily because the units were not in the locations where social housing was needed, or they were too big or too small for their requirement&quot;. </p><p>Ultimately, it is a matter for local authorities and the Housing Agency to determine the suitability of properties for social housing.  Neither NAMA, nor the Department of Finance, has a role in reviewing or assessing these decisions or determining the ultimate suitability of units offered for sale or lease.  Thus, I would advise the Deputy to discuss such a review with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community, and Local Government, which has responsibility for local authorities and the Housing Agency.  However, I would initially refer the Deputy to data which is publically  available on the Housing Agency website, via <i></i>with a detailed breakdown as of December 2016 available at </p><p><i>www.housingagency.ie/Housing/media/Media/Social%20Leasing%20Library/NAMA%20Status%20Reports/Breakdown-by-County-January-2017.pdf.</i></p><p>The Deputy will note that page 7 of that report details the units &quot;No Longer Under Consideration&quot; by local authorities into the following categories: </p><p>- No Demand:  1,052 units:  Includes units in areas local authorities indicated they had no demand for such social housing, or had no demand for the number or type of units offered.  In many cases, a demand for a smaller number of properties in the same development was confirmed with the balance declined on the basis that there was insufficient demand.  These units may have been in unfinished developments outside of urban centres without infrastructural or community supports. </p><p>- No - Sustainable Communities:  1,279 units:  Includes units in areas local authorities considered there was already a high concentration of social housing or, by adding additional properties, the concentration would be unacceptable and not consistent with local authorities' commitment to mixed tenure developments.</p><p>- Not Suitable:  92 units:  Includes units that local authorities deemed were not suitable for social housing, either by virtue of the nature of the development, e.g. holiday home type developments, or the units were in areas of exceptionally high market rents or required high management service charges and therefore were not financially viable to be acquired or leased for social housing purposes.</p><p>- Not Available:  1,770 units:  Includes units that were no longer available to local authorities due to having either been sold or let to the private sector prior to the local authority confirming demand. </p><p>It should be noted that all of the units above, which the local authorities deemed as &quot;no longer under consideration&quot; are no longer available for reconsideration by local authorities as all of these units have now either been sold or let.  </p><p>I am advised that NAMA continues to liaise with the Housing Agency, when NAMA becomes aware of additional availability of units.  Where demand is not confirmed, properties are marketed on the residential sales or rental markets.NAMA advise that there has been no shortage of uptake of these properties in the market.  Almost all remaining properties, owned by NAMA debtors, are now either occupied, for sale, or in process of being readied for sale.  </p><p>I am also advised that NAMA, in its capacity as secured lender, has exposure to just 173 vacant residential properties.  These are frictional vacancies, for example relating to units between tenancies, the number of which will fluctuate over time. </p><p>As a result, the opportunities for additional units being identified for social housing are now quite limited.  The focus of current efforts surrounds the 373 units for which demand has been confirmed by local authorities but have yet to be contracted or delivered, 265 of which are going through pre-appraisal by the local authorities and 108 of which have agreed terms and are awaiting delivery or are under active contract negotiations.</p></reply>

A REIT is a collective investment vehicle designed to hold properties in a tax neutral manner.  I am informed by Revenue that there are currently three REIT established and operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Part 25A provides, inter alia, that a REIT must distribute to its shareholders at least 85% of property income by way of property income dividends.  In the absence of the REIT tax legislation, non-resident REIT shareholders would not have had any liability whatsoever to Irish tax on REIT dividends.  In order to ensure that tax from foreign REIT investors is retained in the State, the REIT tax legislation specifically provided that Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) would apply to REIT dividends at the standard rate of income tax of 20%.  As such, a non-resident REIT investor who might otherwise be exempt from DWT enjoys no exemption in respect of dividends paid by a REIT.  However, non-resident REIT investors from countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.  </p>  <p>  The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to a withholding tax of up 15% on dividends paid from that state.  Subject to specified exceptions within the treaties, the reduced rate applying to dividends paid to investors resident in the countries mentioned in the Deputy's question, as provided for in the respective double taxation agreements, are as follows: 15% in USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland; 10% in China; 0% in Spain and Australia; and in the case of France and Austria no reduction in the 20% rate applies.  Where the investor is a corporate and holds, generally, 25% or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividend the withholding tax rate can be further reduced.</p>  <p>  As no dividends were paid by Irish REITS until 2015, no DWT was deducted in either 2013 or 2014, and consequently no claims for repayment of DWT were made by non-resident investors in either of those two years.  In 2015, DWT amounting to &euro;5,267,914 was collected in respect of dividends paid by Irish REITS, and DWT amounting to &euro;67,955.13 was refunded to non-resident investors in respect of REIT dividends paid in 2015.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution. This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks. </p><p>All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, Chapter 7 (Finance for Growth) of the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 (APJ) set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SME's can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources. Finance for Growth will again feature in the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and a number of actions have been proposed by my Department for inclusion in relation to this.</p><p>In line with Action 144 of the APJ 2016, officials from my Department collated and examined data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors. Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p><p>Regarding the borrowing requirements of the construction sector, data published by the Central Bank of Ireland shows that new lending to the construction sector for Q1 to Q3 2016 totalled &euro;95 million a growth of &euro;16 million when compared to the same period in 2015.  This data can be found in Table A.14.1 Credit Advanced to Irish Resident Small and Medium Sized Enterprises published on the Central Bank's website.  </p><p>It should also be noted that the results of the most recent Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2016, show that when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Demand for credit remains subdued and the latest survey shows only 39% of SMEs in the construction sector requested bank finance in the previous six months a decrease of 9% from September 2015. Furthermore the main reason for not applying for bank finance is that SMEs do not need it or already have it in place (86%). Further results from the survey can be found at . </p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate indigenous viable SMEs, including those in the construction sector, to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

Having said that, developments in the housing market can have an impact on the wider economy so it is in all of our interests that equilibrium is restored to the market.</p>  <p>  A key priority for this Government is to tackle the barriers impeding the development of a fully functioning housing market where supply responds to demand in a sustainable manner. In this regard, my Department and I have actively engaged with, and contributed to, the formulation of the Government's policy response as set out in the Action Plan for Housing, Rebuilding Ireland. </p>  <p>  To complement the Action Plan, Budget 2017 contained a number of additional measures to support house building and homeownership including, for example, the introduction of the Help-to-Buy initiative, the amendments to the Living City Initiative and the extension of mortgage interest relief. The Help-to Buy initiative should help alleviate some of the specific challenges faced by first-time buyers in accessing the housing market, while improvements in the Living City Initiative aim to promote rental supply in the designated urban areas. </p>  <p>  It is too early to assess the impact of these recently adopted measures on the housing market. My Department intends to commission an independent impact assessment of the Help-to-Buy initiative to determine its general impact. This report will be completed by September 2017, prior to Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  On the development finance side, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and the wider National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is examining the feasibility of a new funding vehicle, in conjunction with the private sector, that would be capable of funding the delivery of new mixed-tenure residential developments, and that is both off-balance sheet and commercially viable. Such a fund has the potential to provide in the order of 5,000 additional units over a five-year period for social housing. In addition, ISIF will support the delivery of housing-related enabling infrastructure in large scale priority development areas through the provision of upfront capital to developers with repayments made either as sites or completed housing units are sold.</p></reply>

The subsequent recovery in the economy and the sustained period of employment growth has underpinned the recovery in housing demand. From the trough, house prices have increased by 48 per cent but remain 32 per cent lower than their previous peak in 2007. </p>  <p>  The underlying factors driving house prices now are fundamentally different to those that prevailed in the period leading up to the peak. The current pressures in the housing market reflect an as yet insufficient supply response to meet current demographic demands for housing, leading to house price inflation. The Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness contains a range of actionable measures to address the structural constraints within the housing market which are affecting supply. These  actions aim to streamline the planning system, remove infrastructure blockages and support the delivery of affordable housing, thereby helping to improve the viability of construction in urban areas where supply is particularly constrained. </p>  <p>  Mortgage lending, which helped fuel the speculative behaviour in the housing market prior to the financial crisis, remains low relative to analysts' estimates of the medium term sustainable level of mortgage lending.  The Central Banks macro-prudential regulations aim to curb unsustainable lending practises by regulating the loan-to-income (LTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. The Central Bank has recently completed the first review of the macro-prudential regulations and will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the regulation on an ongoing basis, taking into account changing economic circumstances. </p></reply>

In order to deliver on this ambitious target, the "Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness" adopts a whole of government response with 84 actionable measures across five key pillars, namely Address Homelessness, Accelerate Social Housing, Build More Homes, Improve the Rental Sector, and Utilise Existing Housing. The measures set out in the Action Plan should help to stimulate supply by streamlining the planning system, removing infrastructure blockages and supporting the delivery of affordable housing. </p>  <p>  There have also been certain initiatives in relation to taxation policy and financial macro prudential policy which will assist this overall effort.  For example, the Help-to-Buy initiative should help alleviate some of the specific challenges faced by first time buyers in accessing the housing market. The Help-to-Buy initiative has been designed within the context of Rebuilding Ireland to provide immediate and targeted support for first time buyers in meeting their deposit requirements and encouraging the construction of new housing units whilst the structural measures announced in the Action Plan are being rolled out. My Department will also commission an independent impact assessment of the Help-to-Buy initiative to determine its general impact. This report will be completed by September 2017, prior to Budget 2018.  Also, the recent Central Bank changes residential mortgage lending macro prudential changes will assist households, in particular first time buyers, which are seeking a mortgage to purchase a home.  In general, first time buyers will now require a minimum deposit of 10 per cent of the entire value of the property, with the loan-to-value (LTV) ceiling set at 90 per cent. This replaces the previous situation whereby a deposit of 10 per cent was required on the first &euro;220,000 of the price of a property and 20 per cent on any balance above &euro;220,000.   </p></reply>

Changes since then have given people more choices for what to do with their pension savings. This is called the flexible options at retirement regime. These choices include taking a cash payment, subject to income tax, investing in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or investing in an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF).</p>  <p>  Until he or she is 75, a person can only take the whole amount of their savings as cash or put it in an ARF if he or she has a guaranteed pension income of &euro;12,700 or more. If these conditions are not met then he or she can buy an annuity or put a certain amount of the funds, called the "set aside" amount into an AMRF. The maximum "set-aside" is &euro;63,500 or the remaining value of the pension funds, after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum, if less than &euro;63,500.</p>  <p>  The funds in an AMRF can be used at any time, in full or in part, to buy an annuity. This includes the option to buy an annuity which is large enough to give the owner a guaranteed income of more than &euro;12,700. If the owner does this he or she will then have access to the rest of the funds, as their AMRF then converts into and ARF with discretionary access to the funds, subject to tax at their marginal rate.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that a person without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension "safety net" to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement. However, every year to age 75, the owner of an AMRF can access 4% of the funds in the AMRF.</p>  <p>  If an individual meets the requirements to be able to access the full amount of the funds in an AMRF and chooses to do so then it is taxable in the hands of the recipient as income for the tax year in which it is paid.</p>  <p>  I do not currently have any plans to remove the requirements which apply before a person can have increased access to the funds in an AMRF or transfer them to an ARF. These provisions, along with other taxation measures, are however kept under review. </p></reply>

In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy if aware, a key objective of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources. The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders. The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and five non-bank on-lending partners. The SBCI has a current funding capacity of &euro;1.05 billion which it makes available to its on-lending partners as demand from SMEs arises. To the end of September 2016, a total of &euro;458 million has been lent to over 10,600 SMEs and the SBCI has committed a total of &euro;906 million to its eight on-lending partners. In 2017, the SBCI will continue to make significant funding available to SMEs across Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Another recent initiative is the &euro;150 million Cash Flow Support Loan Fund for Farmers announced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This fund will provide highly flexible, low interest loans to farming SMEs. </p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.</p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Review Office overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives. </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth. I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie. The results of this survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved. Purchases, replacement or lease of new vehicle/equipment is now provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 29% stating this is why they requested bank finance. Working capital/cash flow requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 27% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 73% of working capital coming from this source (up 6%).  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.</p>  <p>  The SME State Bodies Group, chaired by my Department, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance. As the Deputy will be aware, the Action Plan for Jobs over the past number of years has set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.  These Government policies have supported year on year increases in new lending to the farming sector, as measured by the Central Bank.   </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the SBCI have reported that, as at end June 2016, 24% of their loans (by value) were to SMEs operating in the agriculture sector.  </p>  <p>  All viable SMEs operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy and the Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit to viable SMEs including those in the farming community.</p></reply>

This was established to the satisfaction of SUSI in accordance with Article 21 (3)(b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2016.  Therefore, the income of her parents was not taken into account.   </p>  <p>  In assessing an application for the 2016/17 academic year, SUSI will have regard to the following qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant as set out in the Student Grant Scheme 2016:</p>  <p>  1. The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant;</p>  <p>  2. Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;22,703;</p>  <p>  3. As at 31st of December 2015, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in the Student Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  There is no discretion to deviate from these particular provisions of the Student Grant Scheme and governing legislation.</p>  <p>  However, if an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe.</p>  <p>  The current system of student supports is underpinned by the Student Support Act, 2011. It is my intention to initiate a review of this legislation later this year to identify areas where the Act needs to be updated to reflect the changes that have taken place in Irish society in 2011 and also to ensure that our system of student supports is targeted effectively at those most in need. All relevant issues will be considered as part of this review. </p></reply>

The procedures make very clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur, and the lead role of the Child and Family Agency in this area. </p>  <p>  It is the School Boards of Management's responsibility to ensure that all school personnel and board of management members have the necessary familiarity with the Child Protection Procedures for schools to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities under those procedures.  The procedures for schools have envisaged that this will be achieved by the school developing a culture of awareness and knowledge of the procedures amongst all school personnel and, where considered appropriate, ensuring that external training is undertaken.</p></reply>

In respect of NEPS staffing, NEPs psychologists are recruited via regional panels formed from national recruitment competitions administered by the Public Appointments service.</p><p>In the case of some schools, NEPs psychologists may no longer be assigned to those schools as a result of retirement, resignation or transfer to another NEPs region, and while every effort was made to fill the resulting vacancy during 2016 from the existing PAS panels was not successful and the panel was closed.</p><p>A new national recruitment competition was has been put in place by PAS to fill vacancies within all NEPS Regions.

This increase in apprentice registration is primarily being driven by employers in the electrical, engineering and motor sectors with modest growth occurring in construction related apprenticeships.  Budget 2017 saw &euro;80 million made available from the National Training Fund (NTF).  This is &euro;20 million greater than the 2016 allocation to provide for increased apprenticeship activity in 2017. The 2018 and future year allocations will be considered through the budgetary process, taking into account forecast increased participation in existing apprenticeships and traineeships and the costs of development and roll out of new apprenticeship programmes and career traineeships.</p><p>SOLAS regularly conducts evaluations on the imbalances in skills supply and demand in the workplace, including the construction sector and provides forecasts of the apprenticeship requirements over a five year period.  SOLAS in partnership with the Higher Education Authority and Education and Training Boards Ireland ensures sufficient training provision and resources are in place to meet the labour market demands for apprentices.  SOLAS has recently produced the 2016 National Skills Bulletin (NSB) where shortage indicators are highlighted across a range of construction-related occupations.  The data and trends provided in the 2016 NSB will feed into the annual service planning process which incorporates the planning of construction related apprenticeships by SOLAS in conjunction with Education and Training Boards and Institutes of Technology.The forecast for future apprenticeship registrations remains strong and it is predicted that craft based apprentice registrations will continue to grow incrementally up to 2020. SOLAS is working with its partners to ensure adequate capacity exists within the education and training sector to meet this expected increase in apprentice registrations over the next five years.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in the matter of the pupil referred to in the Deputy's question and can inform the Deputy that a meeting has been scheduled to take place this month between school authorities, the child's parents and the NEPS psychologist to determine what actions are appropriate in his regard.  </p></reply>

In the case of ETB schools, vetting of such persons was conducted via the relevant ETB.</p>  <p>  In April 2016, the Minister for Justice and Equality commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 (the Vetting Act) which put in place statutory requirements for the Garda vetting of persons involved in working with children and vulnerable persons.</p>  <p>  The Vetting Act applies not just to schools but to any relevant organisation that employs, contracts, permits or places a person in relevant work with children or vulnerable persons.  The Vetting Act provides that vetting is conducted by the National Vetting Bureau on foot of an application by a relevant organisation that is registered with it.  The vetting legislation and the vetting procedures operated by the National Vetting Bureau fall within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  When the vetting requirements were commenced last April, my Department issued circular 0031/2016 which set out the statutory vetting requirements applicable to schools along with the practical arrangements in place to support the vetting procedures.  A Frequently Asked Questions document was also published by my Department to assist schools with queries in respect of the circular.</p>  <p>  At the same time, I commenced the vetting related provisions of the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act, 2015 which, inter alia, enabled the Teaching Council to put in place a streamlined mechanism for school employers to meet the statutory vetting requirements in respect of registered teachers.  The existence of the Teaching Council, as a statutory body with a statutory role in the registration of registered teachers, has enabled my Department to bring forward the relevant legislative provisions under the Teaching Council Amendment Act 2015 which have  allowed for such a streamlined mechanism to be put in place in the case of registered teachers.  However, it is not possible for my Department to put in place similar legislative arrangements in respect of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Under the new statutory vetting procedures, the vetting of Ss and other non-teaching staff continues to be conducted via the relevant diocesan office or school management body as the relevant conduit organisation for the vetting of Ss and other non-teaching staff employed by schools. In the case of ETB schools the relevant ETB is the relevant organisation for such vetting. My Department understands that the majority of these bodies are now using the National Vetting Bureau's electronic vetting facility.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016. The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.</p>  <p>  During the growth and development phase of Droichead, teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting must avail of the Droichead programme to achieve full registration with the Council.  While a new policy on teacher probation was adopted by the Teaching Council last December, this does not change the requirement for teachers in a special education setting to avail of Droichead.</p>  <p>  The INTO issued a directive to its members not to co-operate with or participate in Droichead from 1 July 2016.

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016. The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.</p>  <p>  During the growth and development phase of Droichead, teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting must avail of the Droichead programme to achieve full registration with the Council.  While a new policy on teacher probation was adopted by the Teaching Council last December, this does not change the requirement for teachers in a special education setting to avail of Droichead.</p>  <p>  The INTO issued a directive to its members not to co-operate with or participate in Droichead from 1 July 2016. This directive has prevented newly qualified teachers employed in special education settings from participating in Droichead since September and thereby closed off the registration pathway. I hope the INTO will review its approach.</p>  <p>  My Department is also considering the impact of the new policy adopted by the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  A reply to the correspondence has issued to the person concerned.</p></reply>

This outlines the Department's vision to further embed technology and digital learning in primary and post-primary schools, through detailed actions in areas including curriculum support, digital content, and teacher CPD.</p>  <p>  The rates of per capita payment being given to primary and post-primary students for the ICT Infrastructure grants reflect the rate difference of the overall capitation paid by the Department to students in primary and post-primary schools. Post-primary schools generally have a greater number of teaching spaces to equip and maintain, and have a broader curriculum and more specialised curricular areas to support. The pupil-teacher ratio in post-primary schools is lower, which means that they generally have a greater number of teachers. This is the approach typically taken by the Department in relation to similar grant schemes that apply to primary and post-primary.</p></reply>

Provision is also made for early intervention for children with autism.</p>  <p>  As tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that the educational programme provided generally reflects that which would be provided in a school environment.</p>  <p>  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard for Home Tuition generally reflects that required in a school environment. Accordingly, it is a condition of the scheme that parents/guardians must recruit a tutor who is qualified in the relevant sector, and is registered with the Teaching Council, similar to the requirement for teachers in schools.</p>  <p>  Where all efforts have failed to secure the services of a teacher qualified to teach in the sector concerned, the Department may consider the engagement of a person who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in a relevant area.</p>  <p>  It is also a requirement of the scheme that all tutors must be vetted prior to commencing the delivery of tuition. Parents are required to satisfy themselves that tutors have been vetted by the Teaching Council of Ireland since 29th April 2016 via the Teaching Council's online vetting process.</p>  <p>  Parents were advised through the Home Tuition Circular 0046/2016, which issued in July 2016, that the vetting process could take a number of weeks. Officials in my Department have not to date been made aware of any substantial delays in this regard.</p>  <p>  The operation of the Home Tuition Grant Scheme is reviewed annually.

The 2017 research allocation is &euro;40.6 m for these three bodies.</p><p>The Irish Research Council mainly funds postgraduate students and early stage postdoctoral researchers and cover the full range of disciplines spanning the humanities, social sciences, business, law, sciences, engineering and technology. Awards are made on a competitive basis on the basis of excellence following assessment by expert independent panels. HEAnet is Ireland's National Education and Research Network, providing internet connectivity and associated ICT services to higher education and research organisations throughout Ireland. Its e-Infrastructure services underpin the academic research and education activity for the third level sector, as well as providing e-infrastructure to all the primary and post-primary schools. ICHEC is Ireland's national high performance computer centre, providing high-performance computing services, support, education and training for researchers in higher education institutions and Irish enterprise.</p><p>The Annual Accounts of the Higher Education Authority provide a thematic breakdown, including research, of the funding it issues to the higher education institutions. The extracts from these annual accounts for 2006 to 2015 (latest date) showing this thematic breakdown is attached. The research funding would cover a number of areas, including the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI), Irish Research Council, HEAnet, ICHEC, E-Journals and Irish Aid. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, since 2010 funds the PRTLI, and it also co-funds e-journals and ICHEC; while the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade funds Irish Aid.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016. The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.</p>  <p>  During the growth and development phase of Droichead, teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting must avail of the Droichead programme to achieve full registration with the Council.  While a new policy on teacher probation was adopted by the Teaching Council last December, this does not change the requirement for teachers in a special education setting to avail of Droichead.</p>  <p>  The INTO issued a directive to its members not to co-operate with or participate in Droichead from 1 July 2016. This directive has prevented newly qualified teachers employed in special education settings from participating in Droichead since September and thereby closed off the registration pathway. I hope the INTO will review its approach.</p>  <p>  My Department is also considering the impact of the new policy adopted by the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  A reply to the correspondence has issued to the person concerned.</p></reply>

The ASTI Central Executive Committee took a decision to put the outcome of the talks process to a ballot of members with a recommendation to reject. The ASTI's leadership have taken a view on the proposals.  It is now over to the members to form their view. </p><p>The proposals provide ASTI members with an opportunity to benefit from the programme of pay restoration which commenced under recent public service agreements and which I have used to negotiate with TUI and INTO for substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.</p><p>In addition, there are other immediate undoubted benefits for individual ASTI members in accepting the proposals including:</p><p>- Avoiding an increment freeze</p><p>- Inclusion of the S&amp;amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the pay scale</p><p>- Continued alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions</p><p>- The Ward Report measures and a revised sequence for filling posts which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before</p><p>- An increase in the quantum of the Croke Park hours that can be worked on other than a whole-school basis</p><p>- A review of the usage of the Croke Park hours</p><p>- Protection against compulsory redundancy.</p><p>ASTI members will have to weigh these benefits up for themselves. These benefits are only available to ASTI members if they vote to accept. ASTI's membership now have a decision to make as to whether to accept the TCC proposals and the immediate benefits on offer or to engage again in industrial action. It is for the ASTI leadership to explain its strategy in respect of the latter approach.</p><p>ASTI's ballot will take place over the coming weeks. While that process is ongoing it would not be helpful for me to comment further.</p><p>In respect of Junior Cycle, as part of the November proposals, it was confirmed that a second calendar window will be provided in the current school year to allow current third year English students to complete their externally assessed Assessment Task (worth 10% of final exam). The arrangements for this have now been communicated to schools.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.</p>  <p>  The arrangement in Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme, as negotiated with the European Commission, whereby the intensive sectors (pig, poultry and mushroom composts) were allowed to apply manures in excess of crop requirement, expired at the end of 2016. The arrangement was put in place in 2006 to assist the industry to comply with the regulations and has been moving the industry towards full compliance over the intervening 10 years. However, in order to allow time for all possible options to be explored during the forthcoming Nitrates Action Programme review, pig slurry imported in the closed period from 2017 and not applied by the year-end will be treated as inventory for application in the following year rather than being considered as applied in the year of importation.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has commenced the process of review of the Nitrates Action Programme prior to formal engagement with the European Commission with a view to having a new Nitrates Action Programme in place by 2018 to run up to 2021. A request for a new nitrates derogation will be submitted to the Commission as part of the review process. A full consultation process will be carried out in early 2017 as part of this review and any issues raised by stakeholders will be considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

The LGMA has confirmed that the process was conducted in a fair and transparent manner and in full compliance with all regulations, policies and guidelines governing public procurement in Ireland.

A range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers.</p>  <p>  The Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme, which operated from 1999 until 2002, has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term.  My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts. </p>  <p>  In addition, the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers was reduced to 2.3% with effect from 1 July 201 6, which has helped many Shared Ownership borrowers. </p>  <p>  An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers since 1 April 2016.  This new restructuring option involves rolling-up all outstanding debt into a single annuity loan &ndash; i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance, rental equity balance, plus any arrears &ndash; with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood. </p>  <p>  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their Rental Equity balance.  The feasibility of this new option for each SO borrower will be determined by their local authority, and may not be appropriate in all cases.  For example, in some instances, continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.  Detailed guidance, training and direction have been provided by my Department and the Housing Agency to local authorities regarding the implementation of the measure and my Department is continuing to monitor the impact of the new measure for borrowers.   </p>  <p>  Local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement.

In their report, the UN Committee expressed concern at the housing situation in Ireland, and noted in particular the limited supply of social housing and the level of homelessness amongst families and children.  The Committee went on to urge Ireland to adopt policies to tackle these problems. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the report in question reflected the position at the end of 2015. Since the UN Committee's observations were made, the Government has published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  Under that Action Plan, launched in July 2016, urgent action is being taken to deal with the challenges that currently exist in the housing sector and which were referred to by the UN Committee.  The Plan sets out a clear roadmap to achieve the Government's goals to significantly increase and expedite the delivery of social housing, boost private housing construction, improve the rental market, and deliver on the commitment to see housing supply, in overall terms, more than double to some 25,000 new homes every year by 2020. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan has a particular focus on meeting the housing needs of the most vulnerable members of Irish society.  It is recognised that accommodating family units in hotels is inappropriate for anything other than a short period of time and a very clear target has been set to ensure that by mid-2017, hotels are used only in very limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families.  With regard to social housing, 47,000 new social housing units will be provided by 2021 under the Action Plan, at a cost of &euro;5.35 billion. </p>  <p>  With reference to evictions, I believe that there are now robust legal protections in place across all tenure types to ensure that families are not removed from their homes without access to appropriate redress.  Security of tenure in the social housing sector is well protected by the provisions of the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014. Social housing tenancies are lifetime in nature and evictions can only take place in very limited and prescribed circumstances.  Social tenants have a right under legislation to appeal any decisions made to evict.  However, I know that local authorities are committed to working with their tenants to resolve their housing problems with evictions seen very much as a last resort. </p>  <p>  In relation to the private rented sector, key concerns for households relate to rent uncertainty and associated security of tenure concerns.  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 introduced a right to a four year tenancy (recently increased to 6 years), with limited grounds for a termination where a tenant has been in occupation for six months continuously and no notice to quit has been served.  Amendments introduced in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by providing for measures that will guard against, for example, landlords falsely declaring that the property is needed for a family member, or that it is going to be sold.  In addition, the Act provides for graduated increases in the notice periods that must be given to tenants of the termination of a tenancy so that a landlord must now give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days' notice for tenancies of 8 years or more.  The Act also provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is increased from 12 to 24 months.  In addition, the Act increased the minimum period of notice of new rent from 28 days to 90 days. </p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, which I published in December 2016, is building on this work by introducing a Rent Predictability Measure, to cap rent increases at 4% per year in designated Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs). RPZs have now been given a statutory basis via the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork city. RPZs are to be designated for a maximum period of three years by which time it is anticipated that new supply will have come on stream and pressures will have eased somewhat in the areas concerned.   </p></reply>

Of these, 2,723 were ineligible or terminated during the process, 217 have been completed with 635 being actively progressed.  The reasons why a case has not progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.</p><p>Statistical information relating to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme since its inception, including statistics on cases that have been terminated and the reasons for same, is available on the Housing Agency's website at the following weblink: </p><p>A number of amendments were made to the MTR Scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers. </p><p>Notwithstanding the amendments already made, the Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and has included a review of the MTR Scheme as an action in Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The review, currently underway and due for completion shortly, is examining how the scheme can work better for borrowers.</p><p>Where a borrower's MTR application has not been successful there are a number of other options available in such circumstances.  For those borrowers who are ineligible for the MTR scheme, but qualify for social housing support, they should engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their housing needs if they feel they are in danger of losing their home.  Where a borrower is deemed to qualify for social housing support, there are other housing support options available immediately from the local authority such as the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). </p><p>The Government has established a new Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, known as <i>Abhaile</i>, and operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) in conjunction with the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), the Legal Aid Board and the Citizens Information Board. The objective of the Abhaile Scheme is to ensure that a person who is at risk of losing their home due to their mortgage arrears can access independent expert financial and legal advice, which will help them to identify their best options for returning to solvency &ndash; with priority to their remaining in their home, where that is a sustainable option. The website contains comprehensive details of the supports available under the Scheme. </p></reply>

The Government considered the Convention report in February 2015 and decided that it would be necessary to analyse the full range of legal, practical and policy issues arising before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum on the matter.  The estimated costs arising would also need to be fully analysed and considered.  The Government asked the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in co-operation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, to analyse these issues and to report back to the Government in due course.</p>  <p>  A range of complex and interrelated issues are being examined as part of the analysis being undertaken.

Questions arise as to whether voting rights should be extended to all citizens resident outside the State or to particular categories of citizens such as passport holders, those born in Ireland or those who have lived outside the State for a limited period.  The registration of voters who are resident outside the State and the way in which they would be enabled to vote are other important matters that need to be considered.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-17a.1210.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017011700083#WRW03900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 471, 496 and 524 together.</p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.  The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and it is my intention that the scheme will be available nationally by April 2017.   </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. </p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties. </p>  <p>  A scheme of this nature will require both significant capital and current exchequer investment expenditure over the next 5 years and therefore must be properly analysed and assessed to ensure the best use of public money.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is appropriately modelled from a financial perspective but also, and critically, that it is workable from local authorities' and AHBs' perspectives and delivers high quality social housing effectively. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency, who are assisting with implementation of the scheme, are in regular contact with the two pilot local authorities and I understand that the pilot is progressing well at a local level. In parallel, my Department is also in contact with other local authorities to assist them with necessary preparations for the rollout of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Several AHBs are working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas and, as the scheme becomes available nationally, I expect that more AHBs will become involved in its roll out. AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and their experience puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  Waterford and Carlow have been advertising the scheme with local media and have made good progress in engagements with property owners.  I understand that they have also been actively targeting properties that they are aware have been vacant for more than a year and would be suitable for social housing within city and town centres.  Equally, Carlow County Council has indicated that many property owners expressing an interest have properties outside of town centres. Inspections of potential units have also commenced in both authorities.  Some of the properties that are being put forward have not been suitable for social housing. In other instances, property owners have opted to explore selling the property to the local authority instead.  The availability of the complementary Buy and Renew scheme, which I also launched in October, means that local authorities and AHBs, will have a range of funding mechanisms available to them to harness the social housing opportunity these vacant properties present. </p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period.  While the current target for 2017 is 150 units, the interest expressed by property owners and stakeholders so far indicates that the 2017 target will be achieved and may even be exceeded following national rollout.  Depending on the capacity of local authorities and AHBs to deliver under the scheme, as well as the necessary agreement on the financial considerations arising, I would certainly be supportive of the acceleration of delivery under the new scheme.   </p>  <p>  I would encourage any local a authorities that are eager to engage early with the scheme to liaise with the pilot local authorities and my Department, in order to be familiar with the requirements around participation and also the practical implementation issues that are being worked through with the pilot scheme. </p></reply>

A copy of the form used for complaints to the Courts regarding barking is available from local authorities.  The Court may make an order, requiring the occupier of the premises in which the dog is kept to abate the nuisance by exercising due control over the dog.  The Court may also limit the number of dogs that can be kept on a premises or may direct that the dog be delivered to a dog warden to be dealt with as an unwanted dog.  While complaints in relation to barking dogs are largely dealt with under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts, the position in relation to noise nuisance generally is that a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.
