I do not have specific legislative responsibilities in this area. Where a crime may have been committed it falls to An Garda Siochana to investigate. The Department of Justice and Equality also has responsibility for the Office for Internet Safety which takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.</p><p>The Action Plan on Bullying is being led by the Department of Education and Skills. National anti-bullying procedures place a requirement on schools to record, investigate and address incidences of bullying and cyber-bullying, both in and out of school. The procedures highlight the need for parents and young people to understand how to protect themselves at home, in school, or in the community.  </p><p>The Minister for Communications Energy &amp;amp; Natural Resources recently published the Report of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group and announced the establishment of an implementation group to be chaired by his Department to oversee consideration of the report&rsquo;s recommendations including on issues to do with bullying and harassment on line.</p><p>There are a range of support services in place to support children and young people who are coping with bullying situations. , a Department of Education and Skills initiative, provides information for parents and teachers about the risks involved and how to protect children against cyber-bullying. Many of the youth services, funded by my Department, provide services to address bullying issues, increase awareness about internet safety and social media and to promote young people&rsquo;s wellbeing.  </p><p>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children provides that serious incidents of bullying should be reported to the Child and Family Agency. Following assessment and where required, appropriate support will be put in place. In addition to support for the family and the child which can be provided by the Child and Family Agency in relation to serious incidents, there are also a range of services provided by the HSE, including Child and Adolescent Mental Health services which may be relevant depending on the nature of the condition being experienced by a child. Services provided by the HSE fall within the remit of the Minister for Health. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Government colleagues and I are actively engaged in addressing the issues raised, as is evident in the Action Plan for Bullying and the very recently launched Report of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-01a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070100053#WRA01400"><p>The Early Childcare Supplement was introduced in April 2006 to assist parents with the costs of caring for children in their pre-school years.  Due to the need to reduce public expenditure, a number of reductions were made to the  Early Childcare Supplement from 2009 and the then Government took a decision to abolish the Early Childcare Supplement with effect from the 31st December 2009.  At its peak the payment cost &euro;480 million in 2008.  Some of the funding previously available to support the provision of the  Early Childcare Supplement was re-directed to provide for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, or free pre-school year, at an annual cost of &euro;175 million.</p><p>  The redirection of resources to this more targeted and child-centred policy is in line with the generally held principle that pre-primary education is a key determinant of student performance at all levels of education as it leads to improvements in motivation and the propensity to learn, which in turn raises the social and private returns from all future investments in their education.  It also addressed the general criticism of the  Early Childcare Supplement that it directed resources away from a more targeted and beneficial investment in early years care and education, in particular in the form of pre-school education.</p><p>  While I believe the last Government missed a great opportunity to re-direct more money from the Early Childcare Supplement into promoting greater quality and accessibility for early childhood care and education, this Government has no plans to re-introduce the Early Childcare Supplement.  Even if such funding was available from the Exchequer, its re-introduction would not be a good use of resources which would yield much greater benefits if used to directly support quality early years services.</p><p>  This Government has made a very significant commitment in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the current budgetary situation.   The Early Childhood Care and Education programme, which represents an investment of almost &euro;175 million annually, is funded by my Department through the provision of capitation grants paid directly to participating services.  It is a fundamental principle of the programme that the pre-school provision is available to parents free of charge.  In the region of 68,000 children benefit from the free pre-school provision each year.</p><p>  There is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years.  The provision of targeted funding to support specific early years childcare programmes is considered the best option for the use of the available resources and the Government will continue to fund these programme with an emphasis on improving the quality of the services provided.</p></reply>

I have publicly confirmed that the intended scope of this investigation will go beyond the home operated by the Sisters of Bon Secours in Tuam, Co. Galway and will include the Bethany Home. The incorporation of any further institutions or homes, including those mentioned in the question will receive detailed consideration in the finalisation of the terms of reference for the proposed Commission of Investigation.</p><p>  The Commission of Investigation will be statutory and independent and will operate under the Commission of Investigations Act, 2004. The process of developing detailed terms of reference for the Commission is being supported by a high level Cross Departmental Review Committee.  </p><p>  Public calls to include a range of institutions, and concerns related to particular practices, are also being considered as part of this work.  A key task of the initial scoping exercise is to ensure that a realistic approach is taken to the investigation so that the Commission is in a position to operate in a workable and effective manner. </p><p>  As well as working closely with my own officials, I have also met with representatives of a number of key advocacy groups and Church leaders, including the Adoption Rights Alliance, First Mothers Group, Bethany Homes Survivors Group, C&uacute;namh, Adoption Loss and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin. I also hope to meet with Archbishop Jackson at his earliest availability. </p><p>  The submissions made to me during these constructive discussions, together with those received through my Department&rsquo;s dedicated e-mail facility, will feed into the process.  I am confident that this inclusive approach in the essential scoping phase will assist in establishing an inquiry which is capable of effectively addressing these important matters in a sensitive and timely manner. </p><p>  The position as outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, in response to a recent Parliamentary Question on this issue may be of interest to the Deputy. Minister Fitzgerald advised the House that the facts available regarding Magdalen laundries have already been set out in detail in the McAleese report which exceeds 1,000 pages. The women concerned have received an apology from the Taoiseach, had the opportunity to relate their stories to both Mr McAleese and Judge Quirke and are entitled to receive a capital sum of up to &euro;100,000 depending on duration of stay as well as life-long pension top up payments and access to medical services.  </p><p>  The McAleese report examined the links between Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalen Laundries. His statistical analysis of the known entry routes into Magdalen laundries for the period 1920 onwards showed that less than 4% of entries were from Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies. </p><p>  In the light of the above, the Minister suggested that there was a valid question as to how inclusion of the Magdalene Laundries within terms of reference of another inquiry would be in the interest of or be of benefit to the women in question. </p><p>  I can assure the House that I am committed to arriving at a proposed approach to the scope of the Commission shortly following the Government's careful consideration of these matters.</p></reply>

It is chaired by Dr Helen Buckley and is independent in its functions.  All cases of the death or of a serious incident concerning children in care, in aftercare or known to the Agency child protection services,  in keeping with Health Information Quality Authority Guidance,<i></i>are reviewed by the National Review Panel. </p><p>The National Review Panel&rsquo;s individual and annual reports are published on the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s website and are available for the three year period between 2010 and 2012.  The National Review Panel Annual Report of 2012 did not find that the action or inaction of the Agency contributed to the death of a child. The Panel did however find areas of practice that required improvement. </p><p>While it is important to acknowledge that in some cases, disappointing deficiencies in practice are highlighted, it is also important to acknowledge that case work has improved.  Managers and front line professional staff are more aware of the importance of recognising and responding to neglect while making sure that the long term impact on the future health and well being of a child is also recognised and responded to with good quality services. </p><p>Improvements must also be made, where necessary, in the mechanism employed to review serious incidents and deaths of children in care. In this regard work has been ongoing between officials in my Department, the National Review Panel, the Child and Family Agency and HIQA to ensure that the process and procedures around reviews are further supported and strengthened so as to ensure that the panel is assisted in producing robust reports in a timely fashion. </p><p>In this regard the Guidance for the Reviews, originally drafted in 2010, is currently being revised. This document will address issues in relation to the timing and publication of reports, implementation plans and reviews for panel recommendations and reporting lines for the panel to ensure its independence.  I also intend to strengthen the operation of the National Review Panel by asking HIQA to undertake an audit/oversight role in relation to the processes of the Panel to which  HIQA have agreed in principle.</p><p>I anticipate that a new Guidance document, agreed between all stake holders, will emerge in the coming weeks.</p><p>Since the establishment of the Agency significant reform centred on co-ordination, accountability, oversight and multi-agency working has commenced and includes:</p><p>- A national service delivery model to ensure effective oversight and accountability in meeting the needs of young people.</p><p>- Out of hours services had been expanded to address the needs of young people who present in emergency situations outside of normal working hours.</p><p>- A new assessment framework which provides greater oversight of Care Plans or Child Protection Plans. Care planning is also now benchmarked and monitored against national guidance.</p><p>- A Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the Health Service Executive ensures that complex cases are discussed across agencies at six weekly intervals. Multi-agency working is also being improved through the development of protocols around information sharing.</p><p>- A dedicated Aftercare Service to standardise the delivery of Leaving and Aftercare services across the country so that every young person who is eligible will be provided with services to meet their specific needs.</p></reply>

The Centre incurred expenditure of &euro;2.022m in 2013 and received funding amounting to &euro;1.96m, resulting in a deficit of &euro;62,000. Projections by the Centre show that income of approximately &euro;1.8m is anticipated during 2014.  With such a level of financial support available it should be possible to work constructively to continue services and avoid the closure scenario that has previously been outlined by the Centre. </p><p>  Senior representatives from the Child and Family Agency, Pobal, Dublin City Childcare Committee and representatives from the board and management of the Centre have met on a number of occasions to explore options available to allow the service operate on a sustainable basis within the allocated funding. A number of options were considered and to assist in this process, Dublin City Childcare Committee engaged the services of an external mentor to undertake an independent detailed analysis of the matter.</p><p>  I understand that the external mentor will complete their report by mid July, 2014.  The objective is to ensure the development of a sustainable model of service delivery into the future. </p><p>  In parallel, a wider examination will be undertaken of the level and range of early years services supported by the State in the Darndale/Belcamp/Moatview area generally.   </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency, as one of a number of State funders of the Centre, agreed and has made additional pre-payments to the end of August.  This is in addition to previous pre-payments advanced for May and June.  </p><p>  I very much welcome the process of engagement which is in place and I hope that a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at which will ensure the continued operation of the Centre within the significant funding levels available.</p></reply>

They are Ballydowd in Dublin for girls and boys, Gleann Alainn in Cork which is for girls only and Coovagh House in Limerick for boys only. These Units are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority, who reported positively on the level of care being provided in the three Special Care Units in the most recent inspections undertaken in 2013.</p><p>  At any one time approximately 0.3% of all children in care are detained in the three Special Care Units. </p><p>  As part of the Child and Family Agency's commitment to develop a comprehensive continuum of care services to meet the divergent and complex needs of all children in care, Crann&oacute;g Nua High Support Unit, Portrane is to be redesignated to function as a Special Care Unit. An upgrade of current buildings, with an additional new build residential unit, will be required to provide secure care.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-01a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070100053#WRA03000"><p>Recent years have seen a significant fall-off in the number of intercountry adoptions taking place internationally. These trends reflect the significant decline in recent years in the number of children, particularly infants, available for adoption, as child welfare and protection systems have improved in developing countries which previously placed large numbers of children for adoption.   In many cases these reforms in countries of origin have been given expression and impetus by their ratification of the Hague Convention.  The Convention requires members to strengthen protections for children, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process and to prioritise the improvement of systems for the care and adoption of children domestically.  This requirement is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 21. With the passing of the Adoption Act 2010 Ireland ratified the Hague Convention on the 1st November 2010 and is now one of 93 contracting States to the Convention.  </p><p>  The Adoption Authority continues to promote cooperation in intercountry adoption with relevant countries.  The Adoption Authority has successfully concluded administrative arrangements with both Vietnam and the US and adoptions from these countries are continuing. In recent weeks adoptions have recommenced from Vietnam for the first time since 2009. The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of other Hague Convention countries in relation to intercountry adoptions including Bulgaria, China, Thailand, the Philippines and India.  The Authority has recently visited Haiti as part of an initial examination of intercountry adoption with Haiti.</p><p>  It is important to recognise that, although a country may be a member of Hague, legal and administrative obstacles may remain, there may be no children available for adoption, restrictions may be imposed in relation to the categories of children or prospective adoptive parents qualifying or the host country may not wish to prioritise cooperation with Ireland from amongst the countries wishing to establish relations.   </p><p>  With regard to dealings with non-Hague countries, work is ongoing in relation to discussions on a bilateral adoption agreement with the Russian Federation. The Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation have advised the Irish Embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements are currently on hold while the Russian Government considers proposals in relation to how they deal with adoption agreements in general. It is understood that the Russian Federation's Supreme Court recently made recommendations regarding adoption agreements and these are currently being considered by the Russian Government. It is hoped that following the Russian Government's consideration of these matters they will be in a position to examine and respond to the Irish proposals.  </p><p>  I am also aware that Ethiopia is currently seeking to bring its adoption standards up to those required under the Hague Convention and I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me updated on the position. Work is ongoing in relation to trying to establish the position of the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Ethiopia with regard to the desire of the Ethiopian authorities to entering into talks in relation to a bilateral agreement with Ireland.  </p></reply>

The programme is expected to cost about &euro;175m in the current year, including the cost of administration.  </p><p>  Just over 65,000 children participated in the programme in the 2011/2012 school year.  Approximately 68,000 children availed of the provision in the 2012/2013 academic year, and similar numbers are expected to avail of the provision during this academic year.   A total of 4,220 childcare providers are participating in the programme in this academic year and a table listing those service providers is being forwarded directly to the Deputy.  </p><p>  Despite the challenging budgetary situation, the pre-school year has been maintained as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality pre-school services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.</p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence quantifying the benefits of early years interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.    A second free pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000-5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time. </p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not presently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Early Years Quality Agenda, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered as part of the preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy.  The report of the Expert Advisory Group which I appointed to advise on recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy, &lsquo;Right from the Start&rsquo;, sets out a wide range of recommendations for consideration and will contribute substantially to the final draft of the Early Years Strategy.  One of the recommendations in the Report for consideration in the preparation of the Strategy is to extend the free pre-school provision, but only after achieving higher quality standards, more investment in training and mentoring, and professionalisation of the Early Years workforce.</p></reply>

The introduction of this legislation is in line with a key Programme for Government commitment, and it represents an important and necessary addition to the child welfare and protection system.</p><p>  Certain persons, who are mandated persons under the Bill, will be required by the legislation to report child welfare and protection concerns to the Child and Family Agency. Mandated persons will also be required to report to the Agency any disclosures of harm made to the mandated person by a child.  The reporting of harm to children by persons, who by virtue of their training, qualifications and professional experience are well equipped to recognise harm, is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessment of risk by the Agency. The Bill also provides that organisations providing services to children will have to consider the potential for risk to children availing of their services and demonstrate awareness and good practice in a Child Safeguarding Statement which will be available to parents and the public generally. </p><p>  The Bill will operate side-by-side with the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns. It is intended that the Guidance will be revised and updated to take account of new legislative obligations so as to provide in one place a complete reference resource for individuals and organisations.  This will provide clarity and ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society. </p><p>  As regards implementation, my Department is taking a lead role in the cross-sectoral implementation of Children First. A Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group has been established involving all of the key Government Departments together with the Child and Family Agency and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Bill includes a provision to place this Group on a statutory basis. The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure a consistent approach is adopted. </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency is undertaking significant operational reform of the child protection system.  To date this has included, following publication of the Children First Guidance, the implementation of Children First training and the publication of a Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook.  </p><p>  It is also important to emphasise that the Children First Bill forms part of a suite of child protection legislation including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.</p></reply>

The objective is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which is expected to be published later this year, will address a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development,  play and recreation and issues surrounding supports for children with special needs. </p><p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education programme, which was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children before commencing primary school, includes a number of additional provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.</p><p>  I am aware that the Health Service Executive does, where possible, provide additional supports to children with special needs to enable them to avail of pre-school services in mainstream pre-school settings.  My Department has been working with the Department of Health in the context of building better supports to facilitate the inclusion of special needs children in mainstream pre-school settings.   However, the issue of supports for children with special needs availing of services in mainstream pre-school settings remains a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></reply>

The Centre incurred expenditure of &euro;2.022m in 2013 and received funding amounting to &euro;1.96m, resulting in a deficit of &euro;62,000. Projections by the Centre show that income of approximately &euro;1.8m is anticipated during 2014.  With such a level of financial support available it should be possible to work constructively to continue services and avoid the closure scenario that has previously been outlined by the Centre. </p><p>  Senior representatives from the Child and Family Agency, Pobal, Dublin City Childcare Committee and representatives from the board and management of the Centre have met on a number of occasions to explore options available to allow the service operate on a sustainable basis within the allocated funding. A number of options were considered and to assist in this process, Dublin City Childcare Committee engaged the services of an external mentor to undertake an independent detailed analysis of the matter.</p><p>  I understand that the external mentor will complete their report by mid July, 2014.  The objective is to ensure the development of a sustainable model of service delivery into the future. </p><p>  In parallel, a wider examination will be undertaken of the level and range of early years services supported by the State in the Darndale/Belcamp/Moatview area generally.   </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency, as one of a number of State funders of the Centre, agreed and has made additional pre-payments to the end of August.  This is in addition to previous pre-payments advanced for May and June.  </p><p>  I very much welcome the process of engagement which is in place and I hope that a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at which will ensure the continued operation of the Centre within the significant funding levels available.</p></reply>

The Quality Agenda provides an overdue recognition of the importance of promoting quality in early years settings in contrast to earlier decades where the predominant focus has been on the number of places and facilities available.</p><p>  A number of amendments were made to the Child Care Act 1991 in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 which completed its passage through the House at the end of last year.  Regulations to give effect to the legislative changes are expected to be published later this month.  At that point, a new registration system which will require childcare services to register with the Early Years Inspectorate in advance of opening, rather than simply notifying the Inspectorate of their existence, will be placed on a statutory basis.  This will require the Inspectorate to commence the assessment of the quality of a service before it opens.  Inspectors will also be able to impose conditions on services which, if not complied with, can result in de-registration.  In the meantime, services are being registered on an administrative basis, and all new services receive a pre-registration visit from the Early Years Inspectorate. </p><p>  The drafting of the regulations required a review of the draft National Standards and of the 2006 Regulations and the associated guidance document as well as input from Tusla, who have to implement new systems for implementing the new regulations.  Legal advice has informed the approach taken and I expect all matters to be finalised so as to allow for the making of regulations this month.</p><p>  Under the legislation, existing notified providers are deemed registered for a period of three years with a requirement to reapply for registration within three years.</p><p>  While very significant progress has been made, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will continue to build on the actions to date to continually improve quality in early years services. The Department will continue to progress the quality agenda, as well as continuing to support childcare provision through the current and targeted capital funding.  </p><p>  Some &euro;3 million in additional funding is being made available over 2014 and 2015 through a Learner Fund to support existing staff to achieve the new mandatory qualification requirements.  Over 2,200 staff have applied to have their training supported from this Fund and I welcome the strong commitment which this demonstrates on the part of staff and the wider sector to the Quality Agenda.  A new National Early Years Quality Support Service, employing 30 graduates in early childhood care and education, will commence providing mentoring support to services in October this year.  The promotion of higher and more consistent quality across all early years services will require sustained effort involving many different activities and actions.</p><p>  However, I welcome the widespread engagement withe National Early Years Quality Agenda which is evident from the range of initiatives being directed by my Department. </p></reply>

While I am anxious to improve the legal basis for access to adoption records, proposals to Government have to reflect the constraints on the Legislature in providing such access if they are not to fall foul of Constitutional challenge. The Office of the Attorney General has provided comprehensive legal advice to the Department that has assisted in identifying the Constitutional parameters within which the Heads of the Bill have to be drafted. The most difficult situations to address within the proposed legislation are those where the consent of other parties, such as natural mothers, does not exist for the release of information. </p><p>  It is intended to proceed to finalise legislative proposals so that I may bring proposals to the Government as soon as possible.  Subsequent consideration by the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee will allow the issues to be carefully teased out and the views of different interested parties on these important and sensitive matters to be fully considered.  </p><p>  In addition, improvements to existing procedures for the provision of adoption information and tracing services, which are provided nationally by the Child and Family Agency, are ongoing. A number of religious orders have transferred records from their Mother and Baby Homes and adoption societies to the Child and Family Agency.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records is underway. </p><p>  The importance of arrangements for the management of these records has been raised directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. </p><p>  I would urge birth mothers and those affected by adoption to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  The public attention this area is currently receiving provides the opportunity to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent for contact to be re-established.</p></reply>

The transfer of responsibility for 16 year old boys was implemented in May 2012 and this commitment under the programme for Government will be met in full later this year when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old males from the adult prison system to the children detention schools.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, is overseeing the delivery of the project with the contractor involved, BAM Building Limited. I understand there has been some weeks' delay in the construction programme due to weather and other issues but the OPW and the Department continue to emphasise the need to make up any time possible in order to meet the agreed project timeline for delivery of the first three units by the end of this year.</p><p>  The Working Group referred to by the Deputy was asked to compile a report on all issues arising from the planned transfer of responsibility for detention of 17 year old males from the prison system to the Oberstown campus.  The report of the Working Group has not been finalised as of yet but I am aware that many of the issues discussed by the working group are being progressed, including the building project, the recruitment of new care staff, the development of therapeutic services for young people, necessary legal provisions, security planning and communication between all affected agencies.  I expect to receive the report shortly. </p><p>  The position of 17 year old males on remand in St Patrick's Institution will be fully resolved when responsibility for all 17 year old males is transferred to the Oberstown campus later this year.  An interim proposal has been suggested which would involve the designation of Wheatfield Place of Detention as a remand centre under the Children Act 2001, pending the opening of the expanded facilities in Oberstown. The current position is that this proposal cannot be implemented for legal reasons.  However, I intend to discuss the matter further with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality after I have received and considered the Working Group report. </p></reply>

It is chaired by Dr Helen Buckley and is independent in its functions.  </p><p>The National Review Panel's individual and annual reports are published on the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s website and are available for the three year period between 2010 and 2012.  The latest <i>National Review Panel Annual Report 2</i>indicates that over the three year period it was notified of 60 deaths (22 in 2010; 15 in 2011 and 23 in 2012).  Further breakdown of cases reviewed indicate the following:</p><p>- Seven children were in care at the time of death (2 in 2010; 2 in 2011 and 3 in 2012),</p><p>- Eight were receiving aftercare services (4 in 2010; 2 in 2011 and 2 in 2012),</p><p>- Forty five were living with their family and known to child protection services (16 in 2010; 11 in 2011 and 18 in 2012).</p><p>The report further notes that the highest proportion of notified deaths between 2010 and 2012 concerned children or babies who died by natural causes.  The majority of these (9) were babies whose cause of death was sudden unexpected death in infancy.  The next most common cause for 8 children was complications due to congenital abnormalities, two children died from terminal cancer and two died from complications of serious illness.</p><p>Fourteen children and young people died unexpectedly from accidental causes, seven of which were road traffic incidents.  The remaining seven involved accidents of a different nature including fire, domestic accidents involving two small children and one older teenager and two outdoor accidents involving a drowning and a fall.  Six of the young people died from drug overdoses.  In all but one case the young person was found dead and toxicology reports indicated drug misuse.</p><p>What is alarming is that the largest number of unexpected deaths was from suicide.  In 2012 nine children and young people up to the age of 20 died by suicide.  One young person was in HSE care at the time of death having been known to HSE services for a very short period.  Three suicide victims were young adults in receipt of aftercare services. It is well acknowledged that adolescence can be a difficult time for some children but especially those who have experienced early adversity. These difficulties present across all areas of a child's life including health, education and in the community.  It is important that people working in these settings know how to identify and support children using a multi-agency approach for those who are experiencing difficulties.</p><p>As of December 2012, 24 National Review Panel reports have been published.  While the Panel reported on a number of management and practice weaknesses, there was no case where the review team concluded that action or inaction on the part of the HSE services was a direct contributory factor in the child or young person&rsquo;s death.  The report notes that many of its recommendations have been implemented.  My Department follows up recommendations made in the NRP reports to ensure they are in place. I am happy that the work of the National Review Panel is identifying areas where practice can be improved and the Agency's response.  </p><p>The reform programme of the Child and Family Agency is extensive.  The Agency's Business Plan for 2014 sets out in strategic terms the overall approach to be adopted by the Agency to the provision of child and family services and reflects a range of policy priorities which my predecessor communicated to the Agency last December.  The  Plan includes a particular focus on areas of service development and reform.  </p><p>My Department  has adopted a cross-Government and inter-agency approach to ensuring that we deliver a timely, comprehensive and integrated service to vulnerable children and families.  This will require the support and input of various departments and agencies to ensure that vulnerable children and families can access necessary services. </p></reply>

These announcements have been widely welcomed.</p><p>  The Commission of Investigation will be statutory and independent and will operate under the Commission of Investigations Act, 2004.

The report indicated that 196 children had died during this period of over 10 years.  This statistic was reported widely in the media and while the loss of any child is tragic it is important that further context is provided so that the number and causes of child deaths, particularly of children in care, is not exaggerated and that learning is taken and acted upon.  </p><p>The Report differentiated between categories of children (children in care at the time of death, young people over 18 receiving an aftercare service and children who had been referred to child protection and welfare services because of concerns but who were living at home).  It also differentiated between deaths from natural causes which were anticipated due to serious illness and disability and non-natural which included deaths related to substance abuse, suicide and accidents.</p><p>- 36 children were in care at the time of death (19 were deaths due to natural causes and 17 were non-natural)</p><p>- 32 young people were over the age of 18 and in receipt of aftercare services (5 deaths were due to natural causes and 27 were non-natural)</p><p>- 128 children were living at home but had been referred to child protection services due to concerns (60 deaths were due to natural causes and 68 were non-natural).</p><p>The Report made a number of recommendations for improvement including that any death of a child in care, aftercare or known to child protection services should be reviewed.</p><p>Later in 2010, a National Review Panel was established by the Health Service Executive (now the Child and Family Agency) based on guidance published by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The National Review Panel is independently chaired by Dr Helen Buckley, School of Social Work and Social Policy, Trinity College.  It is mandated to review all deaths and serious incidents involving children in care, aftercare and known to child protection services.  Its reports are published on the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s website and are available for the three year period between 2010 and 2012.  The latest <i>National Review Panel Annual Report 2012</i>indicates that at the end of 2012, the HSE had notified it of 60 deaths (22 in 2010; 15 in 2011 and 23 in 2012).  Further breakdown of cases reviewed by the National Review Panel indicate the following:</p><p>- Seven children were in care at the time of death (2 in 2010; 2 in 2011 and 3 in 2012),</p><p>- Eight were receiving aftercare services (4 in 2010; 2 in 2011 and 2 in 2012),</p><p>- 45 were living with their family and known to child protection services (16 in 2010; 11 in 2011 and 18 in 2012).</p><p>It is important that a factual and contextual account is provided for deaths of children in care or known to Child Welfare and Protection Services.  While it has been reported in the media recently that 23 children in care died in 2012, the facts are that:</p><p>- Three of the 23 children and young people were in the care of the HSE,</p><p>- Two of the 23 children and young people had been in receipt of after care services,</p><p>- Eighteen children and young adults (up to age 20) were living in their family homes with their parent/parents,</p><p>- 35% of children died of natural causes,</p><p>- 40% of the deaths reviewed were young people aged between 17 and 20 years and due to high risk behaviours,</p><p>- Younger children mainly died from natural causes and accidents.</p><p>As of December 2012, 24 National Review Panel reports have been published.  While the National Review Panel reported on a number of management and practice weaknesses, there was no case where the review team concluded that action or inaction on the part of the HSE services was a direct contributory factor in the child or young person&rsquo;s death.  The Panel's 2012 Annual Report notes that it found examples of positive practice at all levels in the majority of cases that it reviewed.  The report also notes that many of its recommendations in early reports are redundant in the context of the current reform of services including changes in management and governance and the establishment of the new Agency.  My Department follows up recommendations made in the National Review Panel reports to ensure they are implemented. I am happy that the work of the National Review Panel is identifying areas where practice can be improved and the Agency's response.

This reflected a long-standing practice where staff are sometimes required to work outside normal office hours in order to carry out their official duties, in most cases due to Oireachtas sittings.

I am aware of the UNHCR&rsquo;s estimates that more than 86,000 persons have left Myanmar/ Burma on boats since June 2012. I am also aware of the continuing problem of internally displaced peoples within Myanmar. Ireland together with EU partners calls on the Government of Myanmar/Burma to address the underlying causes of ethnic tensions in Rakhine State - between the ethnically distinct Muslim Rohinga population and the Buddhist Rakhine population - and guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar/Burma.  Ireland calls for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both communities. Economic integration and interdependency can be a vehicle for cooperation and peace between the communities. A longer-term Government strategy for rehabilitation and reconciliation is required.   The Irish Embassy in Vietnam, which is accredited to Myanmar/Burma, closely monitors developments, and, in September 2013, Ambassador Damien Cole travelled to Rakhine state to assess the situation on the ground.  Most recently, the Ambassador visited Naypyidaw on 23 May 2014 and met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  At that meeting he expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the situation of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state and humanitarian access to the region.</p><p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 May 2014, EU Foreign Ministers approved the establishment of a formal EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue. The first such Dialogue took place in Myanmar on 20 May. Discussions there touched on most topics of concern, in particular discrimination, hate speech and inter-communal violence against the Rohingyas in Rakhine, and in other parts of Myanmar. It also focused on political prisoners, land and labour rights, freedom of expression, and cooperation with international Human Rights mechanisms and in multilateral fora. </p><p>  At the dialogue, the EU stressed that continued efforts to achieve ethnic peace and to end discrimination and violence in Rakhine State were absolutely key for the success of Myanmar&rsquo;s continued transition to democracy. The EU encouraged the Myanmar government to address the underlying causes of inter-communal violence, including the status and welfare of the Rohingya and expressed regret that Rohingya could not self-identify during the recent census.  The EU also expressed readiness to cooperate with Myanmar on initiatives which promote inter-communal understanding. </p><p>  In March 2014, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted an EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, and urged the Government of Myanmar to step up its efforts to put an end to such remaining human rights violations and abuses. The resolution reiterated the Council&rsquo;s serious concern about the situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine State.</p><p>Previously, at the 23rd session of the UN Human Rights Council in May/June of 2013, Ireland and our fellow Council members urged the government there to grant full citizenship rights to the Rohingya in Rakhine, and review the 1982 citizenship law.</p><p>In relation to the UNHCR&rsquo;s call for temporary arrangements to be made for the Rohingya until the situation stabilises   in Rakhine, I would recall that in 2009 82 members of the Rohingya community were settled in Carlow and 5 others were settled in Dublin. The Rohingya had had only limited access to education in refugee and transit camps before arrival in Ireland but despite these disadvantages they are reported to have settled well. </p><p>  Currently, the EU is providing around 70 million Euro to the people of Rakhine State, most of which is used to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of the region. The EU will provide 688 million Euro in development aid to Myanmar over the period 2014-2020. The EU will also provide over 46 million Euro in funding to neighbouring states that have received Rohinga people fleeing from Rakhine due to inter-ethnic violence.</p><p>  Since 2007, over 7 million Euro has been provided by Irish Aid to NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long term development and emergency and recovery responses in Myanmar/Burma. In December 2013, I announced an additional programme of funding worth 500,000 Euro for a bilateral development assistance programme in 2013.  The same level of funding has also been agreed for 2014.   Trocaire have also received 425,825 Euro in funding in 2014 from Irish Aid under the Humanitarian Programme Plan for Food Security, Livelihood and Protection assistance programme in Laiza, Kachin State, Myanmar.</p></reply>

Notably, and very positively, Brazil has developed and delivered policies that have lifted an estimated 40 million people from poverty. Large sporting events such as the World Cup have enormous potential to benefit widely the societies in which they take place and this has increasingly become a consideration for host countries, as the positive experience of the 2012 London Olympics has shown.  Brazil has, from the beginning, taken a pro-active stand with regard to spreading the benefits of the World Cup, including through the choice of 12 host cities in order to ensure that the benefits of hosting the tournament would not be confined only to wealthier and more developed regions of the country.  It is also my understanding that 100,000 free tickets have been made available to public school students, indigenous communities and the construction workers who helped to build the new stadiums.</p><p>  The Brazilian Government&rsquo;s projections are that the 2014 World Cup will increase the country&rsquo;s GDP by almost 10 billion Euro and that, as well as investments in the match stadiums, the World Cup has led to an acceleration of investment in roads, airports and urban mobility projects, including public transportation, new urban roads, bus rapid transit and light rail vehicle systems.  The World Cup is also expected to generate significant employment and revenue in Brazil&rsquo;s tourism sector.  </p><p>  Brazil has a strong civil society sector with many non-governmental organisations operating within the country.  These civil society organisations advocate on behalf of and provide support to marginalised sections of society such as minorities, people affected by disabilities and by poverty. Since the establishment of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Brazil fourteen years ago, Ireland has provided development assistance to small&ndash;scale development projects in poor and disadvantaged areas. </p><p>  Funding of almost &euro;3.3million has been channelled in the past five years through Irish Aid, the Government&rsquo;s overseas development assistance programme, to support various development projects implemented by civil society organisations.  This funding has been provided primarily through the Civil Society Fund (CSF) and In Country Micro Projects Scheme (ICMPS).  The CSF supports Irish and invited international NGOs to undertake small-scale development projects, whilst the ICMPS enables Embassies and Consulates in countries without a bilateral Irish Aid programme to directly support micro projects addressing the root causes of poverty and injustice.  Funding has also been channelled through Misean Cara which provides support for Irish missionary congregations involved in development work.  Such congregations are actively engaged in a wide range of development work, focused, in Brazil, primarily on social justice, urban community and education initiatives.</p></reply>

The policy also reaffirms our commitment to providing &ldquo;aid that is not conditional on procurement of goods and services from Ireland&rdquo;<i>.  </i>All of Ireland&rsquo;s aid to developing countries is 100 per cent untied. The principle of untied aid is a core feature of the work to make aid effective, and Ireland&rsquo;s policy and performance have been recognised internationally, including by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Development assistance is most effective when it supports the objectives that people, communities and Governments set themselves as priorities for national development and the fight to end poverty and hunger.  Delivering development assistance as untied aid to developing countries is the best way to ensure that poor countries gain control over their own destiny and that all development resources, both external and internal, can be used coherently and provide the best value for money.  Evidence has shown that the &ldquo;tying&rdquo; of aid can increase the costs of development projects by as much as 15-30%.</p><p>While the Government remains committed to ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s official aid is fully untied, we are determined to explore synergies between our aid programme and sectors where Irish companies have particular expertise or comparative advantage. Irish companies can, of course, bid on Irish Aid funded projects as part of international competitive bidding processes. Through our Embassies in our partner countries, we work to identify areas where cooperation between Irish Aid and Irish industry can yield benefits for our development partners.  This approach is central to my Department&rsquo;s Africa Strategy which seeks to expand our ties with African countries, developing relationships that include strengthened trade, investment, and people-to-people links.</p></reply>

Ministers were briefed on the current situation by the new Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, who presented his President&rsquo;s peace plan and called for our support. In our conclusions, we welcomed the plan as a major chance for de-escalation and commended President Poroshenko&rsquo;s determined actions towards peace and stability in Ukraine since his inauguration. We also called on the Russian Federation to support the peace plan and adopt effective measures to stop the continued flow of illegal fighters, arms and equipment over the border into Ukraine.  We encouraged the Ukrainian authorities to continue their reform efforts, including as regards constitutional and decentralisation reforms, the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, the reform of the judiciary, fight against corruption and improving the business climate.</p><p>The Council conclusions also reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s strong condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.<i></i>The FAC decided to prohibit the import into the EU of goods originating from Crimea or Sevastopol with the exception of those with a certificate of origin issued by the Government of Ukraine. The Council called on the European External Action Service and the Commission to continue to monitor the situation, and to present further measures, as necessary. We also urged UN member states to consider similar measures, in line with UN General Assembly Resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 concerning the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p><p>Importantly, the Council conclusions also re-affirmed the EU&rsquo;s support for the work of the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission and agreed to establish a CSDP mission to assist Ukraine in the field of civilian security sector reform, including policing and the rule of law. I welcome these positive developments.</p><p>The Council expressed its regret that talks, facilitated by the European Commission, relating to the supply of gas from the Russian Federation to Ukraine have so far been inconclusive and urged both sides to reach an agreement as soon as possible.</p><p>On possible further sanctions, the Council recalled that the Commission, European External Action Service and the Member States have been undertaking preparatory work on possible targeted measures so that further steps can be taken should events in Eastern Ukraine so require.</p><p>Since the FAC, the Association Agreement with Ukraine was signed on 27 June on the margins of the European Council, representing an important symbol of the EU&rsquo;s continued commitment and support, and providing further impetus to political and economic reform efforts.

The format and programme for the 2016 commemoration in Dublin is still under consideration.  In September 2013, in my speech to the British-Irish Association, I noted a responsibility to be attentive and respectful of all traditions on this island in our approach to the decade of commemorations.  In that spirit of inclusion, I expressed the hope that the Government would host representatives of the British Royal Family and the British Government, along with leaders of Irish unionism, in Dublin to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising.  The commemoration will be a unique opportunity to promote Ireland internationally.  In that context, the attendance of Ireland&rsquo;s international partners, including representatives from Britain, will be considered in the coming period.</p></reply>

The essential issues behind the breakdown were the profound lack of trust between the two sides, insufficient political commitment, particularly by the Israeli Government, to reaching an agreement, and the continued and indeed accelerated expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory throughout the period of the negotiations.</p><p>  These are of course not new problems, and we have discussed them many times here in the Oireachtas, and indeed in the EU at the Foreign Affairs Council.</p><p>  I have called for a substantial review by the EU of its policies and levers on the Middle East issue, and I hope this will begin at the July Foreign Affairs Council. Such a review is clearly critical if we are to maintain the prospect of a viable, two-State solution.</p><p>  The EU should of course continue to give what support and encouragement it can to a resumption of negotiations, which are the only way to reach a solution. But negotiations for their own sake are of no use, there must be a real commitment to find agreement on the core issues and to make the difficult compromises that inevitably will be involved.</p><p>  In my view, the EU should therefore use the influence and leverage at its disposal to give effect to its disapproval of various negative aspects of Israel&rsquo;s continued occupation and policies on the ground, and above all the relentless expansion of settlements. This would build on existing measures such as the non-eligibility of settlement goods for lower tariffs, and the exclusion of settlements from EU research funding.</p><p>  One element of that leverage should be the issuing of EU guidelines on labelling of settlement goods. This has been promised at EU level, but was left to one side for the moment while the talks were in progress, for fear of damaging the political atmosphere. We should now look again at moving ahead with publishing such guidelines, along the lines already followed by some Member States. If they remain stalled at EU level, I have already stated that we will be prepared instead to issue national guidelines.</p></reply>

The issue of a passport is, therefore, the culmination of an important and legally-binding process.  The checks and balances within the passport process embrace the standard principles that are provided for in the Act and help to ensure that the person in question is an Irish citizen <i>and</i>that the identity of the applicant is known.  This serves to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which, in turn, ensures the safe travel and wellbeing of Irish citizens, as they travel abroad.  Moreover, it helps to combat passport and identity fraud.The Act underpins a long-standing passport policy in regard to the use of verifiable civil documents such civil birth certificates for first-time applicants.  These documents confirm the details of a person&rsquo;s birth name, date and place of birth, all of which are critical components of a person&rsquo;s identity.  The Passport Service received an application from the person in question on 20/06/2012.  As part of the standard examination processes, the birth certificate supplied by the applicant was found not to be authentic.  The applicant subsequently produced another birth certificate which has also been confirmed as not a genuine document.  In the circumstances the Passport Service could not be satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and as a result, the application for an Irish passport could not be approved.  The matter has been referred to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>The Passport Service is not questioning the procedures regarding the issuing of naturalisation certificates by the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  Rather, the Passport Service is following the requirements of the Passport Act 2008 to verify the identity of the applicant i.e. that the person who has submitted the application is who they claim to be.  This is the same process followed for all first time applicants e.g. the presentation of an Irish birth certificate alone as obtained from the General Register Office is not acceptable without other forms of identity documents.  These are normal processes and are in place for the purposes of mitigating the risk not only of potential passport fraud, but also to protect against attempts at identity theft.</p></reply>

It also agreed that the Eurogroup would examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.</p><p>  Since June 2012, we have successfully negotiated the Promissory Notes transaction; a further extension of maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans; and the inclusion of a provision for retroactive recapitalisation on a case by case basis in the operational framework of the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument.</p><p>  In February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State, including spreading the cost of the Promissory Notes from a weighted average life of c.7-8 years to c.34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings.</p><p>  In April 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022. This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability. It also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing by creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.</p><p>  There has also been progress on the ESM Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI). The Eurogroup meeting on 20th June 2013 agreed on the main features of the DRI. There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.</p><p>  On 10 June 2014 the euro area Member States reached a preliminary agreement on the European Stability Mechanism's (ESM) direct recapitalisation instrument (DRI). This now requires a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty and the aim is to have this process completed by November this year. This would allow the ESM DRI to come into effect once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational which is expected to be in November of this year.</p><p>  All of these actions are tangible achievements which reduce the burden of Ireland's national debt.</p></reply>

The restructured credit is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and also includes the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to the higher rate of income tax arises. However, the credit is more targeted in that it is, in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child. A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child or children is unsustainable.</p><p>  The new credit is designed to be an activation measure, which was the original intention behind the OPFTC. It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment. It should not be considered as a supplementary source of income, on which the financial support of a parent depends.</p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the OPFTC played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents. However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.</p><p>  The person who receives the child benefit payment is being used as the initial indicator by the Revenue Commissioners to identify the individuals who are likely to qualify for the new credit.  However, the credit will in the first place go to the person who cares for the child for most of the year. Agreement as to who will be the principal carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians.</p><p>  You appear to be suggesting that the credit could be jointly shared between the parents. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that this would prove to be administratively very difficult to implement even where there is agreement among the parents, which is not often the case. In addition, as income and tax arrangements are prone to change it would require that the issue be revisited on at least an annual basis to ensure the correct tax treatment is being apportioned to each party. While a 50/50 split may suit some taxpayers it would not suit others and determining the exact split for a large number of taxpayers would place an unacceptable administrative burden on the Revenue Commissioners. However, as a result of an amendment that I brought to the measure at Committee Stage, the current legislation allows the parents to agree among themselves to each claim the credit on alternate years provided they meet the qualifying criteria.</p><p>  It is essential to regularly review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  While I understand the difficulties being experienced by those that have lost the OPFTC and who have not qualified for the new SPCCC, I am satisfied that the new credit targets limited Exchequer resources to where they are needed most.</p></reply>

Under the current text Member States will be required to ensure the beneficial ownership information on corporate and other legal entities, and trusts is held in a specified location so that it can be accessed in a timely manner.  In fact there are already provisions in place which allow for enforcement authorities and other shareholders to identify beneficial owners of companies when required. Furthermore trusts are subject to robust reporting requirements under current taxation and anti-money laundering legislation.</p><p>  The new Directive will inter alia require amendment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 and we await final agreement of the specific provisions in the text with the European Parliament before commencing with the cross-Departmental transposition work.</p></reply>

The low level of construction and lack of mobility in the housing market  as well as statistics on the disparity between mortgage approvals and drawdowns combine to illustrate housing market supply issues in urban areas particularly in the Dublin region. My Department monitors and reviews these, and other, indicators on a regular basis.  As referred to in my previous response of 17 June, the Government's Construction Strategy includes, within the broad policy framework, a desire for a return to sustainable levels of mortgage lending as part of a healthy market.  A key aspect is to ensure that sufficient confidence is in place to facilitate development and that customers will be capable of accessing finance to purchase new build homes. This means mortgage products being available to potential purchasers with an ability to support repayments but mortgage lending decisions must be taken on a sustainable and prudent basis by the financial institutions conforming fully to regulatory requirements both in relation to the lending institution and also having regard to the safeguarding of the borrower's interests.</p></reply>

It also agreed that the Eurogroup would examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme. </p><p>  The ESM Treaty entered into force on 27 September 2012,  in accordance with Article 48.1 of the ESM Treaty, following ratification by euro area Member States representing over 99.8% of its subscribed capital base. The European Stability Mechanism Act 2012 provides for Ireland's membership of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and payments into it.

This means that payments towards its paid-in capital have no impact on the general government deficit.

The threshold had previously been set at &euro;5 million. This change was implemented to ensure that NAMA could operate to the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in the management of its loan portfolio and allow for the completion of all NAMA transfers by end-year 2010. It was considered at the time that smaller loans below this threshold would be better managed through the banks  branch networks and through local banking relationships.  The decision to raise the threshold from &euro;5 million to &euro;20 million for the transfer of loans from AIB and Bank of Ireland to NAMA reduced the total volume of NAMA eligible loans by &euro;6.6 billion.   I have no plans to revist this decision at this time. </p></reply>

RBS is currently reviewing the operations of Ulster Bank in Ireland with a view to creating a sustainable business model and on 27 February 2014 RBS re-iterated its commitment to the Irish market. As part of its strategic review process RBS announced plans in late 2013 to accelerate the deleveraging of assets contained in RBS Capital Resolution, a material amount of which are assets held by Ulster Bank.  </p><p>  It is good news that the bank has committed so firmly to the Irish market. Officials in the Department of Finance have been in contact with both RBS and Ulster Bank officials and this will continue as the bank finalises its plans for the future.</p><p>  With regard to Permanent TSB, the Deputy will recall that a way forward was agreed with the Troika in April 2012 which envisaged it playing an important role in the future of Irish retail banking, being a more focused retail bank bringing an element of competition to the marketplace which has consolidated significantly since 2008.  </p><p>  While no restructuring plan has been approved, Permanent TSB has made significant progress in delivering key elements of the Restructuring Plan and the business is being managed structurally in the way envisaged in the plan. Permanent TSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investments through the continued delivery of the Restructuring Plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of Permanent TSB.  </p><p>  During 2013 Permanent TSB grew its presence and activity in the retail market in general and in the current account and deposit markets in particular, as well as in mortgages and term lending; and it launched several new products during the year.  Permanent TSB has also made material progress in relation to managing its portfolio of mortgages in arrears. </p><p>  The strategy for Permanent TSB is to be an independent bank, competing within targeted segments of the retail banking market, and I will continue to support the board and management in the delivery of that strategy.</p><p>  While I am strongly supportive of Permanent TSB in the delivery of their strategy I cannot discount the possibility that a strategic transaction could arise opportunistically at any time involving Permanent TSB which could be in the best interests of the State.  As part of their day-to-day role my officials will consider all credible proposals and develop strategic options relating to our banking investments.  </p><p>  As I have stated previously in addition to the many initiatives the Government is undertaking relating to non-bank credit I would like to see more competition in the domestic banking system to provide the lending required for our growing economy and that as part of that process I would welcome the participation of foreign banks in Ireland, possibly by way of partnership with some of our domestic banks. </p><p>  Separately a strategic review of NAMA is underway under section 227 of the NAMA Act 2009. As part of this review I am examining and will be discussing with NAMA a range of potential strategic alternatives to take advantage of current market conditions  . I intend to lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  </p></reply>

Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.  Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. </p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs was unsustainable. If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the recent reform, the tax system is still supporting those who can afford private medical insurance to the tune of around &euro;400 million per annum. Effectively that means that some taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are continuing to provide financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.  </p><p>  It is unfair and unsustainable to allow unrestricted tax relief on private medical insurance premiums, particularly at a time when the general population has contributed so much to repairing the public finances. However, the new ceilings ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base, and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer, including state pensions.  </p><p>  An individual is not liable to pay USC where his or her total income does not exceed &euro;10,036. All State contributory and non-contributory pensions are exempt from the charge. In addition, if a retired person's income (not counting the state pension) is below the exemption threshold, they are not liable for the USC. Furthermore, individuals aged 70 and over, and medical card holders, benefit from a lower rate of USC (provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000). </p><p>  As a result of a review of the USC conducted by my Department in 2011, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  </p><p>  As part of the normal budgetary preparations, my officials will examine potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package. However, it should be borne in mind that under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, until Ireland has reached its objective of a balanced budget in structural terms, we may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.</p></reply>

Specifically, as LPT is a self-assessed tax it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on an assessment of the market value of the property.  </p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that it published extensive guidelines on how to value a property for the purposes of LPT at the time of the 2013 'bulk issue' of Returns to property owners. The guidelines included the booklet 'Your Guide to Local Property Tax', which was inserted with the Returns that issued. The guidelines clearly stated that LPT as a self-assessed tax required property owners to honestly assess the value of their residential property on the valuation date of 1 May 2013, taking into account issues such as the type and age of the property and its state of repair.  Once the valuation of the property was confirmed, the property owner was required to select the Property Valuation Band most applicable to the property and to pay the amount due. The Property Band system removes any requirement to calculate a precise valuation figure and on that basis it was anticipated that for the most part change requests in respect of valuations would not occur.</p><p>  The valuation, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and is not affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or by any repairs or improvements made to the property during this period. Owners will have the opportunity to re-assess the declared value of the property on the next valuation date, which is 1 November 2016. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the Property Band system, where a property owner has genuinely over-valued and over-paid LPT, then Section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides that a claim for a refund of the overpaid tax can be made to Revenue subject to certain conditions being satisfied. The normal conditions require the property owner to make a submission setting out fully the nature of the error or mistake and explaining the circumstances in which the overpayment arose. Any such submission must include relevant supporting documentation such as professional valuations or relevant house price surveys for the area. The property owner should also indicate whether he/she relied on Revenue's valuation guidance for the purposes of the self-assessment.</p><p>  In regard to the case to which the Deputy refers, I am informed by Revenue that a daughter of the person in question completed the LPT Return on his behalf on 21 May 2013 and clearly indicated Band 4 as the appropriate Valuation Band for the property. The associated Band 4 liability of &euro;202 (half year) was also paid at that time. </p><p>  The person subsequently paid his 2014 liability at a Band 2 rate of &euro;225 (full year) and submitted a request to have the original Band 4 rate decreased to Band 2. As already stated, any such request must be supported with back up documentation and while some additional information was provided it was not adequate to support a reduction of 2 Valuation Bands. I am advised that a member of the LPT team actually discussed this issue with a staff member from the Deputy's office on 13 June. The LPT official specifically confirmed that the proposed reduction from Band 4  to Band 2 would not be reflective of the valuations applied in the general geographic area and that the information supplied by the person supporting such a reduction was not comparing 'like with like'. </p><p>  However, the Deputy's comment in regard to the person's low income is noted.

The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.</p><p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 is allowed on a tax-neutral basis   the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual's marginal rate on the way in and are taxed at the individual's marginal rate on withdrawal. The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant. The measure is, however, designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs have to date decided to preserve their AVC pension savings. For these various reasons, I have no plans to extend pre-retirement access to pension savings beyond what is provided for in relation to AVCs.</p></reply>

In this regard I am assured that Revenue debt management caseworkers are very conscious of the challenges that exist for some taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations in a timely manner. For that reason the caseworkers will always seek to work proactively with taxpayers and viable businesses that engage positively to agree mutually satisfactory arrangements to overcome temporary cashflow difficulties in preference to deploying enforcement options. However, where a business or taxpayer fails to meaningfully engage with Revenue, then I am fully supportive of the deployment of the necessary collection and enforcement measures to secure the taxes and duties due to the Exchequer.</p><p>One of the enforcement powers available to Revenue to ensure timely tax collection is Attachment. This power is covered in legislation under Section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended. Section 1002 allows Revenue to either directly remove funds from any account held by a financial institution in the name of a defaulting taxpayer, or, to instruct any third party that owes a debt to the defaulting taxpayer to pay those funds directly to Revenue.</p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that it never deploys its enforcement powers, including Attachment, without giving the taxpayer every opportunity to engage and agree mutually acceptable solutions, including phased payment arrangements. The enforcement process only commences when the caseworker has exhausted all other options to encourage voluntary compliance. Revenue also has strict guidelines in place, including authorisation at a senior level, to ensure Attachment is only used in appropriate circumstances.</p><p>Revenue is always conscious that the use of Attachment Orders can have adverse consequences for taxpayers and it is normally only deployed where other enforcement options have failed to secure the outstanding debt.</p><p>In regard to the specific data requested by the Deputy, the number and value of Attachment Orders issued by Revenue and  the amounts collected on foot of those Orders in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 (to date), and the number that are currently active, is set out in the table in the following appendix.</p><p><b>Appendix : Attachment Orders</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Cases</th><th>Number of Referrals</th><th>Value of Referrals (&euro;m)</th><th>Yield (&euro;m)</th><th>No. of Attachments Currently Active</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>N/A</td><td>4,463</td><td>213</td><td>30.7</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2,903</td><td>4,039</td><td>178.5</td><td>28.5</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2,989</td><td>4,199</td><td>173.5</td><td>28.6</td><td>352</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (YTD)</td><td>1,544</td><td>1,972</td><td>65.2</td><td>11</td><td>424</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In Finance Act 2010, mortgage interest relief was extended up to end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after.  Therefore, tax relief will continue to be available in respect of interest paid by an individual on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, regardless of whether they are considered first-time buyers or non-first-time buyers.</p><p>  Single individuals that are first-time buyers qualify for Mortgage Interest Relief up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 for the first seven years of their mortgage.  Thereafter relief is restricted to a ceiling of &euro;3,000.</p><p>  This Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008. In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. This was the period during which house prices peaked.</p><p>  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period. In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year.</p><p>  The arrangements and qualifying conditions for mortgage interest relief are publicised widely whenever changes to the system are made in the Budget and are published on the Revenue website.</p><p>  In addition to the above, the legislation governing the administration of Local Property Tax (LPT) provides for a number of exemptions from LPT for those who purchased a residential property from 1 January 2013.</p><p>  Section 8 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides an exemption from LPT to a property purchased between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013 if it is occupied as a sole or main residence by the purchaser.</p><p>  Under section 9 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) any new and previously unused residential property that is purchased from a builder or property developer between 1 January 2013 and 31 October 2016 will be exempt from LPT up to the end of 2016.</p><p>  Furthermore, any residential property that was not a liable property for LPT purposes on the 1 May 2013, for example where the construction was not completed, will not be liable for LPT until 2017. Where such a property is purchased after 1 May 2013, it will not be liable for LPT until 2017.</p><p>  However, if a person purchased a property that was liable to LPT on 1 May 2013 between 1 January and 1 November 2014 then they will be liable to LPT for 2015 and 2016.</p></reply>

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up repayments on a mortgage loan which is secured on a primary residence are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty.  In order to ensure that engagement between lender and borrower is facilitated, the current version of the CCMA puts a greater emphasis on a more qualitative approach to contacts and the previous limit of three unsolicited contacts per month is replaced by a requirement for the lender to draw up a board approved contacts policy.</p><p>With regard to the level of communications from a lender to a borrower, the CCMA now provides that: </p><p>Provision 21. A lender must produce and implement a policy regarding <b>communication</b>s with <b>borrower</b>s. That policy must be approved by the board of directors and must ensure that the requirements of Provision 22 are met. </p><p>Provision 22. A lender must ensure that: </p><p>a) the level of <b>communication</b>s from the lender, or any third party acting on its behalf, is proportionate and not excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the <b>borrower</b>s, including that unnecessarily frequent <b>communication</b>s are not made; </p><p>b) <b>communication</b>s with <b>borrower</b>s are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing; </p><p>c) <b>borrower</b>s are given sufficient time to complete an action they have committed to before follow up <b>communication </b>is attempted. In deciding what constitutes sufficient time, consideration must be given to the action that a <b>borrower </b>has committed to carry out, including whether he/she may require assistance from a third party in carrying out the action; and </p><p>d) steps are taken to agree future <b>communication </b>with <b>borrower</b>s. </p><p>Communication is defined, in the CCMA, as &quot;the imparting or exchanging of information between a lender and a borrower by speaking, on paper or another durable medium, or using any other medium.  In addition, a lender must maintain records of all communications with borrowers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears including recordings of all Arrears Support Unit telephone calls made to or from a borrower in relation to his/her arrears or pre-arrears.  The intention of this provision is to strengthen protection for borrowers by facilitating compliance monitoring.</p><p>If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think they are not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at .</p></reply>

Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States.</p><p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst the Member States, including some of the participating Member States. These concerns have led to the recent issuing of a communique by the participating Member States, announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives. However, significant technical and legal discussions will continue to be required at the Council Working Party before the text of the proposed Directive can be finalised. With this in mind, the targeted implementation date for the FTT has been rescheduled to 1 January 2016.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland already has a tax on certain financial transactions - a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies - which currently stands at 1%.  The yield from this charge in 2013 was &euro;251 million.</p></reply>

While a small number of such secretaries remain in schools, the scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant arrangement. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and/or caretaking) services. The flexible nature of the capitation grant schemes allows individual school authorities to apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services to meet their needs. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established involving my Department, the Department of Finance (now Public Expenditure and Reform), IMPACT and SIPTU with a view to establishing the factual position in schools regarding terms and conditions (including pay) of school secretaries and caretakers and commencing discussions on the proposal of the unions that an interim minimum pay rate should be introduced. It should be noted that the forum was established with specific terms of reference and was not intended to be a general industrial relations forum dealing with all employment related issues for school secretaries and caretakers.</p><p>  The first aspect of the forum's tasks was completed. It was not possible to begin discussions on the second element (introduction of a minimum pay rate) due to the State's serious budgetary and financial position, as the introduction of such a rate would inevitably involve an increased cost to the Exchequer. However, it was agreed that the forum would consider appropriate measures in relation to the rates of pay of school secretaries and caretakers in the event that a review of the Public Service Agreements recommended changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum.</p></reply>

While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, eligibility for school transport is to the nearest school or education centre.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only subject to a number of terms and conditions including the payment of the annual charge. This charge, which may be paid in two instalments in July and December, is a contribution towards the overall cost and does not reflect the true cost of providing these services.  Only children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from paying the annual charge.  The terms of the School Transport Schemes are applied equitably on a national basis and I am satisfied with the current criteria for determining eligibility.</p></reply>

While this Department sets out the constitution of Boards of Management and rules of procedure it is not directly involved in the management of schools. Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school, and it is the Board of Management which employs the teachers at the school.  Accordingly, whereas the Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, the Department does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases. If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies.</p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions of a school recognised by the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions of a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child. The office can be contacted at: Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1; tel. 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 865 6800 or email oco@oco.ie.</p><p>  The Department website www.education.ie is a useful source of information. The section dealing with parental complaints, bullying and child protection is www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Complaints-Bullying-Child-Protection-Discrimination.  In accordance with the Department's child protection procedures, I can confirm that the correspondence received was referred without judgment to the relevant authorities.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools. These new procedures have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and replace guidelines that were issued to schools in 1993. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p></reply>

My Department published Circular 0009/2012 &ndash; Staffing Arrangements in post-primary schools for the 2012/13 school year in February, 2012 to inform all post primary school management of the staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year and in particular, of the requirement to manage guidance from within the standard allocation with effect from the 2012/13 school year.

For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will develop during their junior cycle, requires that all students will "value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context".  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include "working with others" whereby students should realise and experience how they can "contribute to making the world a better place". As junior cycle students will experience the statements of learning and key skills, it is expected that education for active citizenship will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle.</p><p>  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). This short course will be available to schools to implement, from this September, should they wish to do so as part of their Junior Cycle programme or they may continue to offer the current syllabus. Schools will choose from one or the other for the up-coming academic year 2014/2015. The new short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities. It is also important to note that the new CSPE short course is designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.</p></reply>

Among the recommendations, were those relating to areas of stable population.  The Report recommended that in such areas, where there is evidence of demand for different types of patronage, this demand could be met by divesting patronage of existing schools.</p><p>  As part of the implemenation of these recommendations, surveys of parental preferences in 43 such areas were undertaken and sufficient parental demand for a wider choice of school patron emerged in 28 of the areas.  The demand demonstrated was for English medium multidenominational education in 27 of these areas, while one area demonstrated demand for an Irish-language national school (35 of the 43 areas surveyed already have a Gaelscoil option available).</p><p>  Following discussions with the existing Catholic patrons on the potential for permanent accommodation options and discussions with Educate Together on their priorities for initial start-up areas, three new multi-denominational schools will open in September 2014. In addition, the transfer of patronage of a Church of Ireland school to Educate Together patronage from September 2014 in one survey area is also being advanced.  A fifth multi-denominational school that opened in temporary accommodation in September 2014 is moving to an Edmund Rice Schools Trust building for September 2014.  The engagement with patrons so far has been positive and it is expected that further progress can be achieved for new schools in 2015 and onwards.  It is my intention to publish shortly a paper outlining progress in relation to this and other recommendations made by the Forum.</p></reply>

This report is available at www.ncse.ie.  The report has recommended that a new allocation model should be developed for schools based on two components: a school educational profile component; and a baseline component provided to every mainstream school to support inclusion, prevention of learning difficulties and early intervention.  It recommended that the educational profile of a school should take into account: the number of students with complex special educational needs attending the school; the Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results; the Social context of school which includes gender, primary school location and educational disadvantage.</p><p>  I have asked my Department to consider the recommendations contained in this report and to examine what impact this proposal would have in practice on the allocation of Special Needs teachers to schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy in his question.  I am hopeful that this work, which involves collecting significant information from schools, can be completed by the Autumn, following which, further consideration will be given to the report recommendations.  In considering proposals for any new resource allocation model my Department will consult with all stakeholder groups, including parents, to hear their views on the proposals.</p></reply>

The most recent information available relates to March 2014 when a total of 282 retired teachers were employed by the managerial authorities of schools. One hundred and forty nine retired primary teachers and one hundred and thirty three retired voluntary secondary and community and comprehensive teachers were employed. However, seventy per cent of those teachers worked 5 days or less. By comparision in March 2013 a total of 362 retired teachers were employed by the managerial authorities. Two hundred and eight retired primary teachers and one hundred and fifty four retired voluntary secondary and community and comprehensive teachers were employed.  In that period eighty five per cent worked 5 days or less.</p><p>  The policy of my Department is to ensure, as far as possible, that the managerial authorities of schools give priority to unemployed registered teachers who are fully qualified when filling vacant teaching posts.  My Department has issued a number of circulars addressing this issue in recent years. Under the terms of these circulars school Principal's must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have to engage a registered teacher who is retired. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.</p><p>  A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale. Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable.  These measures represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  The NCSE have announced that in September there will be over 10,900 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts in schools to support students with special needs for the 2014/2015 school year.  The exact numbers of SNAs will become clear when enrolments of students in mainstream schools are finalised in September.  A school by school breakdown of SNA allocations for 2014/15 school year is available at www.ncse.ie.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is a matter for each individual school to determine its own policy in relation to the literature or information that is sent home with its pupils.  However, in my view it is not appropriate for any school to distribute letters from, or on behalf of, public representatives to the school community.  Where a parent has a concern in relation to any material being circulated by a school, the matter should be raised with the relevant school authority. </p></reply>

These stakeholders included parents, teachers, principals, health professionals, school management bodies, Department of Education and Skills staff (National Educational Psychological Service staff, Inspectors), special educational needs organisers (SENOs), advocacy groups, and teacher union officials.

My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  36 small schools that were due to lose a classroom post in September are provisionally retaining it on the basis of their appeal.  The final position will be known in the Autumn when 30 September 2014 actual enrolments are confirmed.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures.  I am mindful of the concerns of smaller schools and rural schools.  Our overall primary school enrolment has been growing rapidly in recent years and this is going to continue.  In managing the resource consequences of this, it is important that decisions on school provision and organisation are based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.</p><p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review.  This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type.  I am currently considering this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-01a.375.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070100059#WRG03000"><p>It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a source of revenue, and the rating system generally, are deeply embedded in the local government system.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  All rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in delivering the public services which are required locally to create the environment in which businesses can prosper.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation (ARV) they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.  Rates are a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.  A system having regard to economic factors such as fluctuations in supply and demand, inherent in the property letting market on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.</p><p>  The levying of rates on commercial property by reference to movements in the letting market rather than valuation would be a significant change and a departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates by reference to property values.  The introduction of such a system for rating purposes would not be suitable because supply and demand in the property market can vary significantly from year to year and within and between the various business sectors which would lead to an unstable and volatile valuation base.  Therefore, I have no plans to change the method by which valuations are assessed for rating as such a radical move would represent a significant  departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates solely by reference to property values.</p><p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 provides for two key elements in the provision and maintenance of the valuation lists for rating - revision and revaluation.  The revision process provides for the updating of valuation lists so that new properties can  be valued and added to the list, improved and extended properties can have their valuations updated and properties that have been demolished in whole or in part can have their valuations amended or struck out as appropriate.</p><p>  Under the current provisions of the Act, an owner/occupier of an individual business premises who has concerns about the valuation of their property or any part thereof, including its rateability or the method of calculation may, on payment of a statutory fee of &euro;250, apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  A Revision Officer is then appointed, who may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC) has occurred since the property was last revised.  MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition, however, does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as road or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.</p><p>  The revaluation provisions in the Act provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as road or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system - distributing the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  Following revaluation, there will generally be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy. It is not the purpose of revaluation to increase the total amount of rates collected by local authorities.  In fact, the relevant legislation (Valuation Act, 2001 and the Local Government Business (Improvements Districts) Act, 2006 provides that the commercial rates income of local authorities in the year following revaluation is capped.</p><p>  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible.  The revaluation programme began in November, 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas and more recently to the Dublin City and Waterford City and County Council areas.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December, 2007; Fingal was completed in 2009; Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010 and Dublin City and Waterford City and County were completed in December, 2013.  The revaluation of Limerick City and County area is currently underway.  While the Commissioner is exploring a number of initiatives to accelerate the programme, he cannot at present give a date for the commencement of the revaluation of all commercial properties in County Kerry or in other rating authority areas</p></reply>

The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000.</p><p>The Office of Government Procurement who administers the eTenders website has advised that since January 2012 that the company, which is the subject of the Deputy's question, has not been awarded an above threshold contract.  The management of a public works contract is a matter between a contracting authority and a main contractor.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that contractors comply with all the requirements of the contract.  If the Deputy is aware of any non-compliance he should contact the relevant contracting authority directly.</p></reply>

The first stage of the procurement process for a civil works contractor to undertake the works has been commenced by Cork County Council, which is the Contracting Authority for the Scheme. Tender documents are likely to be issued to a shortlisted number of contractors in early August with a contractor expected to be appointed in late 2014, subject to Confirmation of the Scheme i.e. formal approval by my Department as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts.</p><p>  In relation to Clonakilty, consultants appointed by OPW are currently working towards developing viable options for a flood relief scheme. </p><p>  A second Public Consultation will take place on 2 July, 2014 in Clonakilty to provide an opportunity for members of the public to give their views on the direction the scheme is taking. The OPW expects to be in a position to present the preferred option at the statutory Public Exhibition of the scheme in the Autumn. </p><p>  Following the Public Exhibition, the detailed design of the scheme will commence and once this has been completed, procurement of contractors to carry out the works will be initiated. Subject to broad acceptance of the scheme proposals by the public and to successful completion of the tender process, it is hoped that construction will start towards the end of 2015, again subject to Confirmation of the Scheme by my Department. </p><p>  With regard to Bandon, detailed design of the flood relief scheme is now almost completed. The first stage of the procurement process for a civil works contractor was commenced in November 2013. However, following a legal challenge the OPW terminated the process. The OPW will recommence the pre-qualification process very shortly. </p><p>  The effect of having to re-run the process has meant that construction works are now expected to commence in the first quarter of 2015 rather than the previously anticipated start time of September 2014.  However, the delay in starting the works does not affect the completion date of the Scheme, which will still be programmed for completion towards the end of 2016. The reason for this is that the Scheme requires two summer seasons of channel works due to environmental constraints, and the scheme programme provides that works would take place in the summers of 2015 and 2016. The commencement of construction will of course, be dependent upon Confirmation of the Scheme.</p><p>  Construction of each of the schemes is likely to take 18 &ndash; 24 months to complete. The OPW has provided for the cost of the schemes in its multi-annual budget profiles for the period 2014-2017.</p></reply>

This Memorandum of Understanding outlines the principles of agreement between the OPW and Insurance Ireland on the information being provided and how it will be used by the insurance industry.  The OPW will provide Insurance Ireland with data on all completed OPW flood defence schemes which will show the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Insurance Ireland members will then take into account all information provided by the OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas, from 1 June 2014 onwards.  The provision of cover and level of premiums charged and policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers. </p><p>This is an important step forward for people in areas where flood defences have been provided by the OPW, as the OPW and Insurance Ireland are now working together to ensure that the flood defence works undertaken in recent years are being taken into account by the insurance industry.  There has been a substantial investment of &euro;320 million by the State in all parts of the country on flood relief works since 1995, with over 10,500 properties protected and benefits estimated at more than &euro;1 billion in damage and losses avoided.  While the Memorandum of Understanding does not provide any guarantee that insurance against flooding will be available in the relevant areas, I consider it important that the benefits of that investment in flood relief are felt by all members of those communities. </p><p>The OPW has to date provided information on 12 completed flood relief schemes in an agreed format to Insurance Ireland, and this information is now available to the insurance companies.  It has also been published on the OPW website .  The 12 Schemes on which information has been provided are:</p><p>Clonmel (River Suir) Dublin (River Dodder Tidal)</p><p>Dublin (River Tolka)</p><p>Dublin Fingal (River Tolka)</p><p>Duleek (River Nanny)</p><p>Dunmanway (River Bandon)</p><p>Ennis (River Fergus Upper) Fermoy (River Blackwater)Kilkenny City (River Nore)</p><p>Meath (River Tolka)</p><p>Mornington (River Mornington) </p><p>Tullamore (River Tullamore) </p><p>The OPW will continue to transfer data on flood relief schemes to Insurance Ireland as and when they are completed.</p></reply>

NERA aims to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.</p><p>Having regard to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts, it is not possible to provide information on specific cases.  It should be noted, however, that where there is reason to believe that that employees have been paid less than the minimum amount provided by law, NERA seeks to recover unpaid wages, as soon as possible, for all employees (both current and former) in respect of whom the underpayments have been identified.</p><p>The recovery of arrears is an important part of any case and is pursued by means of direct engagement with the employer and, where necessary, by the initiation of legal proceedings. In the majority of cases employers pay the arrears due without recourse to such action. Prosecution is, therefore, an important part of enforcement and can be used to deal with employers who refuse to comply with the law. Decisions about prosecuting an employer for breaching employment laws are based on a consistent proportionate and fair assessment of the seriousness of the alleged breach.  Mitigating factors such as the level of cooperation received, the previous history of breaches, whether an employer has rectified the breaches, whether employees have received redress in the form of unpaid wages or other entitlements, are all taken into account in arriving at a decision.</p><p>Neither NERA, nor its Inspectors has the power or authority to agree a compromise sum in respect of unpaid wages due to employees, or to negotiate away any part of an employee's legal entitlements.  Unlike cases prosecuted under the National Minimum Act (or those taken under the former Employment Regulation Orders), the legislation at that time governing Registered Employment Agreements did not give the District court, on conviction, the power to direct the employer to pay arrears in respect of breaches of an REA.</p><p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 introduced amendments to the enforcement provisions relating to breaches of REAs that were contained in the Industrial Relations Act 1946. In cases where an employer failed to comply with a Labour Court order, the 2012 Act provided for the Circuit Court to make an order directing the employer to comply with the original Labour Court order, including the obligation to pay any sum due to a worker for remuneration in accordance with an REA.</p><p>However, in the judgment delivered on 9 May 2013 in the<i>McGowan </i>case, the Supreme Court held that Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 was invalid having regard to Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution. The effect of this decision was to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. As a result, REAs no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are no longer enforceable in law.</p></reply>

That Article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that REAs were instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals. While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution. </p><p>The effect of this decision was to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law. </p><p>However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by REAs were unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.</p><p>The striking down of the REAs means that new employees in these sectors can be hired at a rate agreeable between workers and their employers. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.</p><p>My Department has been working closely with the Attorney General and external Counsel on developing a framework to address the ruling and to provide for a revised legislative framework, which will be fully informed by the Supreme Court judgment and constitutionally robust. </p><p>I intend to bring Heads of Bill to Government for approval in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The dispute has already been the subject of conciliation efforts in the Labour Relations Commission, where agreement was not reached, and a subsequent Labour Court recommendation. The Court found that the Company&rsquo;s current cost base is not sustainable and requires immediate remedial action in order to both protect employment and secure its customer base.</p><p>  In this context, the Court recommended that;</p><p>- The parties engage in a concentrated process to identify and cost the level of labour productivity savings that can be generated within the business and to agree on further adjustments to the wage bill necessary to return the Company to viability.</p><p>- The talks should be completed within 14 days of the date of its recommendation.</p><p>- The parties should engage the services of suitably qualified financial and productivity advisors to assist them through this process.</p><p>  The services of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery are available to assist the parties in the dispute.

It is also available to people who are less than 66 years of age, living alone and in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension, incapacity supplement or blind pension.</p><p>  The most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data from 2012 shows that the various poverty indicators demonstrate no significant difference in outcomes for those over 65 living alone, and those over 65 who live with another adult. The &ldquo;at risk of poverty rate&rdquo; for households aged over 65 with one adult was 12.9%. For households with two adults it was 13%. Similarly, the consistent poverty rate for households aged over 65 with one adult was 3.1% and for two adults it was 2.9%.</p><p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p><p>  The appropriate rate of welfare payments in 2015, including the weekly rate of the living alone allowance, will be considered later this year. In this regard, each &euro;1 increase in the living alone allowance would cost &euro;9.4milllion in a full year.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients, of which over 50,000 have been in payment for more than 18 months. Officials in the Department are working with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to progress the transfer of those customers with long-term housing needs from this Department to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP is designed to bring all long-term social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system to provide a more integrated and streamlined service for households and to give local authorities greater flexibility to provide assistance to those in need of social housing support. One of the key benefits that HAP will bring is the removal of barriers for people currently in receipt of rent supplement in returning to employment which is consistent with the Governments commitments under the Pathways to Work programme.  When fully rolled out, the HAP scheme will accommodate both long term customers currently on the rent supplement scheme and also new applicants who have been assessed by the local authority as having a housing need. Rent supplement will continue to be paid to clients who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support in order to pay their rent. These applicants would not normally require an assessment of housing need and the expectation would be that a return to employment would obviate the need for long term housing support.</p><p>  Rent supplement will therefore, over time, return to its original intention of being a short-term payment rather than providing for a longer term housing need. There are no plans to amend the existing payment arrangements under the rent supplement scheme, for what will effectively be required to address a short term need.</p><p>  I am satisfied that there is a requirement for the operation of both schemes, with HAP providing for customers long term housing needs and rent supplement to provide short term income support.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Fuel allowance is currently paid at &euro;20 per week during the winter season.  Some 410,000 customers receive the fuel allowance at an annual cost of &euro;208 million.  The allowance is subject to a means test and is paid only to those who live alone or with certain exempted people.</p><p>  The issue of paying the fuel allowance as a lump sum has been examined and it could create a number of difficulties for recipients. In particular, if the payment were given in advance as a lump sum, there could be significant over-payments if a recipient&rsquo;s circumstances were to change during the payment season.  If it were paid in arrears, it obviously would create further budgeting difficulties for individuals and their families.</p><p>  Many energy companies, including oil suppliers, provide budget facilities for making payment by monthly instalment over a period of time which allows people to plan and budget for fuel expenses.  I am satisfied that this arrangement is sufficient to meet the needs of customers.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for this group were to review the current range of youth employment services in Ireland, to assess what measures are appropriate to deliver the Youth Guarantee in Ireland and to develop the implementation plan for approval of Government and transmission to the EU.</p><p>  In addition, in order to get non-governmental input into the Youth Guarantee implementation plan the Department of Social Protection held a YG stakeholders&rsquo; consultation forum in October. The DSP invited further submissions from the bodies that attended.</p><p>  A number of submissions were received, including submissions from The National Youth Council of Ireland, Spunout.ie, Youthwork Ireland, Tipperary Regional Youth Service, Wexford Youth Action and the YMCA. These submissions will be taken into consideration during the rollout of the Youth Guarantee Process.</p><p>  In addition the Department retained the OECD to provide input and advice on the framing of the plan (the OECD is also providing assistance to a number of other countries). As part of this process a delegation from the OECD met with stakeholders at the aforementioned forum as well as with a range of relevant public bodies. Ultimately stakeholder feedback via the forum, submissions and bilateral meetings with the OECD has fed into the design of the national YG implementation plan.</p><p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation plan specifically states that the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) along with other national partners will be invited to participate in the delivery and/or review of the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>  The Ballymun Pilot Youth Guarantee scheme has strong involvement from the voluntary youth sector in its implementation.

The Ballymun Pilot is being mainly funded by the European Commission. Such specific funding for other pilot programmes is not available. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Department will operate a specific scheme for each of its 60+ local offices. However there will be flexibility to tailor the implementation to local conditions (for example with regard to the cohorts of young people to be selected for engagement in the first instance etc.) and the specific approach to be followed in each area, be it rural or local, will be a matter for local DSP management in consultation with relevant stakeholders. It is intended that the approach in other areas will however benefit from the lessons learned during the Ballymun pilot. In particular, it is intended, that local employment initiatives will be driven by local employer groups, local DSP/Intreo staff, local community groups and local training providers working collaboratively, as in Ballymun, to tailor the approach to their local circumstances.</p></reply>

Some 563 charities participated in the scheme in the past year and were able to avail of cheese, rice and butter.  The scheme has been discontinued from this year given the lack of intervention and surplus food stocks across the EU.  In March of the year, the European Council and Parliament agreed a regulation to introduce a new Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) to support the provision of food and consumer products for people who are most deprived.  The Fund will contribute to the reduction of poverty by supporting national schemes that provide non-financial assistance to alleviate food and severe material deprivation.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has been tasked with implementing this new EU co-funded programme.  When operational later this year, it is expected that this Fund, of which Ireland will receive approximately &euro;3 million per annum, will be able to support voluntary and other bodies working with and providing services to those most in need of support.  The regulation governing the operation of the Fund allow for food and non-food consumable goods to be distributed to persons who are most disadvantaged.  This programme will be broader in focus than that operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>  With respect to funding available to voluntary organisation providing food services, the Department can support such operations by way of labour input under its range of work placement and training programmes (such as community employment, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme).  No direct funding is provided.</p></reply>

The 2014 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers' schemes of &euro;3.28 billion.  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four in any period of seven consecutive days, so a person working any period of time five days a week will not qualify.  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  This is an important policy issue for the Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications for the jobseekers' schemes.</p><p>  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in 2011 to harness expert opinion and experience to address a number of specific issues around the interaction of the tax and social protection systems.

The Advisory Group is currently undertaking its final module of work on the issue of the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems to determine how the social welfare system can best achieve its goals of supporting persons through periods of involuntary unemployment while incentivising work and disincentivising welfare dependency.

Section 10 of the Pensions Act sets out the functions of the Pensions Authority.  Its core function is to monitor and supervise the operation of the Pensions Act.  Its remit is determined by the provisions of the Pensions Act and in this regard it is only qualified to determine matters which fall within that remit.  In this context, the Pensions Authority has the power to conduct an investigation of the state and conduct of a pension scheme where there are strong indications of a breach of the specific provisions of the Pensions Act.</p><p>  Any breach of the rules of a scheme whether it is a statutory or a non-statutory scheme can be referred to the Pension Ombudsman, where it is alleged that a scheme member has sustained financial loss occasioned by an act of mal-administration done by or on behalf of a person responsible for the management of a scheme or, where there is a dispute of fact or law done by or on behalf of a persons responsible for the management of the scheme.  Pension schemes are required to establish internal procedures for the resolution of disputes.  These procedures must be exhausted before a complaint can be referred to the Pensions Ombudsman for investigation.  As you may be aware, pension schemes in Ireland are generally established under trust and as such the trustees of a pension scheme are required, under trust law, to act in the best interest of all scheme members and beneficiaries who have recourse under trust law determine any alleged breaches of the trust.</p></reply>

Of the 1,379 total, 1,166 are Supervisors and 213 are Assistant Supervisors.  The salaries of CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors are paid by their local CE Sponsoring organisations, who are their legal employers.  Every four weeks during the CE project annual contract, the CE Sponsors can claim for the costs of supervision from the Department of Social Protection at the approved rates.  The Department provides a grant to cover the cost of employing Supervisors for a full-time 39-hour week, exclusive of lunch breaks.  This grant can only be used to fund supervisor wage costs for the 39-hour contractual week.  Any additional scheme work outside of the 39 hours contractual period will not be funded by the Department.</p><p>  With regards to pension arrangements for CE supervisors, the Labour Court recommended in July 2008 (LCR19293) that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S, the Agency responsible for CE at that time.  Notwithstanding the position of this Department (which now has responsibility for CE) in rejecting that liability for these costs be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE supervisors.  Given the level of funding that would be required from this Department, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and on-going fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum, with retrospective costs of the order of at least &euro;30 million.  It should also be noted that this Department is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.</p></reply>

In order to achieve its objective of targeting scarce resources at those who most need them, the Department undertakes a wide range of risk-targeted review projects annually.  Scheme review policies vary from scheme to scheme, and are dependent on the nature of the contingency the scheme fulfils.

As I indicated in that reply, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas.  In that context, I wish to acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's end of year statement for 2013 indicated that the rate of job losses in its client companies had reached a record low.  This was very welcome news indeed. However, while the level of job losses has stabilised, I am very cognisant of the ongoing difficult challenge in creating a sufficient number of new jobs to maintain, and indeed increase, employment levels in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>  I met recently with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and discussed its strategic proposal to increase its capital budget over time from the present level of &euro;5.687m to &euro;12m per annum.  I am very aware and supportive of the case advanced by the organisation that such an increase in funding would enable it to create an additional 300 jobs per annum. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, it was announced as part of Budget 2014 that comprehensive reviews of both current and capital expenditure would be undertaken by all Government Departments during 2014.  These reviews underpin the Government's multi-annual budgetary framework and are conducted periodically to re-set Departmental expenditure ceilings in line with emerging Government priorities.  The reviews are currently ongoing and will be considered by Government later this year with a view to underpinning expenditure ceilings for 2015 and beyond, as well as clarifying policy options and informing prioritisation decisions arising from the expenditure ceilings.  Clearly, the capital allocation for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for 2015 will be informed by the outcome of those reviews and within the framework of the Budgetary and Estimates processes later in the year.</p></reply>

In this context, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, is engaged in discussions with various stakeholders, including the EU institutions, in order to formulate specific proposals on the optimal approach to the derogation.

Salmon conservation limits are set similarly for all of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers.  The main criteria used are the size of the river (wetted area) and the latitude.  In addition factors specific to each river are used such as the proportion of one sea winter salmon and multi sea winter salmon in the population and the average weight of these salmon.  Other inputs to calculating conservation limits nationally are proportions of male and female salmon and the average numbers of eggs per female fish. </p><p>  The independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for Salmon revised the conservation limits for all rivers for the 2013 scientific advice.  The SSC advice for the Suir for 2013 was that the river was meeting its CL and had a surplus of 2,371 salmon.  On the basis of this advice a Snap net fishery was open, although with a restricted season to facilitate rational exploitation for the smaller surplus of Salmon in that river. </p><p>  The SSC advice for the Suir for 2014 was that the river was below its CL and had a deficit of 2,449 salmon.  The opening of a Snap net fishery on the River Suir can only be considered if there is a suitable surplus of salmon (in excess of conservation limit) available for harvest.  Any future decision on a fishery can only be taken in the context of the river being above its conservation limit. Ireland must be particularly careful to ensure that all national and international legislation and other obligations are met in any future management regime.</p></reply>

MANs are available to licenced telecoms providers to enable them offer high-speed broadband to their retail customers without having to build their own networks. </p><p>88 MANs, covering 94 towns, were constructed under the MANs Programme, at a cost of approximately &euro;176m.  The MANs were built in two phases &ndash; 28 MANs were constructed in Phase I between 2002 and 2004 and 60 MANs covering 66 towns were constructed during Phase II between 2006 and 2009.</p><p>A Value For Money and Policy Review of Phase I of the MANs Programme in 2007 concluded, inter alia, that the MANs model was not suited to all locations and recommended that towns of a significant size or those that had been earmarked for development under the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) should be prioritised for future investment under the MANs Programme.</p><p>In 2008, an evaluation was carried out on 81 towns with a population in excess of 1,500 persons (with reference to the 2006 census figures).  These towns included 28 towns that were originally planned for inclusion in Phase II, which was paused in December 2007, and the 29 towns planned for inclusion in Phase III of the Programme. Enniscorthy was one of the towns considered for Phase III of the Programme. Each location was evaluated following consultation with telecoms operators, Regional Authorities and the IDA and by reference to such criteria as:</p><p>- NSS status (hub or gateway town);</p><p>- Population;</p><p>- Customer demand;</p><p>- Regional Authority prioritisation;</p><p>- Interconnectivity to other networks. </p><p>The towns that were deemed to be strongest candidates for a MAN were then selected for a more detailed analysis, including a capital appraisal.  Enniscorthy was not among the towns selected for further analysis.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that Enniscorthy is already served by a number of commercial operators, providing broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms, including fixed, wireless and fibre technology.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Wexford, can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg's website at , as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p></reply>

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators. </p><p>The National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government's determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a long term, future proofed infrastructure build with next generation backhaul infrastructure (likely to be primarily fibre based) as the key component underpinning whatever access technology delivers the service (fixed or wireless).  This infrastructure build will extend to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 18 areas in County Kildare have been identified as requiring an intervention.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission's guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years.  In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 39 fibre-based broadband networks in County Kildare, by July 2016.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised.  This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p><p>In 2009, with the publication of the Technology Actions to Support the Smart Economy report, my Department identified the possibility of significant economic potential from first mover use of new types of flexible networking technology in a research context.  To this end it put in place the first phase of the Exemplar programme, a test bed facility based on one such new and advanced Irish technology - Optical Packet Switching and Transport (OPST) from Intune Networks.  My Department continues to engage with researchers on an ongoing basis on research projects employing the OPST technology. </p><p>The Exemplar test-bed is available to research institutions and commercial companies throughout Ireland who have been using it to develop and trial new technology and innovations, with one leading to the establishment of a new enterprise, FAZ Technologies.  The test-bed has also been used for several large EU funded research projects including FINESCE, ENVIROFI and ADDONAS.  The build-out of a network was always intended as a commercial development by private industry, rather than one funded by the State and while a new network has not evolved, researchers and industry continue to make valuable use of the test bed facilities.</p></reply>

The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. </p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The proposed annual PSO levy amount for 2014/2015 is &euro;327.7 million.  This equates to &euro;63.01 per annum for residential customers, &euro;215.94 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;33.38/kVA for medium and large customers.</p><p>  The biggest driver for the proposed levy rise for 2014-15 is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is currently estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover the allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by the lower international gas prices in evidence since spring 2014.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained for the coming months, it should help to reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay and, in turn, should enable those suppliers to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase.</p><p>  The increased costs to industry and households arising from the PSO levy are of concern to me and I have contacted the CER in this regard.  As the main reason for the increase in the levy is a decrease in wholesale electricity prices, I have asked the CER to be vigilant in its market monitoring and to focus particularly on the impact that the reduction in the wholesale price of electricity has on retail prices.  </p></reply>

Infrastructural developments have ensured that the network is well placed to accommodate gas demand in the medium term.  Currently, some 39% of Irish households are connected to the gas network and a further 18% of households are situated in areas which have access to the network.  It should be noted that Ireland has a low population density with a large proportion of households living in rural areas, in contrast to the situation in other, more densely populated, European countries. </p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the statutory, independent body, charged with the assessment and licensing of prospective operators seeking to develop and operate a gas distribution system within the State.  I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of new towns or customers to the gas network. </p><p>  In 2006 the CER approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite. </p><p>  This policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers. </p><p>  Prior to the roll out of gas to each town, a detailed analysis of the loads within the town and the revenues associated with them is carried out by Bord Gais Networks.  There is also a requirement to secure a certain level of customers prior to the development commencing. </p><p>  I am not aware of any publication by either the EU or the International Energy Agency (IEA) which provides information on the percentage of EU households that have access to natural gas networks.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-01a.632.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070100064#WRM01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos 288, 290 and 293 together</p><p>In June 2011, I established a Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which comprised the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications operators in Ireland and a number of smaller operators, together with senior officials from my own Department.  The purpose of the Taskforce was to consider how best to facilitate the delivery of high speed broadband by commercial operators, the appropriate role that Government could play in supporting commercial deployment, and to identify the gap in commercial deployment where the Government may have to intervene. </p><p>The report of the Taskforce was published in May 2012 and this critically informed the Government's National Broadband Plan which was published in August 2012.  Full details of the Taskforce membership and its deliberations are available on my Department's website. </p><p>Building on the work of the Taskforce, the National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Engagement with industry is central to the delivery of the objectives of the National Broadband Plan.  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a long term, future proofed infrastructure build with next generation backhaul infrastructure (likely to be primarily fibre based) as the key component underpinning whatever access technology delivers the service (fixed or wireless).  This infrastructure build will extend to locations in every county in the State as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services. </p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department, working closely with telecommunications service providers.  This exercise will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, .  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require a State intervention.  I would point out that the EU Commission's guidelines for the application of State aid rules precludes Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. </p><p>I have recently launched a stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention.  This consultation, among other things, seeks views on the proposed criteria to be used in finalising those locations which require a State intervention.  The outcome of this consultation will enable finalisation of the mapping exercise, which I expect will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention.  As part of this process consideration will be given to appropriate measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy once finalised. </p><p>Engagement with industry is therefore ongoing and is likely to intensify over the coming months.  Separately, my Department is continuing to meet with industry to address practical measures aimed at facilitating commercial deployment of broadband infrastructure services.  Issues such as road openings and planning have been progressed as part of this initiative.  It is planned to publish recommendations on open access fibre ducting and interior cabling for new residential buildings later this year, which should further facilitate deployment of services.  Industry is also working with the Department in the rollout of various initiatives under the National Digital Strategy.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

The Scheme has facilitated the availability of a basic, affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within 1,028 Electoral Divisions across 25 Counties.  In accordance with the EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the NBS intervention was for a limited duration and accordingly, the contract is due to expire on 25<sup>th</sup>August 2014. </p><p>&ldquo;3&rdquo; have confirmed to my Department that it will continue to provide coverage throughout the areas covered under the Scheme, on a commercial basis.  Furthermore, I understand that &ldquo;3&rdquo; plan to extend 4G coverage to these areas over the coming years.</p><p>Following expiry of the NBS contract and the cessation of the services specified under the contract, &ldquo;3&rdquo; will offer customers in NBS areas the same mobile broadband plans and tariffs, as those offered throughout its commercial footprint.  I understand that such plans include the option of a 15GB and a 60GB monthly data limit.</p><p>With reference to the provision of services to NBS satellite customers, which have been provided under the NBS contract via a third party supplier, I understand that commercially confidential negotiations are ongoing to ensure that these customers are offered a satellite broadband service on a commercial basis.  Until such time as these negotiations are finalised, I am not in a position to provide any further information. </p><p>I understand that each NBS mobile and satellite broadband customer will receive an individual letter from &ldquo;3&rdquo; in the next few weeks, informing them of the expiry of the NBS contract, the service options available to them as well as the opportunity to decline the services offered without penalty, should they so wish. </p><p>The NBS, combined with private investment, allowed Ireland to meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  The focus now is on ensuring that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas in terms of access to high speed connectivity.  In this regard, the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s broadband evolution is focused on the delivery of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, at .

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water, to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply.  The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households.  The Government has also decided that bills will be capped at the relevant assessed charge level for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage.  Qualifying medical conditions will be set out, following consultation with the Minister for Health and the Health Services Executive. </p><p>  In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package.  The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure will be developed by the Department of Social Protection.   </p></reply>

Under funding arrangements introduced in 2011, responsibility for the rigorous assessment, appraisal and decision making in relation to proposals for funding of particular homeless services within the current budgetary allocation rests with the homelessness statutory management group of the respective region. </p><p>  Future funding will be decided as part of the annual Estimates process.</p></reply>

The guidelines encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner.  It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by mean s of arrangement by installment.</p></reply>

Routes to registration already exist for individuals who are competent to design buildings and who have been doing so in an unregistered capacity for a significant number of years. I understand that each of the three registration bodies responsible for the registration of architects, building surveyors and chartered engineers has seen an increase in the level of applications for registration as a result of the new opportunities now available to registered construction professionals as a result of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014. </p><p>  A variety of routes to registration exist and Ireland is unique in providing mechanisms for those who can demonstrate that they have acquired the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to become registered. This would enable a person to sign statutory certificates of compliance as provided for under the new regulations. </p><p>  My Department has recently given preliminary consideration to the proposals put forward in recent weeks by the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists and by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland for separate voluntary registers of architectural technologists with a view to these registers being placed on a statutory footing at a future date. Both bodies have been invited to meet with my Department later this month in order to discuss how both sets of proposals for the registration and regulation of Architectural Technologists can be progressed.</p></reply>

The Environment Section of the relevant City or County Council is the appropriate contact point for reporting a noise nuisance in this regard. In addition, under section 108 of the EPA Act, where any noise is so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times as to give reasonable cause for annoyance, then it is open to any person, or group of persons, to bring a complaint to the District Court. The Court may order the person or body making, causing or responsible for the noise to take the measures necessary to reduce the noise to a specified level or to take specified measures for the prevention or limitation of the noise and the person or body concerned must comply with that order. </p><p>The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website at the following address: .</p><p>The Court may take into account whether the person alleged to have caused a noise nuisance took all reasonable care to prevent or limit the noise by using facilities, practices and methods of operation that are suitable for that purpose. </p><p>In the case of noise nuisance being caused by individuals in private rented accommodation, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 imposes minimum statutory obligations on landlords and tenants of private residential tenancies.  All privately-rented properties must be registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  One can check if a property is registered by contacting the PRTB; contact details can be found on the PRTB website: </p><p>Tenant obligations under the 2004 Act include an obligation not to engage, or allow visitors to engage, in anti-social behaviour which is defined as including persistent noise that interferes with the peaceful occupation of other dwellings in the neighbourhood.  The Act also imposes an obligation on landlords to enforce the tenant obligations. There is provision in the Act for third parties who are adversely affected by a failure on the part of a landlord to enforce tenant obligations to refer a complaint to the PRTB in accordance with the procedures in the Act.  However, if an alternative legal course of action is already being pursued, then the PRTB cannot intervene.   </p><p>In the case of noise nuisance being caused by local authority tenants, a person should contact the relevant local authority.  The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to the type of behaviour that is acceptable, and that which is not. A local authority is empowered, under Section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.</p></reply>

It has proven to be an effective tool for supporting the economic and social development of rural communities by providing resources for communities to support their own development. </p><p>  The continuation of the LEADER approach in rural areas is critical for the future development of rural Ireland. In this context it is the responsibility of my Department to ensure that all funding allocated under the LEADER elements of the RDP is compliant with the regulatory framework and is expended on the basis of sound financial management practices. My Department is currently working on developing the systems required to ensure that the funding is allocated and spent in the most effective way at a local level for the 2014-2020 period. </p><p>  To begin, there will be a two-step Local Action Group selection process that will ensure that all entities interested in delivering a LDS has the required capacity to do so. Once the strategy is in place, successful delivery entities will be required to put in place a series of systems outlined by my Department to support their effective and efficient delivery of the LEADER element of the RDP. These systems will include effective decision making practices to ensure that funding is targeted to maximise its impact. Transparent governance arrangements, sound financial management practices and comprehensive appeals mechanisms will also be required in order to support the efficient and effective delivery of LEADER interventions. These systems will be subject to on-going monitoring by my Department and other entities, including audit authorities, to ensure compliance. </p><p>  I believe that the comprehensive nature of the management systems that will be put in place to support the delivery of the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020 will ensure that the funding will be targeted, cost effective and efficient. </p></reply>

The final report on this research will be published by the EPA in the near future. The EPA has indicated that the Code of Practice will be subject to on-going review with regard to emerging on-site wastewater treatment system technologies.  The frequency and nature of such reviews are matters for the EPA. </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations. In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. This may include the prohibition or the restriction (e.g. a boil water notice) of the supply by the water supplier. The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions and boil water notices. Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website (<i>).</i></p><p>I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to issue a Water Charges Policy Direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted. Neither hard water nor the substances associated with hard water, such as lime, calcium and magnesium, require the restriction of a supply. </p><p>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.</p></reply>

The only exception to this is where construction or installation of a treatment system takes place after that date. In such cases, the owner of the premises connected to the treatment system is obliged to register within 90 days of the connection of the premises to the treatment system. </p><p>Registration facilities have been available since 26 June 2012 and have been comprehensively publicised. Owners of domestic wastewater systems who have not yet registered may still do so and there are no late payment fees payable (but the discount for early registration no longer applies). Registration can be completed via the website or in any local authority office.</p></reply>

No additional late payment fees will apply in subsequent years as the liability is frozen as of 1 September 2014.<table><tr><th>Liability Year </th><th>Liability if Payment made on or before 31 August 2014 </th><th>Additional Late Payment Fee post 31 August 2014 </th><th>Liability if Payment made on or after 1 September 2014 </th></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>&euro;1,260 </td><td>&euro;810 </td><td>&euro;2,070 </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>&euro;1,100 </td><td>&euro;730 </td><td>&euro;1,830 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;860 </td><td>&euro;610 </td><td>&euro;1,470 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;620 </td><td>&euro;490 </td><td>&euro;1,110 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;380 </td><td>&euro;370 </td><td>&euro;750 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;4,220 </td><td>&euro;3 , 010 </td><td>&euro;7,230 </td></tr></table>It is very much in the interest of non-compliant owners to come forward during the grace period to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off opportunity. The NPPR charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment. Local authorities will be taking a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner. I am advising all Non-compliant owners should log on to , or alternatively contact their local authority to arrange to regularise their NPPR affairs before 1 September 2014 to avoid incurring additional fees.</p></reply>

Investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy use in public infrastructure, including social housing, through the thematic objective of supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy, is among the eligible measures for ERDF co-funding under the Regional Operational Programmes 2014-2020.</p><p>  My Department has submitted a proposal costing &euro;100 million under the South and East Operational Programme 2014-2020 for the deep retrofitting of 2,000 older apartments and flats, of which 1,500 are in Dublin, 300 in Cork and 200 in Limerick. It is proposed that 50% of the cost would be met by way of loan finance from the European Investment Bank to a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHB&rsquo;s) who would undertake the retrofitting works and manage and maintain the properties on behalf of the local authorities. The balance of the funding would be met by way of a 25% capital contribution by the Exchequer and a 25% grant from the ERDF.</p><p>  It is intended that a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), representative of the participating local authorities and AHB&rsquo;s, the Housing Finance Agency and my own Department, will be established to manage the investment programme and oversee its implementation. However, the setting up of the SPV and the determination of appropriate governance and administrative arrangements, as well as consideration of further proposals of this nature, is contingent on the outcome of this proposal.</p><p>  My Department is working closely with the Office of Regeneration, Limerick City and County Council and the Irish Council for Social Housing with a view to progressing proposals for the active involvement of the Approved Housing Bodies in the retrofitting and construction of replacement housing in the Limerick regeneration areas.

A housing authority is also empowered to refuse to allocate, or to refuse to sell, a dwelling to such a person. At the policy level, every housing authority has a statutory duty to adopt and review an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 currently progressing through the Oireachtas includes a revised procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, enabling housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including because of engaging in anti-social behaviour. This will bring legislation in this regard into line with the European Convention on Human Rights Act, and in that context provide a fairer and more transparent procedure in respect of possessions providing appropriate safeguards for tenants, that were not there previously, where there is a dispute as to the facts of the case. The Bill also includes provisions that will strengthen the powers of housing authorities in relation to excluding orders and in this regard will extend the current prohibition to cover a specified place or area where there is at least one local authority house.</p><p>  I anticipate that the Bill will be enacted by the summer recess and believe that the provisions will allow for an improved mechanism that will serve the interests of both tenants and local authorities, while meeting the highest standards of the human and civil rights of all concerned.</p></reply>

The most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index and from the <i>Daft.ie</i>Rental Report show the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin and the major cities. In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.7% annually, and for apartments the figure was 10.3%. The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. In 2006, some 93,419 housing units were completed across the country, 19,470 of them in Dublin. In 2013, a total of 8,301 homes were completed nationally , with just 1,360 in Dublin. The volume of activity in residential building and construction remains less than half of the volume seen in the year 2000.</p><p>Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy, published on 14 May 2014, is a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector. It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce. Resolution of the housing supply situation is the key element in restoring stability to the market but I recognise that the provision of additional units of housing takes time. Consequently, I have asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations before the end of June. My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

Building Energy Rating (BER) assessment and certification is now well established as a mandatory requirement when a new dwelling is commissioned and when an existing dwelling is offered for sale or letting.

These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website: </p><p>It is not the intention of the Home Choice Loan scheme &ndash; or of any other Government intervention in the housing sector &ndash; to incentivise people into the market.  It is designed only to facilitate creditworthy households who have been affected by conditions in the mortgage market.  As such, the scheme is a temporary one which will be withdrawn once conditions in credit markets return to normal patterns.  Recent data published by the Central Bank would indicate that point has not yet been reached.   </p><p>To ensure effective targeting of limited resources, local authority loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only.  The option currently available for non-first time local authority homeowners wishing to relocate is to seek home loan facilities from one of the commercial lending institutions.   </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s recently published <i>Construction 2020 &ndash; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>aims to build a well-financed, competitive and innovative approach to construction and housing, building to the highest standards, at realistic levels and with consumer protection at its heart.  Construction 2020 contains 75 Actions in total and my Department, together with the Housing Agency, will be directly involved in the delivery of over 30 of these Actions.  The strategy seeks to address issues such as access to mortgage finance on reasonable and sustainable terms, explicitly recognising the need for greater mobility in the private housing market.  Action 4, which is being led by the Department of Finance, commits to examining the key barriers to housing mobility. </p></reply>

The new Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which I introduced last year, provides for increased levels of penalties.  This comprehensive Act sends a clear message to all that cruelty to animals is unacceptable and I believe that the increased penalties will act as a deterrent to perpetrators of such actions.  For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty has been raised from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000 with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment. </p><p>My Department continues to work very closely with welfare organisations, local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to ensure intervention in cases of animal neglect or cruelty.  In the past eighteen months, my Department has paid almost &euro;3.8m to the various local authorities throughout the country to assist their work in implementing their responsibilities under the Control of Horses Act, 1996.

The level of funding provided to these organisations has been increased for the third year in a row, reflecting the importance I attach to their work.  To enable the reporting of incidences of animal cruelty, my<b></b>Department continues to operate a network of regional offices throughout the country together with an Animal Welfare Helpline (lo call - 1850 211 990) and members of the public can report any instance where animal welfare may be compromised.</p></reply>

Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, Local Authorities have powers to designate exclusion areas by enacting by-laws prohibiting persons from having a horse in an area except for bona fide reasons and this could extend to horses used in sulky racing.  I would urge all local authorities to consider implementing these provisions in order to reduce the indiscriminate riding of horses by sulky racers. </p><p>  I have recently introduced new regulations concerning the identification and change of ownership of horses.  These regulations consolidate existing regulations and strengthen the powers of authorised officers to seize, detain and, where required, dispose of equines that are not compliant with the equine identification legislation.</p><p>  New regulations relating to the transfer of ownership of horses come into effect today, 1 July.  Under these regulations, ownership details of all new foals registered and horses bought and sold will be captured by Passport Issuing Bodies and on my Department&rsquo;s equine database, thereby readily identifying the owner/person responsible for the equine.</p><p>  As is evident from the foregoing, I have undertaken much work in the tightening of controls on the identification and traceability of horses in recent years.  My Department and other State Agencies now have a suite of instruments in relation to identification of horses, ownership and premises where horses are kept.  The new regulations will further assist my Department and other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities, in identifying and taking appropriate action on owners in cases where horses are found neglected or welfare-compromised.  </p></reply>

I understand, however, that there is an annual open season during which deer can legally be shot under licence.  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners who may apply to the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Permissions are issued by D/AHG where there is evidence of such damage.</p><p>  I am aware of the issues around an increasing deer population, including its effects on agriculture and forestry.  Deer management is complex, with different views held by various stakeholders and addressing deer related problems will require a high degree of agreement, co-operation and concerted action by the stakeholders and Departments concerned.  My Department, together with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, will shortly set up a non-statutory Irish Deer Management Forum, independently chaired with relevant officials from the two Departments as well as other stakeholders representing hunting, farming, forestry and conservation interests. </p><p>  My Department has received complaints about growing deer numbers in certain parts of the country and putative associations with higher levels of Bovine TB have been alleged.  However, my Department&rsquo;s belief is that, in so far as TB is concerned, the underlying problem in these areas is driven primarily by badgers and not by deer.  In fact, research has shown that deer as a species are not particularly effective as maintenance hosts for TB except when numbers are high.  In this context, an exercise conducted in 2007-2008 focused on TB strain-typing in cattle, deer and badgers, found a significantly higher prevalence in badgers than in either cattle or deer. </p><p>  With respect to TB in deer in Kerry, in the period since January 2011, samples from only 4 deer have been submitted through my Department&rsquo;s regional veterinary laboratories as suspect TB.  These samples were examined and cultured but TB was not confirmed in any deer (parasitic lesions and localised abscesses).  My Department therefore has no recent evidence to substantiate claims that the deer in Kerry are responsible for transmission of TB to cattle.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the complaints about high levels of TB in particular areas, there has been a very significant improvement in TB incidence in cattle over the past number of years: herd incidence has fallen from 5.9% in 2008 to 3.9% in 2013. The number of reactors has declined from 30,000 to 15,600 during the same period. While it is difficult to attribute the downward trends exclusively to a single factor, my Department believes that much of the improvement in the TB situation, in recent years, is attributable to the effective implementation of the badger removal programme. </p></reply>

The decision was taken to proceed with tissue tagging option on the basis that it is the most scientifically robust with the lowest error rate compared to the other two options as well as being the activity being most familiar to farmers.</p><p>My Department requested the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) to facilitate the implementation of the Scheme.  This reflects the ICBF&rsquo;s position as the only body approved in Ireland under EU legislation (Commission Decision 2006/427/EC) to carry out testing, genetic evaluation and publication of breeding values for Irish dairy and beef cattle.  The EU legislation states <i>&ldquo;all data must be recorded under the responsibility of the approved body&rdquo;</i>.  This legislation lays down performance monitoring methods and methods for accessing cattle&rsquo;s genetic value for purebred breeding animals of the bovine species to be operated in Member States.   </p><p>As my Department has an existing contract for the provision of tags, including conventional tags, electronic tags and tissue tags, the procurement of tissue tags for the purposes of implementation of the 2014 BGS is covered by this arrangement.  The contract for supply of these tags is effective from 1 November 2012 to 31 October 2014 but as the details of the contract are commercially sensitive I am not in a position to comment on it.  I am pleased to say however that the 2014 BGS is progressing very well with almost 100,000 samples returned from farmers to date. </p><p>The ICBF has a proven track record in this country in relation to large scale genetic evaluation projects, for example, the Economic Breeding Index (EBI) for dairy cattle.  This programme was developed between the ICBF and Teagasc and is the key profit driver for dairy farmers, and was designed to suit our unique spring calving production systems.  It is hoped that through the BGS and the development of an Economic Breeding Index (EBI) for beef cattle there will be a similar impact on profitability in the beef sector</p><p>The BGS in 2014 has an allocation of &euro;23 million and is funded by the Exchequer.  The purpose of the scheme is to build a training population for the genetic evaluation of the Irish beef herd. It is intended to follow on from this measure with a new programme called the &ldquo;Beef Data and Genomics Programme&rdquo; co-funded by the European Union (EU) under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020.  This scheme will support the application of genomic technology to the suckler herd and bring a new level of quality for all animals (bulls, cows, steers and heifers) into Irish beef herds. </p><p>All of these measures are continued evidence of the Government&rsquo;s financial support for the national suckler herd, which is a vital element of the Irish beef industry, and will allow the sector to achieve the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.</p></reply>

Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers.  Total live exports to date this year are over 154,000 head of which 26,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 2,400 head or 10% up on the comparable period in 2013.  Of this 26,000, some 19,100 went to Northern Ireland, which is an increase of 3% on the same period in 2013.</p><p>  However, the potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. This therefore decreases the attractiveness of animals born or reared in the Republic.</p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term. Nevertheless Bord Bia will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  In addition, Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity. </p><p>  I hosted two roundtable discussions with key stakeholders in the beef sector on 17 April and 3 June, at which these matters were discussed. Both I and Minister of State Tom Hayes T.D. have also had discussions with my Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on these issues and I will continue to engage with her on them, to the benefit of producers on both sides of the border.  In addition I expect that these issues will be discussed at the next agriculture sectoral meeting of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in September.</p></reply>

The main objective of the North-South strategy in the animal health and welfare area is to establish equivalent internal arrangements on both sides of the Border with a view to achieving freer movement of animals and animal products within the island.  There is ongoing co-operation through the dedicated working groups established under the North/South arrangements to further this objective.</p><p>  With regard to those diseases which are not harmonised at EU level, I believe that the Northern Ireland decision to establish a body with a similar remit to that of Animal Health Ireland should help to progress cross-border co-operation in this area.

Therefore, lands afforested during the period 2005 to 2008 were not and cannot now become eligible for payment under the Single Payment Scheme.  However, provision was made in the Regulations whereby farmers, who afforested part of their holding under the Afforestation Aid Scheme, could consolidate their entitlements on the reduced number of eligible hectares that they farmed.  That meant that farmers could benefit from full payment under both the Single Payment Scheme and Afforestation Aid Scheme. Many farmers in Ireland, who afforested part of their holdings, took advantage of these provisions.   </p><p>Following changes to the EU Regulations arising from the adoption of the CAP Health Check proposals, land which was afforested since 2009 is eligible to draw down a payment under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), provided that the afforested land meets the following requirements:</p><p>- The land to be afforested was declared on a 2008 SPS application form; </p><p>- The applicant who declared that land on a 2008 SPS application form was paid under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p>- The afforested was eligible for payment in 2008;</p><p>- The afforested land meets all the requirements of the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme.</p><p>Similar provisions covering the eligibility of afforested land are contained in Regulation (EU) 1307/2013 governing the requirements of the Basic Payment Scheme, which will replace the Single Payment Scheme from 2015 onwards.</p><p>It should be noted that the Afforestation Scheme is nationally funded.</p></reply>

Approximately 38% of these residents are children under the age of 18.  </p><p>Parents who live in direct provision centres have the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of their children who reside with them.  The safety of all residents &ndash; especially children &ndash; is at the forefront of RIA&rsquo;s objectives.  RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children.  RIA is, and will always be, compliant with all legislative requirements in this area.  RIA has a fully staffed child and family service unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system.  The unit also acts as a conduit between RIA and Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the latter having statutory functions in this area.</p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy is based on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' &ldquo;Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children&rdquo;.  This guidance document was developed to assist people in identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns.  The protection and welfare policy emphasises that the needs of children and families must be central to child care and child protection and welfare.  RIA's policy has been reviewed and updated and now contains a practice document to make it more user friendly. That draft document is now with Tusla for final feedback and it is anticipated that it will be published by the end of August, 2014 on RIA&rsquo;s website <i>.</i></p><p>In relation to the question of &quot;child protection teams&quot; it is important to understand that the existing and draft policy requires, inter alia, that each accommodation centre has a designated Child Protection Liaison Person who has undertaken Children First &ndash; Keeping Safe Training.  When a child protection or welfare incident arises in a RIA centre it is the function of that Liaison Person to contact the local Social Work Team to inform it of his or her concern and to liaise with the RIA Child and Family Services Unit.  RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy complements other policies and procedures in place, viz:</p><p>- Garda Vetting Policy.  All staff in centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.</p><p>- Complaints Policy.  Complaints by centre residents are dealt with in accordance with the procedures outlined in RIA's Accommodation Centre Services, Rules and Procedures (House Rules).  A copy of which is provided to all residents and sets out, inter alia, the obligations placed both on the centre manager and the resident.</p><p>- RIA Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding RIA residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment </p><p>- RIA Code of Practice for Persons Working in Accommodation Centres and RIA Staff  </p><p>- National Policy agreed between HSE and RIA in relation to reuniting children with adults  </p><p>- Policy on Accommodation of Aged Out Minors in RIA Accommodation Centres.</p></reply>

My Department does not provide direct funding to local groups, but funding is provided in relation to the employment and associated costs of a National Coordinator and Development Officers, as the long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to my Department to support effective community crime prevention actions.  I am currently providing the maximum possible funding to Community Alert that is open to me, having regard to the overall restrictions on my Department's resources and other expenditure needs.  I understand that funding for Community Alert is also received from the HSE. </p><p>  In relation to Neighbourhood Watch groups, while certain costs related to their operations are funded from the Garda Vote as approved by local Garda management, there is not a specific financial allocation for this purpose. </p><p>   I should also draw the Deputy's attention to the general supports which are available for community crime prevention groups.  In particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published new Community Crime Prevention Guidelines to facilitate the establishment of new local groups and also to help revitalise existing groups where necessary.  Further information, advice and support is available locally from community Garda&iacute;. The long-standing partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Muintir na Tire in supporting Community Alert was underlined by the signing of an updated Memorandum of Understanding between the two organisations in January last year.</p><p>  I can also advise the Deputy that local Garda management continue to engage with communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the relevant local policing arrangements, with a view to ensuring that the best possible policing service is provided.</p></reply>

The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentenced prisoners by the Parole Board. It is important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive a transfer to an Open Centre even if the recommendation is to that effect. The criteria considered for the transfer of prisoners from closed prisons to open centres include: the safety of the public (specifically flight risk in the case of open centres); compassionate and humane considerations (including facilitating family visits); nature and gravity of the offence; length of sentence served to date; length of sentence left to serve; prior record on temporary release; behaviour in prison; previous criminal history; family support; addiction issues/history; prisoner's home address.  Prisoners serving short sentences, i.e. under 12 months, can be moved to an open centre shortly after committal. Other longer term prisoners being prepared for the transition back into the community can be considered for moves with about 2 years left in their sentence. Exceptional prisoners who are engaging strongly with the therapeutic services can sometimes be considered for a transfer with up to 4 years left to serve in their sentence.</p><p>  All decision making staff and prison governors are aware of the need to take appropriate account of all the criteria to be applied to decision making in a balanced and considered manner.</p></reply>

All applications are processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and are submitted for to me decision as expeditiously as possible. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p><p>  Once the certification fee and requested documentation has been received the applicant is scheduled for the next available ceremony.  Invitations are generally issued four weeks prior to each ceremony day, which are currently being held every 2-3 months.   As of 27 June 2014,  4,200 candidates had paid the certification fee for naturalisation of whom 4,000 were invited to attend the upcoming citizenship ceremonies on the 4th July. Certification fees and documents continue to be received on a daily basis and scheduling has commenced for the next ceremony day.</p><p>  I am advised that there are approximately 8,400 applications on hand currently pending decision.  As outlined above, with ceremonies for around 4,000 scheduled every 2/3 months, the overall targets set for processing of cases has been met.</p><p>  Where the allocated ceremony date does not suit the candidate, they may inform the ceremonies unit of this and they will be invited to the next available citizenship ceremony.</p></reply>

The first is where the details are provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to submission of an application for a summons in respect of the offence.  Where the driving licence number is so collected, the driving licence number is sent electronically to the Courts Service with the summons application and the licence number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.  Under the second method, the details are collected by the Court Registrar where a licence is produced to the Court at the hearing of the offence.</p><p>  As outlined above, if the licence is produced, the Court Registrar records the licence number and the number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.  If the accused is convicted of the offence, the details of the conviction and the associated driving licence number are subsequently sent electronically to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the application of penalty points.</p><p>  The Courts Service has indicated that it is not possible to differentiate between the two methods above to provide statistical data in relation to the number of driving licence numbers actually collected within a Court.</p><p>  I am informed that where an accused is summonsed to appear before a court in respect of a penalty point offence and is convicted of the offence, if a driving licence is not produced to the Court, the Court Registrar records on the Court Minute Book or on the summons that no driving licence was produced.  The non-production of the driving licence is recorded whether or not the accused appears before the Court.  The Courts Service computer system does not currently support the updating of data in relation to the non-production of driving licences in Court.  Last week, along with the Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport, I met with PARC an advocacy group for road safety. At the meeting I agreed to raise the issue of the presentation of licences with the Courts Service.</p></reply>

Under these statutory complaints structures the Law Society is, therefore, the main route of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors, outside of the courts. The Society&rsquo;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints in relation to misconduct, inadequate services or excessive fees made directly to it by members of the public. The Society provides guidance on &ldquo;making a complaint&rdquo; on its website, www.lawsociety.ie.</p><p>The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or made directly by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. In more serious cases, where the Tribunal considers that a solicitor should be suspended or struck off it will make such a recommendation to the President of the High Court. Further details are available on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website www.distrib.ie.</p><p>Members of the public who are dissatisfied with the way the Law Society has dealt with a complaint may also refer it to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (www.independentadjudicator.ie). The Office of the Independent Adjudicator was established to provide an independent point of contact to which members of the public could have recourse if dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society had dealt with a complaint. It is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the original complaint.</p><p>In addition to the  remedies available under the statutory complaints handling framework that I have just outlined, aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts. This typically arises in cases of negligence on the part of a solicitor which have had serious negative consequences for the client concerned. As with any court proceedings, it is considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case and its possible cost implications. It will then be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to the circumstances of their particular complaint. It is also understood that the Law Society maintains a list of solicitors who are prepared to act in such negligence proceedings against another solicitor and this list can be obtained upon request.</p><p>It should also be noted that in order to be permitted to practice by the Law Society, individual solicitors are obliged to have Professional Indemnity Insurance to cover such instances of negligence as those raised by the Deputy. The current minimum level of such insurance is set under legislation at &euro;1.5 million and the professional indemnity insurance details of an open solicitor firm can be found under the on-line firm search facility on the Law Society's website at: .</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which is due to commence Report Stage in the D&aacute;il on 17 July, will establish a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. There will be a new complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council backed up by a Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal.

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p><p>An interdepartmental committee on the Convention is reviewing the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  As part of its work programme, the committee has identified issues to be considered by various Departments and examination of these issues is ongoing.  At the request of the committee, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, has also assisted in assessing remaining requirements for ratification to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>For my Department, one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity. The Bill will go to Committee Stage shortly. The enactment of this legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN Convention.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The primary consideration in any vetting process is to ensuring the safety of children and vulnerable adults and as such vetting processes demand rigorous procedures to ensure their integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service. To that end full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.  </p><p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction. Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.</p><p>  There are, however,  certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.   </p><p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks. </p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that, in general, the target time for processing asylum applications is 9 to 10 weeks. </p><p>The Refugee Applications Commissioner is statutory independent in the exercise of his functions. The Commissioner has advised that it is the policy of the office to ensure that applications for refugee status are processed as speedily as possible in the context of the available staffing resources and other priorities within the Office.  Accordingly, the number of staff available for processing can vary  and is augmented from time to time by staff from other  units as resource redeployment permits. There is also a network of support staff who carry out a variety of application processing related functions  such as  taking applications for asylum, scheduling interviews, arranging interpretation  and translation, issuing recommendations, dealing with Judicial Reviews, processing of Dublin Regulation cases and so forth<b>.  </b>These staff also perform similar  functions for other areas of the work in ORAC, including Subsidiary Protection, and accordingly, it is not possible to separate out the time spent on asylum cases exclusively.  The overall resources of the office are kept under review taking into account the demand led nature of the work of the Office.  </p><p>The median processing time for asylum applications in 2014 (to end April) is 12.1 weeks. Various strategies are being advanced to manage processing times in ORAC including the scheduling of some Saturday interviews.</p><p>The median processing time to a final decision by the Minister on an asylum application in 2013 to include the appeals process in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) was 36 weeks. Some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and other relevant statutory provisions.  High quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process. </p><p>Persons who are refused refugee status are notified of their entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process. This is invariably followed by the so-called leave to remain process. Each of these processes which determine whether an applicant can remain in the State are hugely complex and subject to oversight by the courts and have to be examined in accordance with a large body of Irish and international law. There are no shortcuts as the outcomes can lead to the most fundamental life-changing event for the applicants.  </p><p>Measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of protection applications. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the ORAC with appeals to be dealt with by the RAT.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, <i>inter alia</i>, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality, to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising, in the shortest possible timeframe  consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising. </p><p>The Government remains committed to legislative reform in this area as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with. In this regard, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection is a key priority for this Government. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

Its function is to provide accommodation and related services to those who have sought international protection and who have no means of supporting themselves otherwise. More than 53,000 such persons have availed of RIA's services to date. </p><p>As at 8 June 2014, there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres across 16 counties.  The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly since the end of December 2008, since when the number of persons being accommodated by RIA had declined by 38%. </p><p>Details as to the length of time spent by residents in the direct provision system as at the end of December, 2013 are shown on the 2013 RIA Annual Report published on its website -<i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.  This shows that by the end of 2013, 68.2 % of RIA residents had first claimed international protection in Ireland three or more years previously.</p><p>In essence, RIA accommodates all those who make a claim for international protection and who seek accommodation until such time as they leave voluntarily; are removed - either by way of deportation or Dublin II transfer; are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection; or are granted leave to remain, either through the process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999 or are granted permission to remain in the State on some other basis.  There is therefore no immediate year on year connection between the numbers residing in direct provision accommodation centres and the number of asylum applications processed. Nonetheless, details of the yearly processing of asylum claims by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner are available on its Annual Reports published on its website - <i>www.orac.ie.</i></p><p>The median processing time to a final decision on an asylum application in 2013 was 36 weeks.

There are no shortcuts as the outcomes can lead to the most fundamental life-changing event for the applicants.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware my predecessor<b></b>made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State. The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case.</p><p>Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. My aim is for applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.</p><p>More generally, I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.</p><p>As at 8 June 2014, there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres across 16 counties. The expenditure outturn for the accommodation costs incurred by RIA in the last five years is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Outturn</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;55.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;62.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;69.5m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;79m</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;86.5m</td></tr></table>The 2014 Estimate Provision for RIA is &euro;51.9 million.  More detailed information on the breakdown of costs associated with the Direct Provision system can be found in RIA Annual Reports on its website - www.ria.gov.ie.  For example, the 2013 RIA Annual Report shows that RIA paid &euro;45.735m to private contractors in respect of commercially owned centres and &euro;6.901m to private contractors in respect of the management of State-owned centres.</p><p>Of the 34 centres currently under contract to RIA, 7 are State owned i.e. the land and buildings are owned by the State.  Whilst all centres are managed by private companies under contract to RIA, the rates paid by RIA takes into account the differing costs undertaken directly by these companies, depending on whether it is a State owned or privately owned centre.  A key element of these contracts is the rates paid by RIA on a per person per day (PPPD) basis.  This rate does not distinguish between adults and children.</p><p>As has been stated in answers to previous D&aacute;&iacute;l Questions, details of <i>current</i>contract rates are not provided. The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, e.g. at the end of January, 2013 the records are updated to end of December 2010.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.   </p><p>Nonetheless, it is possible to give a general indication of the rates currently paid. As mentioned above, these rates are on a per person per day (PPPD) basis. Currently, the average PPPD rate for direct provision centres is &euro;29.49 while the same contract rate for State-owned centres averages at &euro;15.50.  </p><p>The two PPPD rates cited above are not directly comparable.  The direct provision rate is a single all-inclusive figure  which includes, <i>inter alia,</i>energy, maintenance, transport and VAT costs. By contrast, the State-owned rate does not include any of these costs, which are borne directly by the State and not by the contracted management company. </p><p>It should be noted that the direct provision system is only one element of the State&rsquo;s response to its international obligations on the asylum issue. The system is based on the principle of mainstream service provision so that residents receive the same health and community welfare supports as the general population. As regards education, children of asylum seekers are linked to local mainstream primary and post-primary schools as well as ECCE pre-school placements in a like manner to the general population.  As well as these educational, health and welfare costs, there is the asylum determination system itself, as well as the downstream judicial and policing costs.  All countries which take their responsibilities in this area seriously are faced with similar calls on their financial resources.  For example, it was estimated that in the period 2005 to 2009 inclusive, the total amount spent across the whole of Government on asylum seekers was &euro;1,275.31 million, of which &euro;424.43 million was spent on the direct provision system.  </p></reply>

Persons with official refugee status in the state may also meet the nationality clause of the schemes. Persons in the asylum process are not entitled to free fees. However, time spent from date of official lodgement of application papers for refugee status will be included for the purpose of meeting the three year residency requirement.</p><p>Persons in the asylum process who are declared a refugee during the course of their studies may be entitled to free tuition fees for the remainder of their course of study as follows:</p><p>- Students who acquire refugee status up to 31 January in an academic year may be entitled to free tuition from the second half of the academic year.</p><p>- Students who acquire refugee status from 1 February may be entitled to free tuition fees from the commencement of the next academic year.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has advised that there are no plans at present to extend the scope of the Student Grant Scheme or the Free Fee Schemes to provide for young persons in the asylum process and in direct provision centres.  <b></b></p></reply>

Its function is to provide accommodation and related services to those who have sought international protection and who have no means of supporting themselves otherwise. As at 8 June 2014, there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres across 16 counties.</p><p>  Asylum seekers are entitled to the same public health services, including mental health services, as Irish citizens. In addition, asylum seekers in direct provision centres qualify for a medical card which allows them access a range of health services free of charge.</p><p>  Asylum seekers in direct provision first link in with health services when they are temporarily accommodated in a reception centre in Dublin after they first claim international protection.  In the reception centre, they are offered medical screening and are linked in with Community Welfare services.  Access is also provided to GP's, Public Health Nurses and psychological services. After a period of approximately two weeks, those asylum seekers are scheduled for dispersal to accommodation centres throughout the country, subject to clearance by the HSE Health Centre in the reception centre. If there are particular health concerns, a person may be retained for a period at the reception centre or may be dispersed to specified accommodation centres with access to particular health services.  Even after dispersal, further health needs may present.  Such cases are reviewed by RIA's internal administrative health unit in conjunction with the local health services to see if any administrative arrangements, transfers etc., can be put in place. RIA has access to an independent medical referee to assist in the assessment of particular health needs.</p><p>  As I have stated elsewhere, I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with so that protection seekers spend as little time as necessary in direct provision.  </p><p>  A key priority for this Government is legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

The remainder are for the most part processed within one week with a small amount of more complex cases taking up to 15 days. This time frame is of course dependent on all the required documentation being provided with no queries remaining outstanding. </p><p>As a result of a number of initiatives which my Department has introduced, the number of short stay visas (including visas for tourism purposes) granted to Chinese nationals has grown steadily from just over 7,300 in 2011 to over 8,100 in 2013, an 11% increase. The approval rate for visa applications from China is 92% which compares very favourably internationally. The grant rate for Chinese nationals overall i.e. including applications made outside China is even higher at 95%.  </p><p>These initiatives offer Chinese nationals who wish to travel to Ireland as tourists with a number of options. For example, the Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme, introduced with effect from 1 July 2011, has proved to be very successful in facilitating Chinese nationals who wish to visit Ireland. The Programme applies to holders of UK short stay visas from eighteen selected countries, including China, and allows visitors, who are in possession of a UK visa, to travel on to Ireland without the need to apply for a separate Irish visa. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in their latest report on the impact of the Programme estimate that there has been an additional 12,700 visits to Ireland by Chinese nationals, between July 2011 and October 2013, as a direct result of the Programme i.e. in addition to the growth in those visiting the State using Irish visas.  </p><p>Chinese nationals can also apply for a visa as part of an Approved Destination Scheme (ADS) Group Tour, for an individual tourist visa or for a visit visa which is normally used for visiting family members. Several measures have been introduced in the last number of years to encourage this type of tourist to Ireland resulting in an ADS visa being now one of the most straightforward and quickest Irish visas to obtain with processing times being less than five working days normally. In recognition of the growing number of affluent and independent tourists from China, a scheme to enable independent Chinese travellers to come to Ireland was introduced in November 2011. This category of visa application is processed within 10 working days. All processing times are, of course, dependent on the required supporting documentation being provided by the applicant. To help with this, application guidelines for all visa categories are published on the Irish Embassy website in English and Chinese. </p><p>The Government has also taken other steps to make the visa process easier, including, with effect from 1 August, 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for Chinese business travellers and regular family visitors.  This regime compares favourably with the approach taken by our nearest competitors.  For example, it allows for a multi-entry visa for 3 years for &euro;100 for qualifying travellers which compares with the $180 charged by the USA for the same duration.  In addition, agreed programmes aimed at short stays for the purpose of learning English in Irish colleges, with accelerated processing of applications and reduced formalities, have been introduced.</p><p>Whilst I am satisfied that Ireland compares favourably with international competitors regarding processing times and approval rates for visas from China, I continue to seek, with my officials in INIS, ways in which the visa regime may be enhanced in order to encourage and facilitate tourism to Ireland, especially from emerging markets such as China.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement of the launch of a joint visa initiative between the UK and Ireland, the &quot;British Irish Visa Scheme&quot; which will, from the autumn of this year, allow tourist and business visitors from China to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK on the basis of a single visa. </p><p>This initiative represents a major evolution of the Common Travel Area arrangement and an historic breakthrough in developing the CTA to its natural conclusion where visas issued by either country will be mutually recognised.   While making travel to the CTA easier for Chinese citizens, the scheme will bring benefits for the entire island of Ireland as, for the first time, visa required visitors to Ireland and the UK will be able to move freely between North and South using a single visa.  By removing the need for Chinese visitors travelling to the UK and Ireland to obtain separate visas the number of visitors from there to the island of Ireland is expected to increase very significantly. </p><p>In relation to the arrangements for visa applications by holders of public affairs, or &quot;official&quot;, passports, all such applications are processed by the Beijing Visa Office through a special arrangement with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  The Beijing office has an excellent working relationship with the Ministry and applications received from there are prioritised and expedited.  In addition, the normal requirements for supporting documentation are significantly reduced.  As an example, in preparation for a recent high level visit to Ireland from China, 83 applications were processed within 24 hours.  </p><p>No complaint of the type referred to by the Deputy has been made against officials of my Department - either based here or in China.  Officials assigned to consular offices abroad are selected from the staff of my Department following a competitive interview process and do not only handle visa processing but are also involved with important promotional activities for Irish tourism and business in China.  A number of visiting Government Ministers have specifically praised their role in such activities. The staff also develop and implement necessary risk profiling and document verification skills locally.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-01a.1028.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070100071#WRT01800"><p>The latest available figures indicate that at the end of January 2014 there were just over 1,270 persons in the direct provision system with subsidiary protection decisions pending and 400 persons with leave to remain decisions pending.   </p><p>  These statistics do not tell the full story because of the complex nature of our protection system. For example, in relation to families, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department processes the entire family unit together. However, a number of different members of the family can be at different stages of the process. This can arise for a number of different reasons - one family member appeals to their case to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) while another does not. Also, in many cases, a Judicial Review can be instigated by one family member (often a child) to an asylum decision while the remainder of the family will either be at Subsidiary Protection or Leave to Remain stage. However, INIS will await the outcome of the Judicial Review process as it endeavours at all times to keep the family unit together for processing. The Deputy will appreciate the desirability of having the cases of all family members brought to finality, be the outcome favourable or unfavourable, at the same time.</p><p>  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to have all outstanding cases brought to finality as soon as it is possible to do so. I should add that this position applies equally to persons residing in Direct Provision accommodation as well as those residing elsewhere. </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of subsidiary protection applications.  The European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) with appeals to be dealt with by the RAT.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality, to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising, in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising. To date significant progress has been made with this caseload. Over 1500 applicants for subsidiary protection have indicated their wish to proceed and the process of interviewing applicants began in December 2013. By the end of June, around 700 applicants had been scheduled for interview. The ORAC has also begun the process of issuing determinations.</p><p>  In the context of cases currently at the leave to remain stage of the process, particular attention is paid to those cases which are awaiting a decision for the longest periods as well as the cases of persons with a history of criminality.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to legislative reform in this area as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with. In this regard, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection is a key priority for this Government. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.   The situation has not changed since 2011 and, as has been indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on the subject of upward only rent review clauses, there are no plans to re-examine the decision which was taken in 2011, nor are any plans to have a referendum on this matter.<b><font color="#000080">   </font></b></p></reply>

With the cooperation of the Oireachtas I expect the Bill will have a reasonably speedy progress towards enactment.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that priority is being given to the processing of applications and making lump sum payments.  The recommendation regarding maintaining a permanent dedicated unit is a longer term issue and will be addressed after processing of applications has been completed.</p></reply>

However, in an emergency admission if a private designated bed was not available and a private in-patient was accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge was not levied, although the private in-patient continued to pay the fees of his/her hospital consultant.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimated in his 2010 Annual Report that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance in public hospitals because they were not occupying designated private beds. That situation represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients. In effect, private patients were not meeting the costs of the hospital services they used.  It was, and is, my belief that situation could not continue and that the new charges makes sense. </p><p>  While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, an essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient. </p><p>  The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital and on that basis introduced legislation in 2013 to amend Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 which provides for the charging of private in-patients. Since 1 January 2014, private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to charges that range from &euro;329 to &euro;1,000 per day. It is not intended to reverse this policy.</p></reply>

The proposed draft Regulations constitute a major amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations.  Over 90 submissions were received from a wide range of organisations and individuals. While my Department has no plans to publish these, they are available if requested.  Work is ongoing on the drafting of these regulations. This process is taking longer than anticipated because it is a complex and technical body of work.   The regulations will be finalised as soon as possible.  </p><p>  The purpose of the Technical Standards Directive is to eliminate or reduce the barriers to the free movement of goods which can arise from the adoption of different national technical regulations.    Under the Directive any regulations providing for such restrictions are required to be notified to the European Commission.  Accordingly, in view of the additional controls it is proposed to introduce in relation to certain substances, the Department is required to notify these under this Directive.  </p></reply>

There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered under the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. </p></reply>

Information relating to the proposed Mount Carmel sale or any potential property sale, if it was available to me, would be commercially sensitive and could not be divulged.  Commercially sensitive information would include bid details and information used to determine the bid.  </p><p>  Also, I wish to repeat briefly what I said on 18 February last at the Joint Committee on Health where the closure of Mount Carmel Maternity Hospital was discussed - that there may be other potential uses for the buildings.  As you will be aware, I stated then that I have a responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure that public money is used prudently and  I remain firmly of the view that the purchase of Mount Carmel as a going concern, or as a going concern for other purposes, cannot be justified.   To do so would unnecessarily expose the HSE and the State to all contingent liabilities and to very obvious significant financial risks.    </p><p>  As Mount Carmel Maternity Hospital was a private not a public hospital being sold on behalf of NAMA I am not in a position to offer a view on the financial return to the State from the sale, and I have no information on the sale of equipment. </p></reply>

The commitment to develop a maternity strategy arises from my acceptance on 9 October last of the recommendations of the HIQA Report into the death of Savita Halappanavar.  That report recommended that a strategy be developed to implement standard, consistent models for the delivery of a national maternity service that reflects best available evidence, to ensure that all pregnant women have appropriate and informed choices, and access to the right level of care and support. </p><p>  I have not as yet established a Group to oversee the development of the strategy but work on the strategy is ongoing in my Department and the HSE.  A desk based review of national and international literature on best practice in the organisation and delivery of maternity services is underway, as is a review and evaluation of services currently provided.  This review will give us the opportunity to take stock of the services that are provided to women and their babies in our 19 maternity hospitals, and identify how we can further improve the quality and safety of the care we provide. </p><p>  I can confirm that the Strategy has been discussed at meetings between my Department and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; indeed I met with the Institute some time ago and the Strategy was one of the items discussed.  I can also confirm that a consultation process will be undertaken at an appropriate time, with a view to finalising the Strategy by the end of this year.</p></reply>

Contrary to the Deputy's assertion, the cumulative effect of Ireland's tobacco control legislation to date has been a decrease in the number of people smoking.  In 2013, the National Tobacco Control Office reported that 21.5% of Irish adults smoked (22.9% men and 20.2% women).  This represents a decline of 2.2% since 2010, and a decline of 7.5% since 2007 when the last comprehensive large scale study on smoking prevalence in Ireland was undertaken (SLAN study).  </p><p>Two of the initiatives specifically mentioned by the Deputy, the ban on packets containing less than 20 cigarettes and the ban on the display and advertising of tobacco products, were specifically aimed at young people and the research bears out their success.  Data on smoking among school-aged children indicates a clear downward trend.  The Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey (2010) found that 27% of children reported that they had ever smoked tobacco - a 9% decrease from the 2006 Survey.  There was a reduction of 9.2% in the number of children who said they were current smokers; 80% of 15 to 17 year olds said they <i>do not</i>smoke and nearly 90% of 12 to 17 year olds <i>do not</i>smoke.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that ten years after the ban on smoking in the workplace, there is now concrete evidence of its effectiveness.  Research has found that the ban resulted in 3,726 fewer smoking related deaths than would have been expected if the ban had not been brought in.  The smoking ban was also associated with a number of immediate reductions in ill-health in the general population</p><p>- an immediate 13% decrease in all-cause mortality</p><p>- a 26% reduction in ischaemic heart disease</p><p>- a 32% reduction in stroke, and</p><p>- a 38% reduction in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).</p><p>It is important to state that the introduction of standardised packaging is just one of a suite of measures that are being and will be implemented in Ireland to reduce the number of people smoking and as such this initiative should not be looked at in isolation.  <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, the latest policy document in the area, sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free by 2025.  In practice, this will mean a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%.  <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>addresses a range of tobacco control issues and initiatives and contains over 60 recommendations, including the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products.  I am confident that the measures outlined in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>will further reduce the numbers of people, young and old, smoking in Ireland.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the tobacco industry has argued that standardised or plain packs would be easier to forge and would lead to growth in illicit trade of tobacco products.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are satisfied that the standardised packaging legislation will not have a significant impact on their work in relation to illicit trade in tobacco products.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that the tax stamp is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged.  Tax stamps will remain a fixture on tobacco products following the introduction of standardised packaging, and contain all features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting. </p><p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners.  They have extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and in addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.  Research carried out by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with the HSE National Tobacco Control Office, indicates that contraband represents the majority of illicit cigarettes and not counterfeit products.  Figures from 2013 indicate that the proportion of smokers classified as having an illegal pack was 12%, representing a decrease of 4% since 2009.  These findings indicate that the level of consumption of illicit product is being contained, although Revenue remains determined to confront the illegal trade in tobacco products, to optimise levels of seizures of illicit tobacco product and to pursue those found to be involved in this illegal activity.  </p><p>  In addition to this the 2014 EU Tobacco Products Directive sets out provisions to be adopted by Member States in relation to traceability and security features of tobacco products.  Tobacco products will be marked with a unique identifier and security features.  This will allow for their movements to be recorded and for such products to be tracked and traced throughout the EU.  This will also facilitate the verification of whether or not tobacco products are authentic.</p><p>  Following Government approval, Ireland's Permanent Representative to the United Nations signed the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, adopted by the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), in New York on 20th December 2013.  The new international treaty is aimed at combating illegal trade in tobacco products through control of the supply chain and international cooperation.  As a key measure, Parties commit to establishing a global tracking and tracing system to reduce and eventually eradicate illicit trade.</p><p>  In view of the above it is anticipated that illicit trade of tobacco will not increase as a result of the introduction of standardised packaging.</p></reply>

In preparing the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014, my Department commissioned an international expert in the field, Prof. David Hammond, to carry out an <i>Evidence Review on Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products</i>.  Prof Hammond's review found that the evidence on standardised packaging has rapidly evolved and is now notable for its breadth and diversity.  Research has been conducted in 10 different countries, using a range of methodologies, including consumer perceptions, eye-tracking technology, neuroimaging, measures of consumer demand and behavioural tasks. </p><p>Prof Hammond's review unequivocally found that tobacco packaging is a critically important form of tobacco promotion, particularly in countries like Ireland which have comprehensive advertising and marketing restrictions.  The evidence showed that standardised packaging:</p><p>- reduces false beliefs about the risks of smoking, </p><p>- increases the efficacy of health warnings, </p><p>- reduces consumer appeal among youth and young adults, and </p><p>- may promote smoking cessation among established smokers.</p><p>Overall, Prof Hammond found that there is very strong evidence that standardised packaging would be effective with regard to four of Ireland's tobacco control policy objectives, namely:</p><p>- preventing children and young people from starting to smoke, </p><p>- encouraging current smokers to quit, </p><p>- reducing the risk of those who have quit from relapsing, and </p><p>- encouraging the denormalisation of smoking in society, thereby protecting children from the marketing practices of the tobacco industry. </p><p>Two systematic reviews of the research evidence covering 54 studies were published by Moodie <i>et al</i>in 2012 and in 2013.  These reviews, and other studies, suggest that standardised packaging can:</p><p>- Reduce the appeal of tobacco products, for both adults and children.</p><p>- Increase the noticeability, recall and impact of health warning messages; and</p><p>- Reduce the ability of packaging to mislead consumers into believe that some products are less harmful than others.</p><p>Moodie's review concluded that the evidence shows that standardised packaging: &ldquo;has the potential to contribute to reductions in the harm caused by tobacco smoking now and in the future&rdquo;.  In the UK, Sir Cyril Chantler's independent review on <i>Standardised packaging of tobacco</i>also indicated overwhelming support for the measure.  In reviewing the evidence, Sir Chantler made a connection between exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion and the likelihood of taking up smoking, particularly among children.  He concluded that branded packaging contributes to increased tobacco consumption.  In his judgment, the evidence shows that standardised packaging is very likely to have a positive impact on public health by causing &ldquo;a modest but important reduction over time on the uptake and prevalence of smoking&rdquo;. </p><p>A year on from the introduction of plain packaging in Australia, we have a limited amount of research on the effects of the policy.  One study found that following the introduction of plain packaging and larger pictorial warnings on packs, smoking in outdoor areas declined by 23%.  It also found that personal pack display (where packs are clearly visible on tables) declined by 15%, particularly in venues where children were present.  Another Australian study found a 78% increase in the number of calls to the smoking cessation helpline.  This increase was due to the introduction of plain packaging.  The researchers found it was not attributable to other causes, such as anti-tobacco advertising or cigarette price increases. </p><p>The UK has now announced that it is minded to introduce regulations to provide for standardised packaging following a short consultation.  This consultation was initiated on 26th June.  As the Deputy will be aware, Australia was the first country in the world to introduce this measure in December 2012 and we are in on-going contact with our Australian colleagues to ensure our initiative benefits from their experience.  New Zealand initiated the legislative process to introduce standardised packaging in February 2014, and Scotland has also indicated its intention to follow suit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-01a.1307.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070100076#WRY02300"><p>The rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is universally recognised at global, European and national levels as one of the greatest potential threats to human and animal health with possible serious consequences for public health.  The emergence of resistance is a normal biological phenomenon, but the extensive use, misuse and overuse of antimicrobials (antibiotics) in both human and animal health have increasingly raised levels of antimicrobial resistance &ndash; in all countries and in patients of all age groups; with increasing travel and trade, drug resistance can spread rapidly.  The societal and financial costs of treating antimicrobial-resistant infections places a significant burden on society and patients infected with drug-resistant organisms are more likely to remain in hospital for a longer period of time and to have a poor prognosis. </p><p>Ireland welcomes and has supported the leadership and work of the WHO over many years in addressing the impact of the overuse of antibiotics, specifically the work of the WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Antimicrobial Resistance which recommends that the WHO should lead the development and coordination of a global action plan on antimicrobial resistance and the publication in April 2014 by the Organisation of its first global report on antibiotic resistance: Antimicrobial Resistance Global Report on Surveillance 2014.  Ireland and the EU fully supported the passing of the AMR Resolution at the WHO's 67<sup>th</sup>World Health Assembly in May 2014 which stressed the need for global action under WHO leadership.</p><p>In Ireland the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR has been a significant patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health for several years.  A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years including improved surveillance of infections and prescribing, infection prevention and control processes, antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness raising and with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.</p><p>The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in the control and prevention of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) (which arise in part from the overuse of antibiotics) for a number of years, including:</p><p>- SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland) which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001.</p><p>- HSE 'Say No to Infection' which focused on both HCAIs and AMR, launched in 2007</p><p>- The RCPI (Royal College of Physicians of Ireland) &amp;amp; HSE National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010 to provide expert advice nationally</p><p>- Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals </p><p>- HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012</p><p><i>- S. aureus </i>bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital</p><p>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)</p><p>Ireland reports to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARS-Net) and to ESAC, the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption in Europe.  All Irish hospital labs participate in EARS-Net, representing 100% coverage of the population.</p><p>The overall aim of the National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR, referenced above, is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance.  Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients, these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients/residents/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented.</p><p>As I have stated in the House on previous occasions, the prevention HCAIs and colonisation/infection of  patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms  such as MRSA is one of my priorities in protecting patient safety.  HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased healthcare costs.  The prevalence of MRSA has dropped considerably in recent years.  There has been a decrease of 62.5% in reported cases of MRSA from 2006 to 2013 and the downward trend appears to be holding for the first quarter of 2014 (figures are provisional). </p><p>While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland, MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland.  It must be noted that  there are concerns about the rates of resistance of other organisms and ongoing high antimicrobial consumption.  The most recent European Antimicrobial Surveillance System Report (EARS - Net) for Quarter 1, 2014 was published on June 25th.  The full Report is available at .</p><p>In December last I launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA).  This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes/long stay residential units and the community.  A third national Guideline on Surveillance, Diagnosis and Management of Clostridium <i>difficile </i>Infection in Ireland was launched in June 2014.</p><p>I might add that I have ensured that Patient Safety has been made a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.</p></reply>

The data are derived from the Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) system which records details on each in-patient and daycase discharge from all publicly-funded acute hospitals.  It should be noted that if a patient is admitted more than once for a specific condition, each admission is counted separately in HIPE.  For this reason, the figures should not be interpreted as prevalence estimates for these conditions (data for 2013 are provisional).<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2004</th><th>2005</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013*</th></tr><tr><td>Anaphylactic shock due to adverse food reaction</td><td>44</td><td>33</td><td>45</td><td>43</td><td>58</td><td>55</td><td>60</td><td>63</td><td>62</td><td>65</td></tr></table></p><p>As the remaining queries raised by the Deputy are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to her directly.</p></reply>

In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of &euro;2.5m capital funding was provided to enable the hospital to provide facilities for ambulatory care of people with cystic fibrosis.  </p><p>  This enabled the provision of the new dedicated Outpatient facility for patients with CF which facilitates a comprehensive range of services from the multidisciplinary teams; these include outpatient clinics, a drop in centre / base for clinical assessments with medical consultants and nurses, and the provision of treatments that would otherwise have required hospitalisation; for example, infusions and antibiotic therapies, assessment of pulmonary function, physiotherapy, dietetics and psychology.  </p><p>  The consultation and treatment rooms have air filtration rooms which facilitate 12 air changes per hour, approximately three times the average rate in a normal room.  This benefit reduces the time needed between patients for the purposes of infection control. This facility opened on October 26, 2010. </p><p>  St Paul's Ward is the specialist respiratory ward in the hospital, on which the single rooms are for elective admission of patients with CF for prophylactic antibiotic therapy (or other treatment as required). With priority access to a number of en-suite inpatient rooms, adults with CF are rarely admitted as in-patients via the Emergency Department.</p><p>  In discussion with the National Clinical Care Programme and the clinical team on-site, it has been identified that due to the increase in numbers within the service there is a requirement for an increase in in-patient single-room accommodation for our CF patients. Arrangements are being finalised to provide this within the hospital&rsquo;s existing infrastructure.  </p><p>  With regard to longer-term plans, the hospital is engaging with the HSE in relation to the overall infrastructure related requirements to best meet growing service demands.  The requirements for CF patients will form an integral part of these discussions.</p></reply>

It is implemented as a precaution against the risk of transmission of vCJD through  blood transfusion. There is no test for vCJD and confirmation  that someone had the disease is only possible post mortem.  The incidence of vCJD, and of BSE, in Northern Ireland, while lower than in parts of the UK, was higher than that in the Republic of  Ireland.   </p><p>  Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of healthcare delivery.  The remit of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is to provide a safe, reliable and robust blood service to the Irish health system. The IBTS keeps its eligibility criteria for blood donation under on-going review, working closely with blood services internationally.</p></reply>

However, I understand that the manufacturer of Fampyra supplied the drug free of charge to some patients who were prescribed the drug by their clinician.  The manufacturer has recently decided to stop supplying the drug free of charge and, as a consequence, these patients are now faced with financing the drug themselves if they wish to continue with this drug treatment.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes.  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine (Fampyra&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  </p><p>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website ().</p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes.  However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS.  The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the product which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs scheme.  The HSE has met with Biogen Idec recently to discuss a potential revised application.  The HSE expects that Biogen Idec will submit a revised application.  The HSE will then re-consider the application in as timely a fashion as possible in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.  The conditions covered by the LTI Scheme are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered under the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

The consultation on the review extended to all interested parties and there was an appropriate contribution from stakeholders, including dispatch operators, drivers, consumers and the regulatory and enforcement agencies.</p><p>  The regulation of the SPSV sector is a matter for the NTA under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act, 2013. I have no plans to undertake any further review of the sector at this time.</p><p>  The recent spate of carjackings, including taxi carjackings, is a very concerning development. The matter is to be raised at the next Ministerial Road Safety Committee meeting. I have also asked the NTA to conduct a consultation process around driver safety, as committed to in the Taxi Regulation Review.</p></reply>

The bulk of the funding is required for rail safety and renewal. However the Plan did include funding for new rail stations at Kishogue, Hansfield, Oranmore and Crusheen.  To date Hansfield and Oranmore stations have been opened while planning issues and other delays have hampered progress at both Kishogue and Crusheen.  Capital funding for Irish Rail was also reduced in 2012 to support the emergency funding required by the CIE Group at that time.  This led to a re-prioritisation of the heavy rail capital projects and to a longer delivery time line for some projects including the new rail stations.    Preparatory work on a new government capital investment plan to 2019 has begun. This will involve a focused review of the current plan and take account of investment priorities for the next five years. If additional funds are available over and above what is required to maintain existing assets  there will be many competing transport projects across all modes. Only projects for which there is a clear identifiable need, which are affordable, have a robust business case and add value to existing infrastructure, will be prioritised for funding in the new capital plan.</p><p>  That is why I have asked Irish Rail to revisit their current proposals for Crusheen rail stop which have a construction cost in the order of &euro;2 million and see if a lower cost alternative is feasible. It is my intention to provide for a rail stop at Crusheen.</p></reply>

This came at no cost to the Exchequer. The State is not in a position to compel such a measure for flight schools. However, the scale of the fees involved in language training is significantly less than that for flight training.  </p><p>  Following the collapse of PTC in 2012, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) also made every effort to assist the students of the college to complete their training at a reasonable cost through its engagement with the relevant training providers in Florida and here in Ireland. The IAA secured the records of the students and all flight and ground training carried out in Florida up to then, ensuring accreditation towards student&rsquo;s final qualifications where possible.  In addition, the IAA funded and helped facilitate, on a once-off basis, the repatriation to Ireland of those students who were training in Florida.</p><p>  The responsibility of the IAA for flight training organisations extends to the oversight of the safety, quality and standard of the training being delivered, and the conduct of examinations and flight tests to the appropriate EU standard. This includes whether a company has sufficient resources to safely provide the training required to the internationally determined standards. However, the IAA has no involvement in, or responsibility for, overseeing the financial viability of the company or the contractual arrangements between pilot training centres and students.</p><p>  The failure of the Pilot Training College (PTC) in Waterford to meet its contractual obligations to students is a matter of company law and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is the appropriate body to investigate any alleged breaches of company law.</p></reply>

The Coast Guard carries out this function utilising its own assets and declared resources, and regularly provides assistance to the Garda&iacute; across the country. As the Deputy can appreciate, resources available to my Department must be allocated to fulfil its primary responsibility of maritime search and rescue, pollution response and salvage.     However, I recognise the important role that other voluntary organisations play, in particular in providing support to those people partaking in activities such as trekking. Indeed adventure sports are getting more popular by the year and play an increasingly important role in tourism. In recognition of the role that mountain rescue teams in particular provide in supporting participation in these sports, I was very pleased to be in a position to announce a special once-off sports capital allocation of &euro;200,000 to mountain rescue services. These funds are to be used for the modernisation of vehicles and equipment.</p></reply>

Since this date the staff of the former NEWB, including its Education Welfare Officers (EWOs), have transferred to the new Agency. The three service strands formerly under the remit of NEWB &ndash; the statutory Educational Welfare Service and the school support programme services (Home-School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme) under the DEIS strategy &ndash; collectively form the Educational Welfare Services of the new Agency. Within the Agency, the statutory Education Welfare Service has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The appointment of EWOs is a function of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  I have been advised that the position of EWO in North Kildare became vacant as a result of a retirement in February 2012. I have also been advised that arrangements have been in place since the 2012/2013 academic year so that the 107 schools in the area have continued to have access to support from the Education Welfare Service. Currently support is being provided by the Senior EWO along with other officers of the service. The Agency has advised me that it has become necessary to prioritise those cases where students are out of school, expelled or have special education needs in complex situations. </p><p>  The Agency has further advised me that a reorganisation of Educational Welfare Services in the greater Dublin area, is being undertaken at present, within available resources, with a view to providing an improved service in a number of areas including North Kildare.</p><p>  Vacancies that arise in staffing in the front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving are kept under review and are prioritised by the Agency, in consultation with my Department, in so far as is possible, working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment.</p></reply>

While I am anxious to improve the legal basis for access to adoption records, proposals to Government have to reflect the constraints on the Legislature in providing such access if they are not to fall foul of Constitutional challenge. The Office of the Attorney General has provided comprehensive legal advice to the Department that has assisted in identifying the Constitutional parameters within which the Heads of the Bill have to be drafted. The most difficult situations to address within the proposed legislation are those where the consent of other parties, such as natural mothers, does not exist for the release of information. </p><p>  It is intended to proceed to finalise legislative proposals so that I may bring proposals to the Government as soon as possible.

The SCP is a targeted intervention aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. </p><p>  As with all major spending programmes, the School Completion Programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014.</p><p>  Since its establishment the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme  , including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. I am advised that proposals have yet to be formulated by the Agency in relation to the funding for School Completion Programme projects in the coming 2014/2015 academic year. As an initial step the Agency invited all School Completion Programme Projects to commence planning for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters. The Agency has commenced the detailed process of evaluating and approving the 2014/2015 school retention plans for individual projects. It is anticipated that the Agency will advise projects of the outcome of the process and of their allocations in time for the start of the new school year. The Agency will continue to work closely with Local Management Committees, schools and local School Completion Programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process.</p><p>  The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to this programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the estimates and budgetary process having regard to the resources available to Government.</p></reply>

Special Care Units differ from ordinary residential care in that the Units offer higher staff ratios, on-site education as well as specialised input such as psychology and child psychiatric services. The child is not detained as a result of criminal offences, but is placed by a High Court Order.</p><p>  There are three Special Care Units in the country which are operated by the Agency under a single national governance arrangement. They are Ballydowd in Dublin for girls and boys, Gleann Alainn in Cork which is for girls only and Coovagh House in Limerick for boys only.  At any one time approximately 0.3% of all children in care are detained in the three Special Care Units.  As of 26th June 2014 there were 16 children placed in the Special Care Units and  four young people awaiting a placement.  The current average length of wait is approximately 5-weeks. </p><p>  These Units are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority with positive findings from the most recent inspections undertaken in 2013. </p><p>  As part of the Child and Family Agency's commitment to develop a comprehensive continuum of care services to meet the divergent and complex needs of all children in care, Crann&oacute;g Nua High Support Unit in Portrane is to be redesignated to function as a Special Care Unit.  I am advised that the last child left Crann&oacute;g Nua on 23rd June 2014.  There are approximately 30 days remaining in the tendering process for the appointment of a construction team who will provide the upgrade of the current buildings and an additional new build residential unit, to enable the Centre to provide secure care.  The Agency has advised me that in excess of &euro;1m has been allocated to progress national special care development projects for 2014 and discussions are underway regarding further significant amounts required in 2015 and future years.</p><p>  The Agency has advised that eight special care beds will be provided at Crann&oacute;g Nua by the end of June 2015 and a further four beds will be provided there by the end of October 2015.  These timescales refer to the current indicated Building Programme and may be subject to change.</p></reply>

This brought order to what had been the system of ad-hoc arrangements in lieu of formal adoption procedures up to this point. All adoptions, which the Irish state has been involved in since 1952 have been carried out in line with this and subsequent adoption legislation.  However historic private arrangements for obvious reasons and due to social factors of the era, operated in conditions of great secrecy and there were rarely any contemporary written records of these events. Similarly, the issue of illegal adoptions relates to illegal registrations, i.e., children who were given at birth to other individuals who registered these children as their own and who are now unable to access personal records and information.  The issue of illegal registrations of births are a matter for the General Registration Office which is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection however the Adoption Authority of Ireland may also be able to provide assistance in this regard.</p><p>  Records in relation illegal birth registrations, where such records exist, are currently held by a number of  agencies, including the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Child and Family Agency  and also by private adoption agencies,  maternity hospitals, private individuals and other sources. Information held by the Adoption Authority is primarily in relation to adoptions which took place since the Adoption Act 1952.  The Authority  has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s  Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records. </p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register which is operated by the Adoption Authority was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register  in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact  with another party sometime in the future. Fundamental to the success of the Register is that any persons with information in this regard contact the Information and Tracing Unit of the Adoption Authority.</p><p>  My Department is continuing to work on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible.  While the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to give a comprehensive account of the provisions of the proposed legislation until the Heads of Bill have been agreed by Government, I can say that the issues in relation to illegal registrations are being considered as part of the drafting process.  </p></reply>

As part of the ongoing progression of the Early Years Quality Agenda, it was announced last year that by September 2015 all staff working directly with children in the 0-6 years age category in early years services would have to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification.  This requirement applies to new services from September 2014.</p><p>  In addition to the general requirement for a Level 5 qualification, preschool leaders delivering the free preschool provision to children in the age category 3 years 2 months to 4 years 7 months under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will have to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent, by September 2015. </p><p>  In March this year the launch of a Learner Fund to assist existing staff working  in the childcare sector to meet the new requirements was announced.   The objective of the  funding is to ensure that all existing staff are in a position to meet the minimum Level 5 qualification requirement to enable them to continue to work in the childcare sector and that staff seeking to fill the role of Pre-school Leader under the ECCE programme are assisted to obtain the required Level 6 qualification.  </p><p>  The Learner Fund, which is being administered by Pobal with the help of local City and County Childcare Committees, has a total allocation of &euro;3 million for the years 2014 and 2015 and will be targeted to subsidise the cost for childcare staff who are required to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses. </p><p>  A panel of more than 50 training providers has been approved to deliver the training programmes and applications for support from staff in the childcare sector are currently being assessed and training will commence in September this year. </p><p>  My Department does provide a higher rate of capitation to childcare services participating in the ECCE programme that employ preschool leaders who hold qualifications at Level 7 or higher.  However, the priority for my Department is to ensure that all childcare staff are supported to obtain the minimum qualification required for employment in the childcare sector and the introduction of a graduate staffing fund for employees is not being considered. </p></reply>

It does this through interagency collaboration and by developing innovative community-based models to respond to local needs.  NEYAI works across a number of thematic areas with a strong focus on S&iacute;olta - the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education (CECDC, 2006) and Aistear - the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework (NCCA, 2009). Both of these are seen as fundamental to the growth and development of quality in the provision of early years care and education. The rights of the child are the primary focus of NEYAI, as it aims to ensure that each child is given the opportunity to reach his or her full potential and that obstacles to the realisation of this goal can be addressed in policy and practice.</p><p>All projects are now moving into their final phase of implementation and are exploring legacy, sustainability and related dissemination activities to ensure policy engagement, in conjunction with the NEYAI Learning Community and at individual-project level.</p><p>The NEYAI Initiative is now coming to a close, but the Projects have different end dates &ndash; two concluded in April, four will conclude in July and five in August. </p><p>On the 23 of May last, the NEYAI National Conference presented the final NEYAI National Evaluation report. The findings from both the national evaluation report and each of the projects local evaluations will be taken into account, as part of the development of the National Early Years Quality Support Service. This new national initiative will be a dedicated service provided on a national basis. The objective of the National Early Years Quality Support Service is to enhance the quality of practice in early childhood care and education settings and developing their capacity to provide high quality early education and care experiences for children and their families, This will be achieved by effective coordination of state funded support services available to this sector, one of which will be a new specialist support service. A recruitment process for a National Manager for this service is currently underway.</p><p><b>Area-Based Childhood (ABC) Programme</b></p><p>The Area-Based Childhood (ABC) Programme is an innovative initiative announced in the Programme for Government which will run from 2013 &ndash; 2016.  It reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to adopt an area-based approach to help reduce child poverty by improving outcomes for children. </p><p>The ABC programme targets investment in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in areas of disadvantage. It aims to break <i>&ldquo;the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions&rdquo;</i>in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage.   </p><p>The ABC Programme is being jointly funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.   The total amount of funding available in the period 2013-2016 will be &euro;29.7m.</p><p>50 applications, from among the most disadvantaged areas of the State, were received from consortia wishing to participate in the ABC Programme.  On 27 November last my Department announced that 13 areas had been approved   for entry into the new ABC Programme these included the three existing projects which participated in the forerunner Prevention and Early Intervention  programme (PEIP) in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale which had already been approved for entry into the new ABC Programme. </p><p>Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services are managing the programme on behalf of my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  Four sites have recently been &lsquo;fast tracked&rsquo; and are ready to proceed to contract stage. The remaining sites have been asked to submit further proposals.  The overall aim is to have all of the new sites contracted by end 2014. </p></reply>

While I am anxious to improve the legal basis for access to adoption records, proposals to Government have to reflect the constraints on the Legislature in providing such access if they are not to fall foul of Constitutional challenge. The Office of the Attorney General has provided comprehensive legal advice to the Department that has assisted in identifying the Constitutional parameters within which the Heads of the Bill have to be drafted. The most difficult situations to address within the proposed legislation are those where the consent of other parties, such as natural mothers, does not exist for the release of information. </p><p>  It is intended to proceed to finalise legislative proposals so that I may bring proposals to the Government as soon as possible.  Subsequent consideration by the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee will allow the issues to be carefully examined and the views of different interested parties on these important and sensitive matters to be fully considered.  </p></reply>

In 2013 the HSE spent over &euro;17 million on the provision of domestic and sexual violence services. </p><p>  This included the funding of 60 services throughout the country comprising:-</p><p>  - &euro;10m for 20 Crisis Refuges</p><p>  - Over &euro;4 million for 16 Rape Crisis Centres </p><p>  - Almost &euro;3.5 million for 24 Support Services. </p><p>  Funding in 2014 for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence Services has been retained at 2013 levels. </p><p>  Rape Crisis Network Ireland had a two year service level agreement with the HSE which expired on 31st December, 2013, but was extended to 31st March, 2014 to allow for establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the appointment of a Programme Manager for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence Services and to enable the Agency to tender for future support services to support frontline agencies.   The Agency has advised that this contract has now been extended, with revised conditions to the end of 2014.</p><p>  In addition to the network support that Rape Crisis Network Ireland provides to sexual violence support services, the Child and Family Agency is working with the Network on a work programme that will support developments across the sexual violence services sector. </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency is currently undertaking a review of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence service provision and will be developing a strategic plan later in 2014, to support the delivery of effective and accessible services over the coming years.  In line with Government policy, the focus in identifying strategic priorities for Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services is on achieving demonstrable value for money and ensuring that funding for frontline services is maximised to meet the needs of the adults, children and families who use these services.</p><p>  Requirements for provision of longer-term support for frontline services are being considered as part of the review. The National Programme Manager for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence Services in the Agency will work with the Agency Head of Procurement to establish a tender process, due to begin in September, for longer-term provision of support to front-line agencies from 2015.  All qualified providers, including the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, may tender for this new contract.</p></reply>

As part of the ongoing progression of the Early Years Quality Agenda, it was announced last year that by September 2015 all staff working directly with children in the 0-6 years age category in early years services would have to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification.  This requirement will apply to new services from September 2014.</p><p>  In addition to the general requirement for a Level 5 qualification, preschool leaders delivering the free preschool provision to children in the age category 3 years 2 months to 4 years 7 months under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will have to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent, by September 2015. </p><p>  In March this year the launch of a Learner Fund to assist existing staff working  in the child care sector to meet the new requirements was announced.   The objective of the  funding is to ensure that all existing staff are in a position to meet the minimum Level 5 qualification requirement to enable them to continue to work in the child care sector and that staff seeking to fill the role of Pre-school Leader under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are assisted to obtain the required Level 6 qualification.  </p><p>  The Learner Fund, which is being administered by Pobal with the help of local City and County Childcare Committees, has a total allocation of &euro;3 million for the years 2014 and 2015 and will be targeted to subsidise the cost for child care staff who are required to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses. </p><p>  A panel of more than 50 training providers has been approved to deliver the training programmes.  The priority is to ensure that support is available to the existing staff who must meet the new qualification requirements.  Over 2,200 applications for support from staff in the child care sector are currently being assessed and training will commence in September this year.</p></reply>

The Committee is engaged with my Department on the development of the new National Youth Strategy for completion later this year.</p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet, regularly with many youth organisations and groups to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p></reply>

This comprises over &euro;955 million in current funding and &euro;42 million in capital funding.  When Appropriations in Aid are taken into account, the net current funding allocated to my Department in 2014 is some &euro;974.3 million.  This level of funding (&euro;997m) represents an increase of over &euro;558 million on the 2013 Estimate of &euro;439 million and the significant investment shows that, while operating within the difficult Budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reforms and service developments to support children and families.  I would also point out that my Department has received an additional &euro;5m capital allocation under the stimulus programme which will allow for increased capital expenditure which will further benefit children.</p><p>  I consider that the estimate provision for my Department will facilitate the delivery of a significant level of public services along with a number of new policy measures that include:</p><p>  - The establishment of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) which took effect on 1st January 2014.  Tusla have an allocation of &euro;609 million, including &euro;7m in capital provision.  This allocation is for the continuing provision of services previously administered by the Health Service Executive (H.S.E.), National Education Welfare Board (NEWB), and the Family Support Agency (FSA).  The overall level of funding which is significant by any measure, will help the agency respond to demand and to the needs of clients.  It will help to improve both the level and the quality of services.</p><p>  - An additional &euro;4 million to support implementation of the Pre-School Quality Agenda which seeks to support high standards through supporting the efforts of providers and their staff in delivering improved and more reliable quality; and to respond to concerns raised by parents;</p><p>  - An increase of &euro;1.5 million in funding to address child poverty through the new Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme. This will bring to &euro;4 million the State funding to be invested in this initiative in 2014.   The total budget allocation for the programme over the period 2013 &ndash; 2016 is almost &euro;30 million.  </p><p>  - &euro;31m in capital funding to facilitate the continuation of construction work on the new Children Detention School facilities in Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin. The timeline for the project will see the first three residential units available in the third quarter of 2014 and will be prioritised for the transfer of 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, currently in St Patrick`s Institution. </p><p>  Other important areas being supported in 2014 are the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which has a funding provision of &euro;175 million. Some 4,300 preschool services are participating in the programme and approximately 68,000 children are currently benefiting from it. In addition, in excess of &euro;50 million is also being made available to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services by the voluntary youth sector for all young people including those in disadvantaged communities.</p></reply>

Where appropriate, children who are in need of care and protection are received into the care of the State under the Child Care Act, 1991.</p><p>The placement of children in care is governed by Regulations.  These provide, inter alia, for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions.  The Regulations also provide that the Social Worker oversees the implementation of the Care Plan, visits the child and sees them in private and reads the records about the child where the child is living in a residential centre.</p><p>Children depending on their identified need may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, residential care, high support, special care or other placement types.  The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and over 92% of children are placed in foster care. </p><p>All children's services are inspected against Regulations and National Standards.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) inspect Residential Centres run by the Child and Family Agency including Special Care Units.  The Child and Family Agency registers and inspects residential care in the private and voluntary sector. HIQA also inspects Child Protection and Welfare Services and Foster Care Services. </p><p>In 2013 my Department received 61 Children's Services Inspection Reports from HIQA. I welcome and endorse this important role played by HIQA in assuring the work within children's services to promote the safety, wellbeing and welfare in their care.</p><p>Where required, children and their carers may need additional services outside of those provided by the Agency, such as Speech and Language Therapy and Child and Adult Mental Health Services. The Agency and the Health Service Executive have developed a Memorandum of Understanding which  details cross agency shared services and mutual commitments including clinical and care services. </p><p>All children in care have rights set out in the National Standards, these include consultation, access to information and the right to complain.</p></reply>

These include advice and guidance for families. For example, www.webwise.ie - an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills- provides information and advice for parents and teachers about risks and how to protect children against cyber bullying.  At community level, many of the voluntary youth services funded by my Department provide education programmes, run awareness campaigns about bullying and provide programmes for young people to give them the knowledge and skills to build supportive links and counter bullying behaviours.</p><p>  The new procedures under the Action Plan for Bullying, led by the Department of Education and Skills, which place a requirement on all schools to address incidences of bullying are highly relevant to the contexts of young people&rsquo;s lives and  not only in the school setting. They  specifically include incidences of cyber-bullying that occur both in and out of the school context and the posting of hurtful messages, images or statements on social media sites, within the definition of bullying. They highlight the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely and to know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities.  The Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. </p><p>  Under Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children serious incidents of bullying should be reported to the Child and Family Agency. I have been advised that, in such cases and where it is required, appropriate support will be put in place, In addition to support for the family and the child or young person, which can be provided by the Child and Family Agency, there are services provided by the HSE, including the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services,which may be relevant depending on the nature of the condition being experienced by a child or young person. </p><p>  My Department continues to work with other departments, child care services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people, to improve access to information and support for them and their families and to advance measures to combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

These comprise 6 places for girls up to the age of 18 on admission and 40 places for boys up to the age of 17 on admission.  Boys aged 17 on being ordered to be detained are currently accommodated by the Irish Prison Service.  This practice will cease, meeting the commitment in the Programme for Government to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, when new children detention facilities currently being constructed on the Oberstown campus become available before the end of this year.  </p><p>  Construction on the project commenced on site in September 2013 and the first new residential units, which will prioritise the provision of residential places for 17 year old boys ordered to be detained, will be delivered in fourth quarter of 2014. The project will also deliver associated education, recreation, visiting, medical and other ancillary facilities. It is planned that the project will be fully completed during 2015.</p><p>  The services currently being delivered in the children detention schools and the enhanced services which will be supported by the new facilities being developed focus on education and rehabilitation of the young people detained in order to minimise re-offending and to support their early re-integration into the community.   Each young person is assessed on admission to determine his/her need for specialist therapeutic interventions and to develop an individualised management plan which might include addressing offending behaviour, family therapy and other relevant programmes.  The Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board provide delivery of education services to the young people in detention including up to State examination level.</p></reply>

The Act transferred the statutory function in relation to child welfare and protection of the Health Services Executive to the Agency. The Act also emphasises the need for Agency accountability.  This is so that the public can be confident that the services provided by the Agency result in the best possible outcomes for the children concerned.</p><p>  The Department's oversight function is exercised through a range of interactions with colleagues in the Agency.  These interactions are often formal and structured at a number of levels but there is also a good level of informal contact between the Department and the Agency on a daily basis relating to services.
