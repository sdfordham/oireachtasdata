    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-21a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042100038#WRA00400"><p>The Department, including through its Homeless Persons Unit and Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit in Dublin, works collaboratively with local authorities, Government agencies and the voluntary sector in assisting homeless persons to access private rented accommodation.  This ensures that, where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.  Department officials throughout the country are actively engaged at a local level with the Homeless Action Teams (HATs) and Non-Government Organisations working in the area of homelessness and its prevention. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s rent supplement scheme plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 57,600 people for which the Government has provided approximately &euro;267 million for 2016.  There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 3,000 during the first three months of 2016 showing that significant numbers of individuals and families are being accommodated under the scheme. </p><p>The Department has implemented a national targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this arrangement to commuter areas over the coming weeks.  This flexible and targeted approach has assisted over 7,570 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rental payments.  A county breakdown of these cases is provided in the table for information.</p><p>The strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to the local authorities.  The Department is fully engaged in the roll out of this scheme which is operational in 19 local authority areas and officials continue to work closely with colleagues in the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p><p>I believe these measures and the recent legislative reforms announced to the private rental sector provide a level of stability for those who require support in what has become a highly volatile rental market.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement </b><b>- Increased Rental Payments by County as at 18/04/2016</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>35</td><td></td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>22</td><td></td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>349</td><td>73</td><td>422</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>3,003</td><td>1,958</td><td>4,961</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>155</td><td></td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>51</td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>353</td><td></td><td>353</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>127</td><td></td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>112</td><td></td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>64</td><td></td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>128</td><td></td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>122</td><td></td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>294</td><td></td><td>294</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>24</td><td></td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>165</td><td></td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>39</td><td></td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>173</td><td></td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>15</td><td></td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>177</td><td></td><td>177</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td>5,539</td><td>2,031</td><td>7,570</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-21a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042100038#WRA00900"><p>The State pension (contributory) is one of the State pension schemes, and its rate of payment is related to contributions made over years into the Social Insurance Fund.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of <i>10 years</i>of paid contributions.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate.  </p><p>Working part-time does not generally reduce entitlement, as part-time workers also pay weekly PRSI contributions, and these will generally be of equal value to the more expensive contributions paid by full-time workers.</p><p>However absences from the labour force - when contributions were neither deducted from pay nor credited in respect of a social welfare payment, and where voluntary contributions were not made &ndash; may impact upon the rate of a person&rsquo;s pension.  This can be mitigated by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for some people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994 and took effect for such homemaking periods from that date, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  It should be noted however that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions must also be satisfied. </p><p>If someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p></reply>

This advance process facilitates an efficient service to these customers and allows for speedy processing of their claim when the period of unemployment actually arises.  However, it is important to note that educational sector workers are still required to sign on for each period of unemployment.</p>  <p>  Initially, when a person makes an application for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, 3 waiting days apply and payment is made from the 4th day of the claim where there is no accrued holiday entitlement.  If, however, a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply.  </p>  <p>  In general, there is no delay in processing jobseeker benefit claims in Intreo Centres if the relevant claim application forms and supporting documentation are completed, as required by the customer in a timely manner.  On average, a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim is decided within one week of application.</p>  <p>  Regarding the person referred to by the Deputy, the period of her unemployment was from 17 March 2016 to 5 April 2016.  She had 3 waiting days applied at the start of her claim and was paid for 2 days holidays.  She received &euro;250.67 and is due an additional &euro;125.33 which will issue to her shortly.</p></reply>

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.</p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week.  Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  </p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.</p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the department is that the vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. </p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices, they are issued directly to the department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post. </p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment.  The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.</p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.  Customers, if they wish, may continue to receive cheque payments in the medium term.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 415,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.  I am not in a position to extend the criteria for these schemes or the current value of the allowances. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources &ndash; this may include exceptional heating costs.  </p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.

However, I can advise the Deputy that the great majority of Scope decisions are made on foot of a request from the employed person or an employer, rather than arising from an investigation by the Department.  These decisions involve mainly company directors, partnership cases, public sector employees and family employments.</p><p>The following table shows the total number of decisions made in each of the years from 2006 to date.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Decisions</th></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>1397</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>1367</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1672</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1835</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1622</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1143</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>823</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1517</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1275</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1071</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (to date)</td><td>253</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the issue of disguised employment, the Deputy should note that a working group comprising officials from the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners has been examining the issue.  In this context, a public consultation process on the use of intermediary type employment structures and self-employment arrangements, and their impact on tax and PRSI is underway.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was 31 March 2016 and over 20 submissions were received which are now being examined.</p><p>Where incidences of misclassification of workers as self-employed are detected, then arrears of PRSI are calculated and collected.  Where an employee has been misclassified as self-employed, their social insurance record will be updated to reflect the correct rate of social insurance.  Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences in relation to employment contributions, their remittance and the maintenance of prescribed wages and employment records.  On conviction, fines and or imprisonment can ultimately be imposed.</p><p>Departmental inspectors carry out visits to a wide range of businesses, as part of their on-going compliance operations.  In certain instances, inspections are undertaken jointly with other State agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.  Such inspections are fact-finding visits wherein evidence of compliance or non-compliance may be detected.  Where evidence of non-compliance or misclassification of employment status is detected, this will be pursued.  Where details of specific cases are supplied to the Department, they are investigated and the insurability of the person(s) concerned is determined.  A person&rsquo;s or company&rsquo;s employment status or compliance is confidential to that individual or entity.  In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that the Department cannot give specific details on the outcome of operations as that would contravene confidentiality and data protection requirements.</p></reply>

Persons who are exempt from VAT cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services incurred in relation to their business, such as bus purchases and fuel, tyre and garage expenses, used for the purposes of the person's coach and bus service. </p><p>Section 103 of the Value-Added Tax Act 2010 provides that the Minister for Finance may by order provide for a refund of VAT in certain circumstances.  The VAT (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order 2012 [SI 266/2012] provides for the refund to VAT-exempt coach operators, subject to certain conditions, of VAT paid on touring coaches of a certain age and dimension.  The conditions include that the coach operator is engaged in the business of the carriage for reward of tourists by road under contracts for group transport and that the vehicle meets the criteria set out for a qualifying vehicle as defined in the Order.  Where a bus operator and/or vehicle do not meet the criteria in the Refund Order there is no entitlement to claim back VAT incurred on the purchase of buses or coaches.  Further details are available on the Revenue website at the following link .</p><p>I should also advise you that under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme, organisations are entitled to claim a repayment of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) paid on specially constructed or adapted vehicles, which are used for the transport of Persons with Disabilities.  In order to qualify an organisation must be a charitable organisation within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009 and be entered in the register of charitable organisations pursuant to Part 3 of that Act.  It must also be chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons.  Full details of this scheme and how to apply are available on the Revenue website: .</p></reply>

However, the new credit is more targeted in that it is, in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child.  </p><p>I would point out that it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and, if necessary, re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system which allowed, under the OPFTC, multiple claims in respect of the same child was unsustainable. </p><p>The SPCCC is allowed in the first instance to an individual, referred to as the primary claimant, who proves that a qualifying child is resident with him or her for the whole or greater part of the year of assessment.  This targets the credit towards the parent or care giver that is providing the majority of the child care.</p><p>If the primary claimant does not wish to claim the SPCCC (for example if they do not have sufficient taxable income to use it fully), he or she may relinquish it in favour of a secondary claimant, provided the child resides with the secondary claimant for a period of not less than 100 days during the year of claim.</p><p>The Deputy may also recall that during Report Stage of Finance Bill 2014, an amendment was tabled proposing to allow for the partial transfer of the SPCCC to the non-principal carer parent, in cases where it is not utilised in full by the principal carer.  A review of the proposal was undertaken by my officials in 2015 and published in the Report on Taxation Expenditures available online at: .</p><p>This review identified that a transferable credit could only be effectively administered by Revenue with the full co-operation of the primary claimant, as it would require the primary claimant to file a tax return, provide information on the other parent (or secondary claimant) and consent to the release of personal information to the other parent (or secondary claimant).</p><p>As the SPCCC currently allows for the credit to be transferred in full to a qualifying secondary claimant with the consent of the primary claimant, I am satisfied that the SPCCC provides for an appropriate level of transferability to secondary claimants, taking into account the various issues identified in the published review.  I am also satisfied that the SPCCC is targeting limited resources to where they are most needed.</p></reply>

This repayment arrangement is referred to as a "salary sacrifice".  In these circumstances, section 118B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (the Act) provides that the remuneration foregone shall be exempt from tax.  This has the effect of reducing the cost of the Travel Pass to the employee by the amount of tax that would have been paid on the "sacrificed" income at the employee's marginal (i.e. highest) rate of tax.</p>  <p>  Where an employer provides a Travel Pass without charge to an employee, section 118(5A) of the Act provides that there is no benefit-in-kind charge on the employee in relation to cost of the Travel Pass. </p>  <p>  The relief is available to any employee where the employer elects to operate the scheme.

The former is simply the permitted fiscal space arising from applying the currently forecast benchmark growth rates to the projected expenditure aggregate for each year.  These amounts are not final and are based on my Department's projections for the GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins for each of the relevant years as set out in Budget 2016 (see Table A.8).  The actual GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins values used by the Commission to assess compliance with the rules each year beyond 2016 will be based on Commission estimates compiled in their Spring forecast, and in relation to the GDP deflator, the Autumn forecasts as well, each year.  </p><p>A further source of variance arises from the fact that the various factors are applied to the general government expenditure outturn, excluding some items such as interest and the level of cyclical unemployment expenditure.  With regard to cyclical unemployment, the Commission's estimates are based on their own data.  Therefore, outturn variances from the levels forecast in Budget 2016, which are likely in the course of implementation and due to the allocation of fiscal space to expenditure, is another source of uncertainty, albeit with a relatively limited impact. </p><p>The net fiscal space is the additional room available beyond spending assumptions included in the Budget's baseline spending projections set out in Table 10 on page C.22 whilst still complying with the upper limit under the Expenditure Benchmark.  These assumptions, which are set out in Table A9, include the annual cost of providing for demographic spending pressures together with a number of other anticipated elements such as the Public Capital Plan, the cost of the Lansdowne Road Agreement and a number of other calls on the Central Fund.  The annual cost of indexing the tax system at an annual full year cost of c. &euro;400m per annum is included in the baseline tax revenue figures in Table 10.  For illustrative purposes, the additional revenue generated from a political decision not to proceed with indexation is included in the discretionary revenue measures set out in Table A9.  Decisions on whether to proceed with indexation or introduce other tax measures each year will be a matter for decision by the Government.</p><p>A document outlining the 'Forthcoming Revisions to the Medium Term Budgetary Objective' was published on my Department's website on the 21 January 2016.  This explained that the European Commission was in the process of updating the minimum Medium-Term Objectives (MTOs) of Member States in line with the three-year evaluation cycle.  This process is now complete and, as anticipated by my Department, Ireland's minimum MTO is now -0.5 per cent of GDP instead of 0.0 per cent of GDP.  The change is due to the improvement in Ireland's debt ratio and other factors.  Should the MTO be readjusted to such a level in the forthcoming Stability Programme Update, it more likely that the MTO will be achieved earlier than  projected in Budget 2016.  This in turn would result in additional fiscal space in the region of &euro;1-1.5 billion in the year after the MTO is achieved.</p></reply>

This response is available on the Oireachtas website at</p><p>I am advised by NAMA that, through its loans, it has an exposure to 137 residential properties in County Kildare.  I am further advised that the overwhelming majority of these properties, 127 or 92%, are currently tenanted.  The remaining 10 properties are currently on the market for sale in accordance with NAMA's requirements that debtors and receivers openly market the sale of all properties through professionally accredited selling agents.  As I advised in last week's response to Parliamentary Question No. 73 of 14th April 2016, 88% of all NAMA-related residential property sales in Ireland have been in the form of individual sales to individual house buyers.  </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that, under an initiative that has seen NAMA facilitate, on a commercial basis, the delivery of over 2,100 social housing units nationally since 2012, NAMA made 298 residential properties available for social housing in Kildare.  The Housing Agency, which works with the relevant local authority, confirmed demand for 122 of these properties and 113 have already been delivered.  </p><p>A good example of this initiative is the delivery of 35 new two- and three-bed houses at Coneyboro, Athy, County Kildare, for social housing.  I am advised that these units were provided by NAMA through the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association.  The houses were made available to families from the Athy Town Council's housing waiting list.  The beneficiaries extended beyond these new residents as the 35 units were part of a larger, 400-unit development, which, prior to NAMA's involvement, had been in an unfinished estate.  In addition to making these units available for social housing, NAMA provided funding to complete works throughout the estate, including internal roads and green areas.</p></reply>

They may carry out flood alleviation works from their own resources or apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  </p><p>The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.  </p><p>No applications for funding from Cork County Council are currently to hand in the OPW, concerning the works referenced. </p><p>The core strategy for addressing areas of potentially significant flood risk nationally is the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  Youghal is one of 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) nationwide that are being assessed.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.</p><p>Under the South West CFRAM Study, draft predictive flood maps for Youghal AFA have been produced and were the subject of a Public Consultation Day in Youghal on 14 January, 2015.  The draft maps are now being finalised following the conclusion of the national statutory public consultation process on 23 December, 2015.  A further Public Consultation Day was held in Youghal on 10 March, 2016 to present and discuss preliminary options to manage the significant flood risks identified.  Following finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The Plans, which are scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Further information on the Programme is available on <i>www.cfram.ie. </i></p><p>The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans. </p></reply>

There are 33 multinational companies based in the North East, employing 4,556 people across the Region (Annual Employment Survey 2015).  Seven of these multinationals are located in Cavan, employing 1,165 staff.  County Cavan also has a strong indigenous industry base across a wide range of sectors.  There were 4,222 people employed in Enterprise Ireland-assisted companies in the county in 2015 (Annual Employment Survey 2015). This is a gain of 190 on the previous year.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland currently positions the North East as having strong clusters in international business services (eBay, PayPal, Liberty Mutual) and manufacturing (Becton Dickinson, Wellman, Abbott).  The presence of these international brands is an attraction when companies are considering locating to the North East.  IDA Ireland will continue to market Cavan to relevant FDI opportunities, enquiries and potential investors through the IDA network. </p>  <p>  The IDA Ireland lands in Killygarry consist of a c.17 hectare business and technology park.  There are currently c.11 hectares of serviced marketable land available on the park, which are currently zoned as &lsquo;industrial and employment&rsquo;.

Key targets in service of this overall goal are to achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region; a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses; an increase in the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019; and an increase of 300 to 500 in the numbers of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s<b></b>na Gaeltachta supported jobs in the North West. </p><p>Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, including active promotion of the tourism potential of the Lakelands Region, which includes Cavan and Monaghan. </p><p>Areas targeted for future growth include digital payments, cleantech and creative services. </p><p>Since the Plan was launched, focus has moved to putting in place a comprehensive implementation structure.  A Regional Implementation Committee has been established, composed of key stakeholders in the region who will work in concert with Enterprise Champions - nominated senior private sector representatives - to oversee and monitor progress.  The Implementation Committee will meet on 25 April to review progress on the delivery of the Plan&rsquo;s actions.  The first Progress Report on the implementation of the NE/NW Action Plan, covering the period to end-June 2016, will be completed and published in Q3 2016.</p><p>Key actions in the plan to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include the establishment of a North West Regional Skills Forum to ensure the flow of critical skills to enterprises in the region; collaboration between the Enterprise Agencies, the Education and Training Boards and Institutes of Technology to develop a marketing proposition around the Insurance and Technical Services cluster in the North West; and a Regional Innovation Forum for the North East/North West region to help support more companies to innovate and engage in R&amp;amp;D.</p><p>All regional Action Plans will be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next five years, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be made available over the next five years through three competitive calls to be administered by Enterprise Ireland.  These competitive calls are being targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support job creation across the regions.</p><p>On 22 January, a &euro;3m Regional Accelerator Scheme was launched, which aims ultimately to create more accelerator spaces in the regions where start-ups can locate their businesses and access supports.  It is targeted that a further &euro;3m will be leveraged with additional private sector investment to support this entrepreneurship initiative.  This Regional Accelerator Scheme was the first competitive initiative to be launched under the &euro;40m competitive regional jobs fund announced by the Government on 15 January.</p><p>Other elements of this fund to be rolled out over the coming months include:</p><p>- Opportunities to drive greater company/sector collaboration/clustering in the regions</p><p>- Driving procurement opportunities for start-ups and established small businesses</p><p>- Strengthening Third-level as a driver of regional enterprise</p><p>- Strengthening the start-up ecosystem locally.</p></reply>

Its <i>Local Roots, Global Reach</i>vision underlines the sector&rsquo;s unique regional position in the Irish economy, identifies smarter and greener ways to deliver sustainable growth and recommends actions to support economic development.  The Mid- East Region Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017 also has a specific focus on the importance of the agri food sector in the region.</p><p>State agencies, in particular Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia, have been active in supporting agri-food companies in and close to Naas, and this has contributed to six consecutive years of national growth in Irish food and drink exports to reach &euro;10.8 billion in 2015, that is 52% higher and &euro;3.7 billion more than in 2009. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland provides important programmes right through a company&rsquo;s development at start-up, scaling and growth stages.

Food Academy is run by Bord Bia, Supervalu and the Local Enterprise Offices with the specific objective of supporting small food producers at a local level by providing training and support.  Participating companies are provided with the necessary business, marketing skills and retailer knowledge to help them gain access to the Food Academy fixture in local Supervalu stores and selected participants may then work on an Advance programme, taking them fromlocal to regional and national supplier status.</p></reply>

The overall objective of this review was to ensure that there is a supportive financial environment underpinning the marine sector.  Following a tender process,  Indecon International Economic Consultants were engaged to carry out the review, under the aegis of a steering group, comprising representatives from the Department of Finance, Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of  Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  This review was published in October 2015 (on Budget Day) and officials of the Department of Finance are currently working with the relevant Departments to consider options arising from the Marine Tax Review.  One of the options which is being considered is a tax relief for fishermen similar to the seafarer's allowance.  The outcome of this work is expected to be discussed in advance of the Finance Bill later this year, and will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.</p></reply>

The rent allowance costs &euro;4,600 per officer per annum (inclusive of Employer's PRSI).</p><p>The Garda Commissioner who is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote has informed me that the annual cost to the Garda Vote, of reinstating the rent allowance for all recently attested Garda members would amount to &euro;1.8 million.  In addition, the annual costs of granting the rent allowance to existing student Garda&iacute; upon attestation would be a further &euro;1.4 million, giving a total for those recruited since recruitment recommenced in 2014 of &euro;3.2 million.  Obviously, that cost would increase by &euro;4,600 for every Garda recruited into the future. </p><p>In December 2010 the then Government approved the reduction by 10% of the incremental salary scale for new entrants to traditional recruitment grades in the public service, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to achieve a structural reduction in the cost of the public service.  Under the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement para. 2.31, the imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date was required to be addressed by the preparation of revised incremental salary scales for new entrants.  The pay scales now converge.  Accordingly, the current position in relation to pay for new recruits is that<font color="#181818"> trainee Garda&iacute; are supported while completing their 2 year BA in Applied Policing.  For the 32 week duration of phase 1 of their training they receive a</font>basic weekly allowance of &euro;184 and full board in the Garda College.  After 32 weeks they are fully attested and move onto the first point of the Garda incremental pay scale of &euro;23,750.  The incremental scale rises to &euro;42,138 per annum after 8 years with two further increments after 13 and 19 years' service which bring the maximum of the pay scale to &euro;45,793 per annum after 19 years.  It is important to recall that the Garda pay scale does not represent the full earnings of a Garda as it does not include any allowances.  Garda&iacute; assigned to frontline duties work the Garda Roster which attracts unsocial hours payments.  Such payments amount to between 25% and 30% of their earnings.  Even at the entry level of &euro;23,750 and the lower end of unsocial hours scale, this will add almost &euro;6,000 to the salary.  Other allowances may also be payable, as may overtime.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Lansdowne Road Agreement represents <font color="#181818">the agreed structure for industrial relations and pay within the public service</font>until 2018.  It provides for <font color="#181818">the gradual unwinding of the pay reduction measures imposed on public servants at a cost of &euro;844m over three years.  It is underpinned by the </font>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015  <font color="#181818"> (FEMPI).  All public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, have started to receive the benefits of that Agreement in the form of reductions in the rate of Pension Related Deduction (PRD) payable.  For the majority of public servants, in addition to the PRD benefits, there is a significant reduction, weighted in favour of the lower paid, of the pay reductions suffered under the 2009 FEMPI legislation.  These come in the form of increases in gross pay and are incorporated in the pay scale referred to above.</font></p><p>I recognise that public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, played a significant part in stabilising the public finances and bringing about the economic recovery and I understand their frustrations at the pace of pay restoration.  It is, however, essential that a prudent and sustainable approach is adopted given the current resources available and fiscal restraints on spending.</p></reply>

Temporary release is an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.</p><p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that any offender who breaches his or her conditions, including committing a criminal offence, may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute; or may be refused another period of reviewable temporary release.  If someone re-offends on temporary release, the matter of their prosecution is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider.  </p><p>If the person is returned to prison to serve the remaining part of their sentence as a result of breaching their temporary release conditions, this information forms part of the consideration by the Irish Prison Service of any future temporary release decisions that are taken in respect of that offender.  Behaviour on temporary release is one of the criterion to be considered as outlined in the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.  The Irish Prison Service work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service in respect of the monitoring, supervision and compliance of those on temporary release.</p><p>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that they do not collate information in the format requested by the Deputy.  However, the Irish Prison Service Recidivism study for 2009 shows that 2,304 persons out of a total of 7,509 that were released in that year went on to re-offend within the first 6 months of release.  As well as offences committed after expiration of sentence,<b></b>this figure also includes offences committed before their official release date and this would take account of crimes committed while on early release, day release, and compassionate release.  It also includes offences committed while in custody such as assaults and possession of mobile phones.</p><p>These figures were produced in partnership with the Central Statistics Office using a combination of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Irish Prison Service records, based on the Irish Crime Classification System (ICCS).  The study, which was published in December 2015, looked at the available data up to the end of 2012 to take account of the time to make a conviction and a broader 3 year analysis of recidivism.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of population, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The Drogheda District forms part of the Louth Division.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that on the 29 February 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 104 members, 20 Garda Reserves and 11 civilians assigned to Drogheda Garda District.  The tables set out the number and rank of Garda&iacute; in the Drogheda District on the 31 December 2010 - 2015 and on the 29 February 2016.</p><p>I am further informed that the work of local Garda&iacute; in the Louth Division is augmented by a number of Garda national units which are assisting with covert and overt operations targeting prolific criminals and dissidents who reside within and outside this jurisdiction.  Furthermore there is ongoing liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland under the auspices of an agreed Cross-Border Policing Strategy to continue the excellent levels of cooperation between both police services in addressing crime and terrorist activities in all its manifestations.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate it is vital that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is renewed in order to ensure that it has the capacity to provide effective and visible policing throughout the country.  With this objective in mind, there have been seven intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College since it was reopened in September 2014 giving a total intake of 700.  A further 450 will be taken in this year.  So far 395 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties in communities nationwide.  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that 18 of these newly attested members have been assigned to the Louth Division.  It is expected that a further 300 trainee Garda&iacute; will attest this year and it will be a matter for the Garda Commissioner to assign them as she considers appropriate.  I am assured that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;.  </p><p><b>Drogheda Garda District 2010</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Sgt.</th><th>Insp.</th><th>Supt.</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>A/Comm</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CLOUGHERHEAD</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>84</td><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>DUNLEER</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>109</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Drogheda Garda District 2011</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Sgt.</th><th>Insp.</th><th>Supt.</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>A/Comm</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CLOUGHERHEAD</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>82</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>DUNLEER</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>89</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>107</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Drogheda Garda District 2012</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Sgt.</th><th>Insp.</th><th>Supt.</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>A/Comm</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CLOUGHERHEAD</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>77</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>DUNLEER</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>84</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>102</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Drogheda Garda District 2013</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Sgt.</th><th>Insp.</th><th>Supt.</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>A/Comm</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CLOUGHERHEAD</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>76</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>DUNLEER</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>84</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>102</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Drogheda Garda District 2014</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Sgt.</th><th>Insp.</th><th>Supt.</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>A/Comm</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CLOUGHERHEAD</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>74</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>DUNLEER</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>81</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>101</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Drogheda Garda District 2015</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Sgt.</th><th>Insp.</th><th>Supt.</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>A/Comm</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CLOUGHERHEAD  </td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>79</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>DUNLEER</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>86</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>106</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Drogheda Garda District 2016</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Sgt.</th><th>Insp.</th><th>Supt.</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>A/Comm</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CLOUGHERHEAD</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA</td><td>79</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>DUNLEER</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>86</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>104</td></tr></table></p></reply>

While the Deputy will appreciate that the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance, I have brought his concerns in relation to Drogheda to the attention of the Garda authorities.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that while the most recent CSO Recorded Crime Statistics show an increase in burglary in Drogheda during 2015, the overall national figures show a very welcome reduction in the level of burglary crime.  In fact during the last three months of 2015 the national burglary rate reduced by 26.2% compared to the same period in 2014, and this trend is also reflected in the figures for Co Louth which shows a decrease of 24% insofar as the same period is concerned.  The onset of these significant trends coincides with with the launch of Operation Thor on 1 November 2015.</p><p>Operation Thor marks a significant step-up in the Garda response to burglaries and related crime and it is supported by a special allocation of in excess of &euro;5 million, including funding for Garda overtime which will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.  Furthermore, since 2012, an overall amount of &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015.  Investment will continue under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles as well as important investments in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.</p><p>The commitment to tackling burglary and other forms of crime is further underscored by the additional 600 new Garda&iacute; who will take up duty this year, bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.</p><p>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support prosecutions arising from the carefully considered Garda strategy to disrupt and oppose criminal activity under Operation Thor.</p></reply>

Allegations of abuse can be made against anyone, including foster carers, biological parents, family members, friends, professionals, other children and in some cases, people unknown to the child. </p>  <p>  The foster care regulations require an allocated social worker to meet with the child, in private, on a regular basis to talk with the child, including asking about any worries they may have and to work towards the child's ongoing happiness and progress in a placement.  Where an allegation or concern is made to a social worker by a child, it is their responsibility to ensure the concern is listened to and to respond accordingly.  The immediate safety of the child is always central in responding to any allegation of physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect.  Following an allegation the overall safety of the child is considered.  Where possible, they will remain with their foster carers to allow for stability and ongoing support in such circumstances.  The allocated social worker will also review the child's care plan and arrange for specialist assessments to determine what therapeutic or medical services are required. </p>  <p>  Support is provided to the child making the allegation by their social worker.  If one of the 7% of children in foster care without an allocated social worker (407 children at the end of January 2016) makes an allegation of abuse a social worker will be immediately allocated to ensure that all their needs are met and the proper support can be given in such difficult times.  Where abuse has been alleged by a child living in foster care, the link social worker will ensure the foster carers can support the child to the best of their ability.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla notifies all allegations of abuse to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  All children, not just children in care, who have been sexually abused have two distinct needs in relation to services.  The first need is timely access to specialist assessment, including, if necessary, medical/forensic services and where sexual abuse is validated, children need a therapeutic response shaped to their needs.  Their families and carers also need support and guidance at this time.  It is vital that all agencies involved in assessment, investigation and providing support and therapeutic services to children and their families work together.  The HSE, Tusla and CARI (a voluntary based organisation) along with others, provide counselling, therapeutic and family support to children who have been abused sexually. </p></reply>

Given that this is an operational matter, it is appropriate that it should be dealt with by the NMBI.  I have referred the Deputy's question to the NMBI for attention and direct reply.  If you have not received a reply from the NMBI within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office  and they will follow up the matter with them.</p>  <p>  However, I would like to advise the Deputy of a number of measures taken by the NMBI and to put the perceived registration delays in context.</p>  <p>  A significant volume of applications has been received by the NMBI, particularly during 2015.  Many of the applications received to date are incomplete whereby documents remain outstanding on a file and therefore cannot be progressed to review/assessment stage until required documents are received.  In addition, many applicants, unfortunately do not complete their application form fully therefore leading to delays in progressing an application through the system. </p>  <p>  The NMBI have put a number of contact channels in place for applicants following up on the progress of their application.  One such measure was introduced in October 2015 which  was the opening of a dedicated call centre line for overseas applicants.  This call centre is open  Monday through to Friday, 9.00am to 5.30pm.  The call centre can provide regular updates to overseas applicants on the current status of their application.  The NMBI has launched a new website during February 2016 which will have additional features for overseas applicants to include a facility to &ldquo;Track their Application&rdquo; on line.   </p>  <p>  The NMBI is working with its stakeholders, including HSE, to provide options for nurses who are required to obtain additional competencies in order to meet the requirements for registration.  Such options include the adaptation course and an aptitude test.</p></reply>

The applicant is only required to demonstrate to the HSE that they qualify under the EU Regulations and there is no requirement to submit income details and details of savings. </p>  <p>  The applicant must produce the appropriate E or S-form, completed by their Member State confirming the healthcare entitlement for which that state is liable.  The position regarding the UK is that, under a reciprocal agreement, the EU S form is not required, however, proof of receipt of a qualifying payment from the UK authorities should be provided with the application to the HSE.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has responsibility to establish if an applicant is subject to Irish social security legislation.  A person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation if s/he is in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment or engaged in work in Ireland and subject to PRSI.  If a person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation, the person will not qualify for a Medical Card under EU legislation or the reciprocal agreement, but may qualify for a means-tested medical card under national legislation.</p></reply>

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.

These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.  The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to further improve access times. </p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Foreign Ministers also had an informal exchange with the Colombian Government&rsquo;s High Commissioner for Peace, Dr Sergio Jaramillo.</p><p>The Council had a wide-ranging discussion on the ongoing migration crisis, including a detailed exchange on the agreement concluded with Turkey last month, as well as on developments along the main migration routes to Europe.  Foreign Ministers noted the successful operation to date of the EU naval operation EUNAVFOR MED Sophia, which has saved some 12,000 lives at sea (this is separate to the Irish naval mission which has rescued 8,592 migrants to date); EU support to Africa through the Emergency Trust Fund, and the launch of a series of comprehensive high level dialogues on migration with African countries and the Sahel.  Ministers also had a lunch meeting with UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi on the migration crisis in Europe, as well as broader global migration issues.</p><p><font color="#004080">  </font>The Council adopted Conclusions on Libya welcoming the arrival of the Presidency Council in Tripoli and commending &ldquo;the courage and determination of Prime Minister Serraj&rdquo;.  Ministers also had a video-conference discussion with Prime Minster Serraj.  The Council underlined &ldquo;Libyan ownership of the political process and the importance of its inclusiveness, notably through the continued participation of political and local actors, women and civil society&rdquo;.  Ministers agreed to offer security sector support to Libya should a request be made by the Government of National Accord.  Should such a request be forthcoming and subject to consultation with the Libyans they agreed that a possible civilian CSDP Mission could offer capacity building support in the fields of police and criminal justice including counter-terrorism, border management countering irregular migration and smuggling of migrants and trafficking of human beings.  They also agreed to give further consideration to providing support through EUNAVFOR MED Sophia by enhancing its capacity to disrupt the business model of human smugglers and trafficking networks through potential capacity building for the Libyan Coastguard and the implementation of international law.</p><p>The Council discussed the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership initiative and political developments in the six partner countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine) in preparation for the annual Eastern Partnership ministerial meeting which will take place in Brussels on 23 May 2016.  The Eastern Partnership is a vital framework for cooperation and dialogue with the EU&rsquo;s eastern partners.  In line with the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Eastern Partnership takes a tailored approach to EU cooperation with each partner in order to strengthen stability in the region as well as to encourage ongoing reforms.</p><p>We had a good discussion on recent developments in the peace process in Colombia with the Colombian Government&rsquo;s High Commissioner for Peace, Dr Sergio Jaramillo.  I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s steadfast support for the peace talks between the government and the FARC rebels.  These talks are now at a critical stage, and Ireland intends to contribute to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia which will be launched once a peace deal is signed.  I also expressed appreciation for the work of Mr. Eamon Gilmore who was present in his role as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process.  Mr. Gilmore is tasked with providing visibility for the diverse strands of the EU&rsquo;s efforts in the country and conveying the EU&rsquo;s political support for the peace process, bringing to bear his experience in peacebuilding and reconciliation on this island.</p><p>Foreign Ministers also briefly discussed the latest developments in the negotiations towards an Association Agreement between the EU and Mercosur.  Supported by a number of other Member States, I emphasised the need to proceed with caution in order to ensure a balanced agreement which takes account of the potential impact on the agricultural and other sectors.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and local authorities in addition to the Department's own school enrolment databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p><p>The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, I announced the establishment of 13 new schools to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>The school planning areas in Co. Wexford are experiencing demographic growth, however, not to such an extent that would currently warrant new school provision.  These areas are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to existing schools in each of the school planning areas.</p><p>There are 22 post-primary schools in the nine school planning areas in Co Wexford.  The majority of the school planning areas are projected to increase in enrolment numbers, although the total enrolment numbers are marginally less than projected based on the provisional 2015/16 enrolment data.  Overall, enrolments are projected to increase by circa 2,900 between the 22 schools, to peak in 2024/25, before beginning to reduce.  The intake patterns to the schools show that a significant proportion of students are not attending the post-primary school in their area but rather travelling out of the smaller school planning areas into the Wexford town and Enniscorthy areas to attend post-primary school.</p><p>In relation to the Wexford town school planning area, my Department analysed the pre-enrolment lists of students seeking places in First Year in September 2016 from the 12 post-primary schools in the Wexford town and four adjacent school planning areas of Enniscorthy, Adamstown, Kilmuckridge and Bridgetown.  This analysis showed that there was a large amount of duplication of applications with students applying to a number of schools in these areas and the intake patterns showed that a significant proportion of students who live outside the Wexford town school planning area have applied to attend schools in the Wexford town area.</p><p>Based on the provisional 2015/16 post-primary enrolment figures in the Wexford town schools, actual enrolments are broadly in line with the projected enrolments based on the demographic data.  In the five post-primary schools in the Wexford town school planning area, total enrolments are projected to grow over the next six year, peaking in 2021/22, after which enrolment numbers are projected to drop back to below current levels.  </p><p>Based on the provisional 2015/16 post-primary enrolments in Gorey, these are marginally higher than projected. There are two post-primary schools serving the Gorey school planning area.  Enrolments are expected to grow peaking in 2024-2025, after which enrolment numbers are expected to decrease.</p><p>As part of my Department's School Capital Investment Programme, a number of building projects in Wexford schools are being progressed, including Loreto Secondary School and Wexford C.B.S, which will provide for increased capacity in the area.  The increase in accommodation planned for the Wexford area should be adequate to cater for the projected increase in enrolments.</p></reply>

RAS is a social housing support targeted primarily at those already in receipt of Rent Supplement for over 18 months.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020 &ndash; Support, Supply and Reform</i>recognises that RAS continues to be a successful programme that has achieved considerable output levels to date and delivered quality housing to a large number of households.  Over the lifetime of the Strategy, an additional 6,000 households are targeted to transfer from Rent Supplement to RAS.</p><p>The long term vision for Rent Supplement is the transition of households with an established housing need to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP which is being introduced incrementally on a pilot basis to local authority areas enables local authorities to immediately provide housing assistance for households who qualify for social housing support, including many long-term Rent Supplement recipients. </p><p>Similar to the RAS, the HAP Scheme will facilitate the removal of a potential barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP commenced in September 2014 and some 8,500 households are currently being supported by the scheme.  HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas.  Until such time as HAP becomes operational in the remaining local authority areas, Rent Supplement will continue to be available to those households requiring support in meeting their housing needs in the rental market.</p><p>In terms of rent limits that apply in respect of Rent Supplement, I understand that the Department of Social Protection undertook a review of these limits in 2015 and found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply in the private rented market will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.  The Department of Social Protection has instead implemented a targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the Rent Supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rent supplement levels are increased above prescribed limits, where appropriate.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to other urban and commuter areas.  This flexible and targeted approach assists Rent Supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent supplement payments.</p><p>It is also worth noting that in the context of supply in the private rented market, the Equal Status Act 2000 has recently been amended to prohibit discrimination in the letting of residential property to people who are in receipt of Rent Supplement or Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Persons who feel they have been discriminated against by on the housing assistance ground, or any other protected ground, in relation to the provision of accommodation may wish to contact the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>In addition, in a new measure, landlords who rent to tenants in receipt of rent supplement or social housing supports may avail of increased tax relief with effect from 1 January 2016.  To qualify, landlords must undertake to make the accommodation available to qualifying tenants for a minimum of three years, and the undertaking must be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  Qualifying property owners can claim 100 per cent relief on their mortgage interest, as an expense against rental income.</p></reply>

All private vehicles registered prior to 2008 are taxed on the basis of engine capacity.  Private vehicles of EU class M1 only, registered from 2008 onwards, are taxed on the basis of carbon emissions.  A privately taxed vehicle taxed with an EU classification other than M1 e.g. N1 (typically a small jeep/van type vehicle), registered since 2008 must be taxed on the basis of engine capacity.</p>  <p>  Motor tax is based on both the construction and use of a vehicle.  Under section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is being used in a manner which would attract motor tax at a higher rate of duty, tax becomes payable at a higher rate.  In other words, if a vehicle constructed as a goods vehicle is being used in a private capacity, it must be taxed at the private rate of motor tax.</p>  <p>  Roadworthiness testing of vehicles is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I understand that vehicle testing is based solely on the construction of a vehicle.

This legislation is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  The local authority mortgage protection insurance (MPI) scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Committee which is a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) and is representative of the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and my Department.  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.  The current MPI premium is charged at 0.4703% of the outstanding capital loan balance as at 1 January each year.  A local authority housing loan applicant who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme must source a suitable individual MPI policy from the market.</p>  <p>  There are a number of differences between the local authority MPI scheme and standard MPI products available on the market.  Standard MPI products are individually priced based on a member's age, amongst other factors, whereas the Local Authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.</p>  <p>  Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors are the main influences on the price of the Local Authority MPI scheme:</p>  <p>  (i)  standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population actuarial statistics;</p>  <p>  (ii)  the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;</p>  <p>  (iii)  the terms and conditions of the Local Authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that all eligible local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; and</p>  <p>  (iv)  the claims experience of the Local Authority MPI scheme.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority MPI scheme also provides extra benefits, such as:</p>  <p>  -  mortgage repayments are paid if there is a valid claim as a result of disability;</p>  <p> -  separate to life cover, an additional &euro;3,000 is payable in the event of a member&rsquo;s death; and</p>  <p> -  members are covered for death up to age 75 whereas standard MPI cover usually ceases at the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided.  In negotiating a renewal of the scheme, which came into effect from 1 January 2012, the Committee were able to harness the downward pressure on pricing in the economy and secure an average 19% reduction on the rate which applied to the previous scheme.  As part of the upcoming re-tendering process, the Committee will seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017, the most appropriate Mortgage Protection Insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.  </p></reply>

I understand that this project is largely complete and 10 of the 18 units have tenants allocated to them.</p>  <p>  A second application has been submitted by the Council for the provision of an additional two units of accommodation on this site, along with a communal facility, by the same approved housing body.  A decision on funding for this second proposal will be made following the full completion of the first project, to include the submission of the final account, a post-project review and confirmation from Monaghan County Council that all units provided under the first project are fully tenanted.</p>  <p>  My Department has not been made aware that the tenanting of the remaining eight units under the largely complete project is contingent of the construction of a communal facility on the site and that was not part of the project application.  More broadly, the provision of communal facilities on a CAS-funded housing scheme is, in general, to improve the occupants&rsquo; living conditions and is not intended to be used as a care support facility.  Therefore, this should have little or no effect on the occupancy or tenanting of the units.  I would strongly encourage the tenanting of the remaining eight units as a matter of urgency, to ensure that persons who are in most need can avail of this newly developed facility.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. </p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services in the last four years, and is continuing to invest.  These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available. </p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment. </p><p>The formal procurement process commenced with the publication of the Pre-qualification Questionnaire and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March.  The responses are now being assessed in line with criteria set down by the Department with a view to selecting qualified provider(s) to proceed to the next stage of the procurement.  This second stage in the process will be a formal Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted  bidders.</p><p>The 2020 map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention.</p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators 78% of the townlands of Kilcannon, 88%of the townland of  Ballymurn Upper and 98% of the townland of Ballymurn Lower in Co Wexford will be covered by commercial operators.  The remaining 22% of the townland of Kilcannon, 12%of the townland of Ballymurn Upper and 2% of the townland of Ballymurn Lower will be part of the State intervention.  Members of the public can see whether their individual premise is in the BLUE or AMBER area by inserting their Eircode, and/or address, or scrolling through the map. </p><p>The intention is to build out the network in the AMBER area as quickly as possible.  The procurement process is underway and it is proposed to engage with the winning bidder(s) in due course on the optimum rollout strategy, and on the sequencing of the network deployment to maximise efficiencies during network build, having regard to business and consumer needs, and to areas of particularly poor service and areas of strong demand.  All these factors will need to be balanced against the most efficient network rollout and will be agreed during the procurement process. </p><p>Engagement with industry stakeholders as part of the pre-procurement consultations has indicated that the rollout in the Amber area could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.  In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of all premises in Ireland (both commercial and intervention area) will have access to high speed broadband within two years of the contract award, with 100% of premises connected within 5 years.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  As regards works on a private road there is a mechanism, subject to conditions, under the Discretionary Grant programme for local authorities to use some grant funding for such LIS works.  Any decision to do so rests with the local authority and no other funding is available for such works from this Department.</p></reply>

Instead local authorities may use up to 15% of their initial Discretionary Grant for LIS should they wish to do so. </p><p>As the Local Improvement Scheme is managed locally, it is a matter for the local authority to prioritise works according to resources.</p></reply>

Given this, a meeting with the National Chauffer Drivers Association is not considered necessary.  The Association may wish to raise its concerns in relation to the plans announced by Dublin City Council with the Council.</p></reply>
