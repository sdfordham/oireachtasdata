The Unions did not accept my  proposal but acknowledged that it was significant. After both teacher strikes, in December and last week,  I noted that their strike action was disproportionate and unnecessary. <br/><br/>The current dispute will not be resolved on the picket line. It will be resolved, I believe, through dialogue.<br/><br/>In fact, at our latest meeting, on Wednesday 14th January, it was agreed that dialogue was the best way forward, yet the 22 January strike went ahead anyway.<br/><br/>Dr Padraic Travers, who is facilitating the discussions between the Unions and the Department, has contacted both sides and has proposed further talks to commence later this week.<br/><br/>I welcome this opportunity for further dialogue. My Department will engage in these talks in a constructive manner.</p></reply>

The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.</p>  <p>  This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focussed pre-school inspections.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the DEIS programme has been the subject of ongoing evaluation by both the Educational Research Centre and my Department's Inspectorate to assess its impact.</p>  <p>  An overall report on the Learning from DEIS is also being prepared by the Economic and Social Research Institute which will draw together the main findings of research to date and provide advice to inform future policy to combat educational disadvantage, including DEIS. This report is currently being finalised and I expect to receive it in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

In that context, projects to provide permanent buildings for Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann and Midleton Educate Together National School were included in the five year school building programme. In December I announced that the projects for these schools are expected to proceed to construction this year.</p>  <p>  In line with the Memorandum of Understanding which formalises the local authorities' part in securing sites for educational use, my Department has worked with Cork County Council to identify suitable sites for these two schools. Sites have been identified and the conveyancing process is underway in both cases.  In tandem with completion of the conveyancing process, the projects are being progressed under the Department's Design and Build programme. A project manager has been appointed and plans for the schools are underway.</p></reply>

I believe that in a difficult time of reduced resources it was better to give schools flexibility in how best to use the available resources.</p>  <p>  I do not believe there is any problem in having a system that includes guidance within having an overall allocation.  That said, I am firmly of the belief that schools must use their allocations to support all of their students, including by offering appropriate guidance, counselling and pastoral care.</p>  <p>  I believe that the change that is needed is to improve the general allocation of staff to our schools. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.  I am determined that education will be prioritised for further investment in future years, and I believe that increasing the staffing and funding of our schools should be priorities for such investment.</p></reply>

I will arrange for the data to be sent to the Deputy directly.</p>  <p>  In relation to overall school provision in that area the position is that with the addition of both planned and recently delivered infrastructural provision in the north Kildare area, the existing schools between them are expected to be able to cater for the overall level of demand for places. This may result in pupils not obtaining a place of first choice.</p>  <p>  The Department is not in a position to duplicate provision in such areas in light of the demand on a nationwide basis to provide some 152,000 extra school places to ensure that every child in the country has access to a physical school place in the coming years. </p></reply>

There is currently a lease on the site for 9 years and 11 months at an annual cost of &euro;10,000, exclusive of VAT. It is due to expire in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The facility is the only recognised training centre in Ireland to test plant drivers for the equivalent UK certification, which means plant operators are certified as being competent both in Ireland and the UK to operate plant machinery.</p>  <p>  The centre has recently set up a certification unit which processes construction skills certificates for Dublin and Midland counties.  In excess of 2,000 learners were certified through this unit in 2014.</p>  <p>  A proposal to convert Mount Lucas from a training facility to a national assessment centre for construction plant and related health and safety courses is under consideration and consultation is underway with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Gaeltacht placement is a mandatory component of primary initial teacher education programmes and is governed by the Council's accreditation criteria, published in June 2011 (Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers) and which must be adhered to by all providers of primary initial teacher education providers.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the funding of the Gaeltacht Placement is a significant cost to students and their families.  However, there is special provision in place for students who experience hardship in meeting this cost. The decision to abolish the Gaeltacht Placement grants, from September 2012, has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible. Priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children.</p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the grant for the 4 week placement would be circa &euro;1m per annum.  I am not in a position to reinstate the funding to this area. </p></reply>

This involves validating need and consideration of possible solutions including, where appropriate, the PPP option.</p>  <p>  To ensure value for money with PPPs, 4 tests are required to be undertaken during the procurement process. The determination of the Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) is the most crucial of these.  The PSB provides a robust financial framework for the achievement of value for money.

However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would commence on a new salary scale which had a higher starting point than the old scale.</p>  <p>  As part of the Haddington Road Agreement, revised payscales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were implemented with effect from 1 July 2013.  The Agreement further provided that the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date would be addressed.  My Department therefore implemented a revised salary scale with effect from 1 November 2013 for teachers who entered between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.  Their maximum salary is now equal to that which applies for teachers who entered the profession prior to 2011.</p>  <p>  Allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels as part of this measure.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of POD will be to monitor the education progress of primary pupils (in DES aided schools), throughout the primary system and onwards to post primary level and to help them develop their full educational potential. Once up and running other secondary purposes of POD will include becoming the basis for the allocation of teachers and capitation grants. Aggregated POD data will also be used for the production and publication of primary level statistics.<br/><br/>  Individualised data coverage has already been in place for a number of years at pre-primary, post-primary and third level education who collect individual information on each pupil, including their PPSN.<br/><br/>  A PPS number is an individual's unique identification number for all dealings with the Public Service, including Social Welfare, tax, education and health services. Having the PPSN on the database will help ensure that there are no duplicate records in the system i.e that two schools do not have the same child on their roll. In the future we will be able to track pupils from early childhood education, to primary school and onto post-primary, which will allow us to ensure that every child in the State of compulsory school age is in education.<br/><br/>  POD application roles have been developed which limit school staff to viewing and maintaining their own pupil records. Access within the Department to POD data is limited to the POD team which is currently less than 15 people. No agency or other Government Department will have direct access to the Primary Online Database.<br/><br/>  The current retention policy for Primary Online Database (POD) data is for records to be maintained for the longer of either the period up to the pupil's 30th Birthday or for a period of ten years since the student was last enrolled in a primary school. In future schools will no longer be required to keep the Cl&aacute;rleabhar therefore POD will be the official register of pupils in schools and data will be retained to allow pupils to obtain their records in the future. The Department's retention policy is for audit and accounting purposes as pupil's data is used in the allocation of teaching posts and funding to schools. The policy also serves to trace retention trends in the education system, is important for longitudinal research and policy formation, as well as being an important statistical indicator nationally and internationally. Aggregate and not individual data is used for the majority of these purposes. This retention policy has been agreed with the Data Protection Commissioner and the Department is continually reviewing its retention policy for pupil data in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<br/><br/>  Figuring out which students don't make the transition from primary to post-primary is just one example of how this database could have enormous benefits for our citizens.</p></reply>

In the budget it was not possible to provide for extra teaching posts that would change the staffing schedule for primary schools, including small schools.The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and will continue to be so.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable. All public servants are being asked to do more with less and the teachers in our small schools cannot be exempt from this requirement.<br/><br/>  Since becoming Minister each of the education partners that I have met have indicated their own set of priorities.  In the school sector these priorities include school leadership, pay restoration, reductions in pupil-teacher ratios, increases to capitation, and the restoration of ex-quota guidance counsellors in schools.  Outside of the schools sector, the list of demands includes funding of third level, investment in early years and investment in technology. It is not, and never will be, possible to satisfy all of the demands of the education system at one time.  Hence the need to identify priorities for consideration as part of future budgets and as our economy recovers.</p></reply>

In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.<br/><br/>  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.<br/><br/>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department.<br/><br/>  The Child and Family Agency, is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Agency can be contacted at 01 6352854 or by E-mail at info@tusla.ie.<br/><br/>  My Department uses a Geographic Information System to identify the location and scale of additional school accommodation needed on a nationwide basis.  The outcome of demographic reviews carried out using this system are then fed into my Department's five year construction plan.  This plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to accommodate increasing pupil numbers.<br/><br/>  The Deputy will be aware that Government gave approval in March last year for drafting the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2014.  The bill is currently at an advanced stage of drafting and is on the Government legislative programme for publication early in the Spring/Summer session.<br/><br/>  The objective of the Admissions to School Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.  The framework also proposes a mechanism for ensuring that every child receives a school place.<br/><br/>  A key objective in designing the framework is to create greater confidence for parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools are legitimate, reasonable and fair.</p></reply>

These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.<br/><br/>  The procedures outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy.  In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture.  In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.<br/><br/>  The procedures also recognise the importance of good supervision and monitoring systems to prevent bullying and facilitate early intervention.  The school's anti-bullying policy must explicitly confirm that appropriate supervision and monitoring policies and practices are in place to both prevent and deal with bullying behaviour.<br/><br/>  In relation to reporting bullying behaviour, the procedures make clear that a pupil or parent may bring a bullying concern to any teacher in the school and individual teachers must take appropriate measures regarding reports of bullying behaviour in accordance with the school's anti-bullying policy.  The procedures require that all reports, including anonymous reports of bullying must be investigated and dealt with and that it should be made clear to all pupils that when they report incidents of bullying they are not considered to be telling tales but are behaving responsibly.<br/><br/>  The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils. There is a requirement in the procedures for the school Principal to report regularly to the Board of Management in relation to the overall number of bullying cases and provide confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.<br/><br/>  The Board is also required, under the procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school. Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.  There is no requirement for reporting incidents of bullying centrally to my Department.<br/><br/>  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.  Furthermore, the Inspectorate's plan for 2015 provides for collaborative research to be conducted in a sample of primary and post-primary on how schools provide for pupils' well-being.  This will culminate in a research report which will highlight best practice.</p></reply>

They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for the challenging times the country has faced in recent years. As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools was gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  An appeals process is available to schools that are affected by this measure.<br/><br/>  Educational quality for the pupils has to be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  It is also necessary to consider the needs of local communities and of course there are wider social and cultural factors that need to be considered.  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby.<br/><br/>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review.  The report of the value for money review of small primary schools will be published as soon as my Government colleagues and I have finalised our consideration of the report and its recommendations.<br/><br/>  The report contains much detailed and technical data in relation to the small schools in the primary sector and it also contains a suite of recommendations and options. Government needs time to properly consider the review report and its recommendations.  There are a range of important matters to be considered. Decisions on school provision and any possible reorganisation must be widely perceived to be cost-effective, equitable and reasonable.  These decisions need to be based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.</p></reply>

These payrolls have become increasingly complex over the past five years, due to the following:<br/><br/>- Introduction of three salary scales and two sets of allowances, by comparison to a single salary scale and set of allowances for all teachers, prior to 2010;<br/><br/>- Introduction of the Universal Social Charge (USC), Pension related Deduction (PRD) and the single pension scheme;<br/><br/>- Implementation of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 and new sick leave regulations for schools employees etc.<br/><br/>In addition, the school employee payrolls have a high volume of substitute and casual appointments for payment, which is not a feature of other comparable payrolls for Civil Servants, Army, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na etc.  Work is ongoing at present to incorporate payments to home tutors through the payroll, which will broaden the range of payees coming within the remit of the school employee payrolls.<br/><br/>  Accordingly, the development of the software to implement the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) in the context of the overall numbers being paid on the payroll (including substitute and casual appointees), the payroll complexities referenced above and the complexity of the agreement itself has been a very difficult and complex task.  A further complication is the fact that the software programme in addition to dealing with the deferred increments has to calculate/re calculate the salary reduction provisions of the HRA for those reaching &euro;65,000 taking account of the impact of increments and allowances.<br/><br/>  The development of the programmes together with the comprehensive testing necessary to ensure the correct application of the terms of the agreement has taken longer than projected to implement.<br/><br/>  The majority of increments for teachers earning less than &euro;65,000 including allowances became payable from the 1st December as teachers are generally appointed from 1 September.  For the majority of those earning in excess of &euro;65,000 increments will become payable from the 1st March. <br/><br/>The target dates for the payment of the deferred increments and arrears to primary teachers and special need assistants is the 12th February and to post primary teachers on the 19th February.</p></reply>

The school to which the Deputy refers is a 1,000 pupil post-primary school. Since the school commenced operation, the school authorities have enrolled children commensurate with the level of demand in the area.  However, the Department has been advised that the school must curtail enrolments from September 2015, as to continue with the previous enrolment levels would leave the school in an untenable position into the future with regard to its accommodation.<br/><br/>  However, the second new post primary school in the area which opened in September 2014 has advised my Department that they have the capacity to enrol additional children from 2015 onwards.  In that regard therefore, my Department is satisfied that there are sufficient school pupil places overall to meet the demand in the area in question.  This may sometimes, however, lead to pupils not being offered a place in their school of first preference.</p></reply>

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p>  <p>  This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  </p>  <p>  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.  The Equality legislation provides that any school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  However, it is important to be clear that it is a parent who decides the religious denomination of their child. It is not a decision of a school.  The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  Parents have the right, if so desired, to ensure that their children do not receive religious instruction. In accordance with Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student.</p>  <p>  It is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive. It is with this spirit of inclusiveness that the proposed Admission to Schools Bill is designed.  Drafting of the Bill is currently at an advanced stage and the Bill is on the Government legislative programme for publication early in the Spring/Summer session.</p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the draft Bill will provide for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.  The draft Bill will also provide for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  The Bill and its associated regulations should see improved access to schools for all pupils and ensure there is consistency, fairness and transparency in the admissions policies of schools and in the service they provide to parents.</p></reply>

Once in payment, the pension remains payable while the person remains widowed or a surviving civil partner, (i.e. it is withdrawn if they re-marry), and is increased to the level of the State pension contributory at age 66. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note there was no reduction in the last two budgets to the widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension.  The rate of payment for this pension has remained unchanged since January 2011, at &euro;193.50 for those under age 66 and &euro;230.30 for those aged 66 or over.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, with additional allowances payable in certain circumstances (e.g. dependent children).</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015 the Government increased the living alone allowance to &euro;9.00 for those who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments including the widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension.</p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible.  Maintaining the rate of the widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  The Government has no plans to change this policy.</p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons with a consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on FIS for 2014 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;281 million and it is currently paid to some 50,306 families in respect of almost 111,583 children. </p>  <p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  However, in the following two circumstances, the weekly rate of FIS can be revised during the year:</p>  <p>  - If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks;</p>  <p>  - If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit, then the FIS rate can be reassessed to take account of the loss of their one-parent family payment.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.  For those who experience a reduction in their income over the course of the year, the rate of payment will be reassessed at the end of the 52 weeks upon renewal of a FIS claim.    </p>  <p>  This aspect of the FIS scheme is also important in minimising the administrative effort associated with the operation of this scheme and helps to speed up processing times for claims for FIS, which could otherwise be subject to delays due to frequent reviews.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the existing arrangements.</p></reply>

As a result of that disability, which must be expected to last at least a year, they must be deemed to be substantially restricted in obtaining employment otherwise suitable to their age, qualifications and experience.  Applicants must also satisfy a means test and be habitually resident in the State.</p>  <p>  The onus is on the applicant to provide the Department with sufficient evidence to demonstrate their eligibility in relation to all conditionality.  Insufficient medical evidence is not recorded as a reason for disallowance on medical grounds and I regret to confirm that my Department is not in a position to provide you with the specific information you request.</p>  <p>  Although specific numbers are not available, the Department confirms that the quality and relevance of medical evidence supplied is a significant factor contributing to the number of applications which are disallowed in the first instance but allowed subsequently once additional evidence is supplied.  The Department is happy to review its decisions in the light of additional supporting evidence but this causes delays for customers.  It is in the interests of the customer, their doctor(s) and the Department that comprehensive evidence is furnished by the applicant in support of his/her application in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in its assessment of a person&rsquo;s medical suitability for DA, the Department does not dispute the diagnosis(es) of an applicant&rsquo;s doctor(s).  Rather, it considers the severity and expected duration of the condition(s) and the resultant care needs (where relevant) and assesses to what extent these match with the statutory conditionality of the DA scheme.</p></reply>

The rise in basic deprivation has affected all income groups and reflects the legacy of the economic crisis since 2008 on many low and middle income households. </p>  <p>  The key measure of poverty from a policy perspective is consistent poverty, which is the combination of at-risk-of-poverty and basic deprivation. The rate of consistent poverty in 2013 was 8.2 per cent, a slight though not statistically significant increase on 2012. The Government remains committed to meeting the national social target for poverty reduction, which is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and 2 per cent or less by 2020. </p>  <p>  A key component of Government policy to tackle poverty is to provide adequate income support through the social protection system. In 2013, welfare payments and other social transfers (including pensions) lifted a third of the population out of the at-risk-of poverty, thereby reducing the rate from 49.8 per cent to 15.2 per cent, which is 1 percentage point lower that the 2012 at-risk-of-poverty rate. </p>  <p>  Growing employment and providing the supports needed through activation to get people back to work will have a direct impact on poverty. While Government policies are restoring economic and employment growth, this recovery is not yet reflected in household living standards, as captured in the 2013 statistics. The Government is committed to delivering a new deal on living standards to ensure that the economic recovery is felt by low and middle income working families. Thus, Budget 2015 increases support for families raising children, assists unemployed families with children to return to work and improves the financial position of vulnerable welfare recipients, including those living alone. There were also significant reductions in personal income tax and the Universal Social Charge, and a major investment programme in social housing. I&rsquo;m confident that these measures will be reflected in future poverty statistics. </p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to the SICAP budget. He should note that responsibility for SICAP (Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme) lies with Minister for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Ireland's corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting Foreign Direct Investment ('FDI') to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.</p>  <p>  Further, it is clear that the certainty around the rate of Irish corporation tax is one of its biggest strengths, underlying the Government's commitment to the rate.  This certainty is important for business here, both domestic and international as companies plan investment decisions over the medium to long-term.</p>  <p>  With regard to international tax issues more generally, the ability of some multinationals to lower the amount of corporation tax they pay world-wide using international structures is an issue that has attracted a lot of public and media attention over the past 24 months. The G20 have acknowledged that this is a global challenge that requires global action, and this is happening through the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('BEPS') project.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaged in this process and it is anticipated that BEPS will result in changes being made to the international taxation rulebook which countries rely on for international trade.  Ireland has always played by these rules and played to win as is evidenced by our successful track record for attracting FDI.  </p>  <p>  This will not change in the post-BEPS environment, and I believe that the BEPS project will create opportunities for Ireland.  For example, one of the key concepts of BEPS is the better alignment of substance with taxing rights. The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has been the cornerstone of our CT policy since the 1950s so I believe that any change that may result from this process will lead to additional opportunities for Ireland. </p></reply>

An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.</p>  <p>   Hearings of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal are held on average twice a month at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire, which has the facilities to cater for people with mobility-impairing disabilities of the kind provided for under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme.</p>  <p>   I am informed by the Medical Board of Appeal that they do hold regional clinics as demand arises. Regional clinics were held at the Mercy University Hospital in Cork City in June 2012, August 2013 and October 2014. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that Regulation 6(1)(e) of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 353 of 1994) provides that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.</p></reply>

The heads also provide for a wide range of amendments to the legislation governing appeals in relation to the various taxes under the care of the Revenue Commissioners and consequential amendments to the various tax and duty Acts arising from the reform measures.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Agreed Protocol for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny by Oireachtas Committees, the heads of Bill were sent to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.

This consultation process highlighted an issue with a passive special purpose vehicle, SPV, which we had not intended to intend regulate, outsourcing servicing to a firm that would not be regulated. It became clear from the consultation process that credit servicing, as the customer-facing activity, was the appropriate activity to regulate and this legislation achieves this. Responses to the consultation process were published on my Department's website . <br/><br/>Once it had been decided to regulate credit servicing rather than ownership, consideration was given to the appropriateness of regulating ownership.While the owner may make decisions on a credit agreement, it is the credit servicer who will communicate these decisions to the borrower.After considerable and detailed examination, I now accept that the best way of ensuring the borrower is protected and retains access to the Financial Services Ombudsman is to regulate credit servicing and ensure borrowers can complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman about any actions affecting the borrower.  <br/><br/>The Bill has now been published and I look forward to Second Stage in the House next week. </p></reply>

Each of the local authorities has now submitted proposals on the areas which it believes should be included. Further discussions will be held in due course. <br/><br/>My officials have also been in contact with the EU Commission on the application for State aid approval for the Initiative.  A number of amendments were made to the Living City Initiative in Finance Act 2014 to ensure that the scheme was in accordance with EU State aid rules.  These include the imposition of a cap on the level of relief for the commercial element of the scheme.  This means the scheme now falls within the <i>de minimis</i>regulation.

Once the scheme is ready to commence I will make an announcement, in conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues and the local authorities concerned.<br/><br/>It is important to note that I do not see this as a wide-spread initiative, as it is targeted at those areas which are most in need of attention.</p></reply>

Part 2 of the LPT Act outlines the LPT exemptions that are available.  A broad outline of exempt properties includes:<br/><br/>- New and previously unused properties that are purchased from a builder or developer between 1 January 2013 and 31 October 2016; <br/><br/>- Properties purchased between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013, if occupied as the sole or main residence of the purchaser; <br/><br/>- Residential properties constructed by a builder or developer that remain unsold and have not been used as dwellings; <br/><br/>- Properties in unfinished housing estates as prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government; <br/><br/>- Properties certified as having significant pyritic damage;<br/><br/>- Registered nursing homes; <br/><br/>- Unoccupied properties which had been the sole or main residence of a person who has vacated the property because of long term mental or physical infirmity; <br/><br/>- Properties occupied by permanently and totally incapacitated individuals as their sole or main residence;<br/><br/>- Residential properties owned by a charity or public body and used to provide &quot;special needs accommodation&quot;; <br/><br/>- Properties used by a charity in connection with recreational activities; <br/><br/>- Properties fully subject to commercial rates; <br/><br/>- Diplomatic properties exempt under other legislation.<br/><br/>I am advised by the Commissioners that details of these exemptions were also provided on page 10 of the Guide to LPT, which was issued to all property owners in March/April 2013. The Deputy may also find the following () from the Revenue website helpful as it provides additional details of the various exemptions from the tax. <br/><br/>As regards liability for payment of the tax, the Commissioners have also confirmed that where a property has not reached the stage of construction where it is suitable for use as a dwelling until after 1 May 2013, it is outside the scope of LPT for the first valuation period of 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2016.  Accordingly, the owner would not be liable to pay LPT on the property until 2017.  I am further advised that a property that was not liable to LPT on 1 May 2013 on the basis that it was uninhabitable will not be liable to LPT for the years 2013 to 2016.  If such a property were to be refurbished to make it suitable for use as a dwelling by 1 November 2016 then it will be liable to LPT for 2017 and subsequent years.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <br/><br/>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; -  below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<br/><br/>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<br/><br/><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000 - </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br/><br/><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 - </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br/><br/><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 - </b>applies in all other cases.<br/><br/>In the case of the Group A tax-free threshold, each child is separately entitled to receive life-time gifts or inheritances up to the total value of &euro;225,000 from his or her parents before that child would have any liability to CAT.  Gifts or inheritances received by the child since 5 December 1991 from his or her parents are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether this threshold is exceeded.  CAT is charged on the amount of the gift or inheritance that exceeds the child's tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 at the rate of 33% and on that excess only.<br/><br/>Land, either as a site or as a farm, is an asset for both gift and inheritance tax purposes and the transfer of such capital assets by parents to children, either during the lifetime of the parents, or on the death of the parents, is within the scope of CAT. The transfer of such capital assets has always been subject to CAT and the Finance Act 2014 changes in restricting the CAT exemption for normal and reasonable payments made by parents to children for their support, maintenance or education has not changed this position.<br/><br/>It should be noted that since the introduction of CAT in 1975 special treatment has been afforded to gifts or inheritances of agricultural propertyhowever, this does not apply to gifts of sites for house building. Agricultural Relief is available provided the conditions applicable to the relief are fulfilled.  The effect of the relief is that market value of agricultural property gifted or inherited is reduced significantly for the purposes of determining the amount of CAT, if any, payable on a gift or inheritance of such property.Currently, the market value of agricultural property is reduced by 90%.  <br/><br/>This means that, where agricultural relief applies, parents can normally transfer agricultural property up to the value of &euro;2,250,000 to each of their children, provided the children satisfy the conditions applicable to the relief, without any liability to CAT arising on the transfer. If the agricultural property is worth &euro;2,250,000 and agricultural relief applies, the taxable value of the agricultural property is reduced by 90% from &euro;2,250,000 to &euro;225,000 for CAT purposes.

PRSAs may be taken out by anyone, regardless of employment status, are transferable from job to job and are available from a variety of authorized providers.  However, they have particular relevance for those who are not members of occupational pension schemes and the self-employed (where they operate as an alternative to retirement annuity contracts).  In essence, a PRSA is a personally held contract-based defined contribution retirement arrangement between an individual and an authorised PRSA provider, such as an insurance company, credit institution or investment firm.  They are maintained in the form of an account that holds units in investment funds managed by the authorized providers.</p>  <p>  An individual may make tax-relieved contributions to a PRSA and, where the PRSA is effected by an employer in circumstances where there is no employer-sponsored occupational pension scheme, employers may also contribute but are not obliged to do so.  Pension benefits under a PRSA may, with some exceptions, be taken from age 60 to age 75.  A tax-free retirement lump sum not exceeding 25% of the fund can be taken, subject to a maximum tax-free amount of &euro;200,000 with the remainder of the fund used to purchase an annuity, retained in the PRSA and drawn-down over time or used to avail of the flexible retirement options which include investing in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF).  All withdrawals are subject to income tax at the individual's marginal income tax rate as appropriate.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why, under existing policy, pre-retirement access to pension savings held in the form of pension plans or schemes is not permitted.  The principal reason is that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long-term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be "locked away" to help fund an adequate income in retirement.  This is why the Government encourages pension savings through generous tax relief on contributions and pension fund growth.</p>  <p>  That said, in Budget and Finance Act 2013, I introduced Section 782A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide members of occupational pension schemes with a once-off opportunity to access a part of their Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs), including AVCs made by a scheme member to an AVC-PRSA product, prior to retirement.  The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.  The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant and most individuals have decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.  I would emphasise, of course, that the pre-retirement access allowed for in this initiative is to additional pension savings over and above an individual's core savings in his or her main employer-sponsored scheme.  Main pension scheme savings are generally not accessible pre-retirement.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that for those in financial difficulties, it is natural to look to their pension savings as a possible means of helping to solve those difficulties.  However, I am strongly of the view that it is preferable not to allow early unplanned withdrawals of core pension savings as an inevitable result is to divert the savings, initially intended to finance retirement, to meet short term financial crises.  Allowing such access would clearly pose retirement income adequacy issues and the impact of the early withdrawal of pension savings on the ultimate value of the pension pot at retirement should not be underestimated.</p>  <p>  For these various reasons, I have no plans to extend pre-retirement access to pension savings beyond what is provided for in relation to AVCs.</p></reply>

The CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.<br/><br/>Under the CCMA, a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of a borrower's primary residence, where:<br/><br/>a) the lender has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative; and<br/><br/>b) (i) for co-operating borrowers, eight months from the date the arrears arose, or three months from the date of the letter informing the borrower that an alternative repayment arrangement is not deemed to be appropriate; or<br/><br/>(ii) where the borrower has been classified as not co-operating and the lender has issued the notification required under the CCMA.<br/><br/>While the repossession of a principal dwelling house consequent upon mortgage default should only be considered as a last option for a person in genuine difficulty, repossessions do arise and this can be expected to continue as long as the mortgage crisis remains.  It should be noted, however, that when repossessions do arise most are of a voluntary nature and that the legal repossession route only arises in a minority of cases.<br/><br/>It is important to point out, however, that even if a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.  In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.<br/><br/>The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.</p></reply>

Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States.</p>  <p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst the Member States, including some of the participating countries.  These concerns have led to the issuing of a communique by the participating Member States, announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives.  However, significant technical and legal discussions will continue to be required at the Council Working Party before the text of the proposed Directive can be finalised.  With this in mind, the targeted implementation date for the FTT has been rescheduled to 1 January 2016.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the provisional yield from this charge in 12014 was &euro;283.67m.</p>  <p>  Ireland was one of the first Member States to introduce a Carbon Tax on fossil fuels which as well as providing for much needed revenues also went some way towards addressing environmental concerns.  The tax was introduced, at an initial rate of &euro;15 per tonne of C02 emission, on a phased basis in Budget 2010 and applied to petrol and diesel from budget night 2009 and to all other fossil fuels (except solid fuels) from 1st May 2010.  The rate was increased to &euro;20 per tonne of CO2 emission in Budget 2012.  It was extended to solid fuels from May 2013 at a rate of &euro;10 per tonne which increased to &euro;20 per tonne in May 2014.  The provisional carbon tax receipts for 2014 are &euro;385.2m.</p>  <p>  An Air Travel Tax with a general rate of &euro;10, and &euro;2 for shorter journeys, was introduced in the 2009 Budget, effective from 30 March 2009.  The Finance Act 2011 provided for a single rate of Air Travel Tax of &euro;3 for all passengers with effect from 1 March 2011, replacing the &euro;2 and &euro;10 distance related rates.  Following the success of the 'The Gathering' in 2013, Budget 2014 provided for the removal of the Air Travel Tax from 1st April 2014.  This was to encourage the development of new routes, increasing capacity and traffic flows which in turn would boost tourism and lead to the creation of jobs.

Given the scale of the State's investment - some &euro;20.8 billion - and the range of options available to recoup value from the bank, officials within my department are working with AIB on reconfiguring its capital structure.  Goldman Sachs International has been appointed to provide financial advice to the Department  in this regard. </p>  <p>  The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time.  While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.  All options remain on the table and it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or to put a timeline on decisions.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated on numerous occasions, Government policy is that we will not remain a holder of our banking investments in the long term.  Given our high debt to GDP ratio, we do not have the luxury of holding all of these investments indefinitely and I envisage receipts from the gradual sale of these investments helping to play their part in reducing the State's overall debt burden in the coming years. </p></reply>

This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT and was introduced on 7 December 2005 and amended since (most recently in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 which, among other things, reduced the SFT from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million from 1 January 2014).   </p>  <p>  A higher limit, known as a Personal Fund Threshold or PFT, may be claimed where the capital value of an individual's pension benefits exceeded the SFT on the date of its introduction or on the dates of its reduction.   </p>  <p>  The SFT regime was originally introduced mainly to deal with the abuse of the tax-relief arrangements for pensions which resulted in pension overfunding by individuals and was also subsequently amended to place a constraint on the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief for pension saving generally.  The regime deals with these issues at the point of pension draw down in retirement rather than by applying specific restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront.  There is, therefore, no restriction or limit on the contributions that an individual can make to his or her pension savings on an ongoing basis or on the annual accrual of pension benefits (other than the standard earnings and age-related percentage limits that determine the annual level of tax-relieved contributions that can be made by an individual).  Instead, a significant tax charge is imposed on the value of retirement benefits in excess of the SFT or PFT, as appropriate, when they are drawn down.  In this way, the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of funding for benefits above those limits by clawing back, through the tax charge, the tax relief granted.   </p>  <p>  Where an individual is a member of a pension scheme or arrangement on or after 7 December 2005 and the scheme or arrangement is or becomes subject to a pension adjustment order (PAO), then in calculating the capital value of any benefit drawn down at retirement from the pension scheme or arrangement (e.g. a pension, annuity, lump sum etc.) in respect of that individual for the purpose of establishing if their SFT or PFT has been exceeded, the benefits designated to a spouse or civil partner under the PAO are to be included in the calculation as if the PAO had not been made.  Also, in calculating whether an entitlement to a PFT arises in the first place, the individual seeking the PFT includes the capital value of his/her pension benefits as if the PAO had not been made.    </p>  <p>  The PAO exclusion provision was introduced as an anti-avoidance  measure, designed to prevent an individual with a PFT, whose pension was subject to a PAO, from taking the view that as part of his or her pension had been assigned to a spouse/civil partner, he or she was then free to avail of further tax relief in building their part of the pension fund back up to the level of their PFT.  If this had been permitted, it would have allowed a situation to arise whereby the aggregate amount of the pension funds built up originally with tax relief (in respect of which the PFT was granted) and then built back up again (with further tax relief) to the PFT amount, following the PAO, to greatly exceed the original amount of the PFT, at significant additional tax cost to the Exchequer.  For these reasons, the legislation requires a PAO to be ignored for the purposes of determining whether an individual's SFT or PFT has been exceeded.  The corollary of this is that the designated benefit going to the non-member spouse or partner is not included in determining the overall capital value of the non-member spouse or partner s supplementary pension benefits, if any, as to do so could result in  double taxation.     </p>  <p>  Up to recently, the arrangements described above could also result (where a chargeable excess arose and a PAO was involved)  in the pension scheme member being liable to the entire tax charge on the excess, notwithstanding that a significant part of his or her pension benefits may have been designated to a former spouse or partner.  In section 19 of Finance Act 2014, on foot of representations made to me in this matter, I made provision so that, in such cases, the tax charge is shared more equitably between the affected individual and his or her former spouse or partner in relation to whom the PAO refers.   </p>  <p>  It has never been the case that the SFT, or a PFT if applicable, is shared between individuals whether married or divorced.  The SFT has relevance and potential application only to individuals who are funding for or accruing pension benefits in pension saving arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners and who have relevant earnings out of which contributions to such arrangements are, or are capable of, being tax-relieved or tax subsidised.  It has no direct application or relevance to individuals or taxpayers who are not in this position, including for example, the former spouses or partners of pension scheme members who are not in pension saving arrangements as described.  I have no plans for further change in these arrangements. </p></reply>

The assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process.  Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.  Therefore there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements must logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs.  In this regard, my Department has issued guidance (Circular 10/14) to public bodies aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.  The Office of Government Procurement through its category councils and through its engagement with public bodies is ensuring that this message is being brought to the attention of buyers across the public service. </p></reply>

It continues to provide very important revenue to the State, and as such remains a key constituent of the suite of financial emergency measures affecting public service pay and pensions which have been adopted in response to the financial crisis. </p>  <p>  For information, I would point out that in relation to public service pension arrangements a succession of cost containment measures have been put in place over recent years affecting existing pensioners, serving staff and new recruits in the public service.</p>  <p>  The most significant cost-saving reform has been the introduction in January 2013 of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, also known as the Single Scheme, which is the default pension scheme for new-hire workers across the entire public service.  This landmark reform targets very substantial long-run savings of about one third of pension outgoing, with those savings deriving mainly from career-average (not final-salary) pension accrual, inflation (not pay) linkage of benefits, and higher minimum pension age (effectively 68 years for most new joiners).</p>  <p>  Several other measures have also been taken over recent years which help to curb public service pension costs as follows:</p>  <p>- In 2004 minimum pension age for new-joiner public service workers was raised from 60 to 65 years.</p>  <p>- In 2010 public service pay cuts averaging approximately 7% were applied.  Further pay cuts affecting public servants with annual earnings above &euro;65,000 were applied in July 2013.  In general, these various pay reductions act to reduce individual pension and lump sum awards to persons retiring from the public service.</p>  <p>- In January 2011 public service pensions in payment above &euro;12,000 were reduced via a multi-band progressively structured Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which had an average impact of 4% on pensions.</p>  <p>- In July 2013, further cuts in public service pension payment rates, via adjustments to the rates and scope of the PSPR, and amounting to between 2% and 5%, were imposed on pensions in excess of &euro;32,500.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the great majority of public servants hired since 1995 make an explicit contribution to their pensions, comprised of 3% of pay and an additional 3.5% of net pay, where net pay is defined as salary less twice the rate of Contributory State Pension.</p>  <p>  With regard to the future of PRD, I have already put on record my view that, subject to a continuation of our fiscal recovery and to the necessary economic conditions being in place, I envisage a future orderly wind-down of the financial emergency measures legislation.  In planning for the eventual ending of the financial emergency and for addressing the related legislative position, the Government will be concerned to ensure that a return to more normal pay setting arrangements in the public service is accompanied by pension arrangements which are clearly seen to be sustainable in the long term.</p></reply>

This scheme has a new minimum pension age of 66, raised from 65 as applies to new entrant Public Servants from 2004, and linked to future increases in the age for the Contributory State Pension. Benefits under the new scheme are substantially revised, with pensions for all new entrant Public Servants, including new entrant Oireachtas Members and Officeholders, to be based on career average earnings rather than the current final salary basis.</p>  <p>  Successive Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts have impacted on the pay and pensions of politicians.  For example the pay reductions have substantially reduced the salaries on which pensions are calculated.  A progressive Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) was introduced from January 2011 on the pensions of those who retired before March 2012, and a new higher PSPR rate of 20% was introduced from January 2012 for pensions over &euro;100,000.  Further PSPR reductions were introduced for pensions of &euro;32,500 and above from July 2013 which impacts on those retiring before the end of the current 'grace period'.  This was deemed necessary and appropriate to ensure that higher-paid pensioners, including Oireachtas Members and Officeholders, would make a fair and proportionate additional contribution to the fiscal consolidation measures. </p>  <p>  A further effective pension cut applies with effect from 1 September 2013 in the case of persons who receive two or more Public Service pensions which have a combined value in excess of &euro;32,500.  This further pension cut is based on applying the PSPR to the combined value of the multiple Public Service pensions held by such a person, rather than to each pension individually.  This aggregation of pensions for PSPR purposes reduces the overall Public Service pension income of affected pensioners, including significant numbers of pensioners who receive both a TD pension and a Ministerial pension.</p>  <p>  Other measures introduced in recent years which have impacted on the pensions of politicians include the exclusion for pension purposes of long service increments and the bar on serving Oireachtas or European Parliament Members from receiving Ministerial pensions.  In addition, although not a pension issue, severance payments for Ministers and other Officeholders were abolished under the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014 and no member of the current Government will receive such payments upon leaving Office.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to further reduce Public Service pensions.  However, I would like to assure the Deputy that pay and pension costs will be kept under review as part of the Government's ongoing strategy to bring the public finances to a sustainable level.</p></reply>

Tipperary.  As the Deputy will see from the following tabular statement, which sets out on a county-by-county basis the number of IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits during 2014, one county had the same number of visits as Tipperary while 11 counties had a lesser number of visits and 13 counties received more visits.  Dublin received the most visits.  In this connection, I must point out that, while IDA Ireland does try to influence the location, the final decision on where to visit is made by the investor.  IDA Ireland is currently in the process of finalising its new strategy for the coming 5 years and is conscious of the need to secure investments and jobs for all regions of the country over the lifetime of the strategy.  <br/><br/>Growing both Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and indigenous enterprise is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.

As the Directive is a maximum harmonisation instrument, it is not open to Member States to alter the rules on the commencement and expiry of the cooling-off period.  The Regulations and the Directive provide, however, that consumers may cancel a service contract where the service has commenced but has not been fully performed provided that they pay the trader an amount proportionate to the service provided up to the time of cancellation.  Under previous EU and Irish law, consumers could not cancel a distance or off-premises contract whose performance had already commenced.

Similarly, in the case of Enterprise Ireland there were 58 investment announcements in the same 4 year period with the potential to create almost 14,000 jobs.  In the same four year period there were 59,763 jobs (both full and part time) created in IDA Ireland client companies and 56,865 jobs (both full and part time) created in Enterprise Ireland client companies.<br/><br/>It is important to note that in any given year the numbers of jobs created always exceed the number of jobs announced.<br/><br/>In a great many cases a new investment project progresses without any public announcement.  It is a matter for the individual company whether or not to announce an investment project publicly.  While some jobs come on stream immediately following an announcement it can take up to 3 to 5 years for jobs to come on stream in other cases.  This time lag is necessary to enable premises to be acquired or constructed and for staff to be recruited. <br/><br/>The following tabular statement sets out the number of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland jobs announcements, potential job creation figures and actual job creation figures for each of the years 2011 to 2014, inclusive. <div><b>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland announcements in each of the years 2011 to 2014, inclusive, together with figures for potential job creation along with actual job creation figures</b></div><table><tr><th><div>Year </div></th><th><div>Number of Investment announcements </div></th><th><div>Number of potential  jobs associated with those announcements </div></th><th><div>Actual number of jobs created <br /><br />(both full time and other)</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>79</div></td><td><div>5,875</div></td><td><div>14,432</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>84</div></td><td><div>8,287</div></td><td><div>15,215</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>69</div></td><td><div>5,408</div></td><td><div>15,104</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>66</div></td><td><div>6,508</div></td><td><div>15,012</div></td></tr></table><div><b>Table showing the number of Enterprise Ireland announcements in each of the years 2011 to 2014, inclusive, together with figures for potential job creation along with actual job creation figures.</b></div><table><tr><th><div>Year </div></th><th><div>Number of <br /><br />Investment announcements </div></th><th><div>Number of potential  jobs associated with those announcements</div></th><th><div>Actual number of jobs created<br /><br />(both full time and other) </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>2,638</div></td><td><div>13,191</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>3,891</div></td><td><div>12,224</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>4,103</div></td><td><div>15,315</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>3,364</div></td><td><div>16,135</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-27a.345.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012700068#WRH01300"><p>Firstly I would like to point out that The Department of Justice and Equality retains legal and policy primacy with regard to immigration and residency whereas this Department&rsquo;s function concerns employment access to the labour market.<br/><br/>My Department&rsquo;s preference is that the industry needs are met without recourse to the employment permit regime.  In framing policy regarding employment permits, thought is given to wider policy instruments that are also available in meeting the challenges presented by skills shortages.  Migration in itself is not a sustainable long-term overall solution to skills shortages.  It is intended to complement the primary policy objective of Government, the up-skilling of the resident population at all levels.  We are cognisant that migration can, in some circumstances, help to perpetuate skills shortages in the economy, by reducing latent demand for such skills.  Ensuring an uninterrupted flow from the domestic and EEA economies of high quality specialist skills in de-boning is critical.  The Department of Education and Skills will comment on opportunities for training operatives in the meat industry including butchers/boners.<br/><br/>My Department reviews and updates the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and Ineligible Categories of Employment List for employment permits bi-annually.  This review is predicated on a formalised and evidence based process.  Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU-SOLAS) with the EGFSN&rsquo;s National Skills Bulletin contributing principally to the Department&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the labour market.  The 2014 National Skills Bulletin had just over 8,000 butchers and fishmongers of which almost 40% are non-EEA nationals.  Few occupations have a share of non-EEA nationals higher than butchers.  The number of non-EU national visas that have been issued to the meat industry for each of the past ten years are listed in the following table.  The SLMRU&rsquo;s analysis of labour market transitions in 2013 indicated a high turnover for food operatives and suggests an issue regarding retention of staff.  The National Skills Bulletin concluded that while no shortages of meat processing skills had been identified, it recognised that many food processing companies are experiencing difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled butchers/de-boners. <br/><br/>My Department has had ongoing engagement with the meat industry since 2013 to resolve the issue of a sufficient supply of de-boners.  In May 2013 my Department convened an inter-Departmental group Chaired by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and comprising, Department of Social Protection (DSP) and Department of Education and Skills (DES) and Enterprise&ndash;Ireland, to see how the issue might be addressed.  Arising from this Interdepartmental Group DSP held two recruitment events in 2014 and also assisted the meat companies, though its EURES service, to identify skilled persons in the EEA countries.  The DSP continues to be available to the industry to advise on its recruitment needs. <br/><br/>In June 2014 my Department again met with the meat industry in advance of their preparing a comprehensive submission, requested by the Interdepartmental Group, regarding the difficulty they are still experiencing in attracting and retaining skilled de-boners.  My Department is awaiting the final submission from Meat Industry Ireland (MII) following discussions with MII on their draft submission.<div><b>Number of Non-EU national visas that have issued to the meat industry for each of the past ten years</b></div><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>New</th><th>Renewal</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>31</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>23</div></td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>108</div></td><td><div>138</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>31</div></td><td><div>75</div></td><td><div>106</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>33</div></td><td><div>238</div></td><td><div>271</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>93</div></td><td><div>127</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>224</div></td><td><div>98</div></td><td><div>322</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>109</div></td><td><div>322</div></td><td><div>431</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2006</div></td><td><div>107</div></td><td><div>751</div></td><td><div>858</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2005</div></td><td><div>154</div></td><td><div>989</div></td><td><div>1143</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery.  That is why the Government is placing an increased emphasis on supporting job creation at regional level. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs contained a number of measures to support competitive regions, including the development of a framework for Regional Enterprise Strategies and the commencement of building works by the IDA on advanced manufacturing facilities and office space in a number of regional locations.  We will intensify our focus on the regions in 2015 and, as I have announced previously, we will develop Enterprise Strategies for each region.  In a manner similar to the Action Plan for Jobs, the Regional Enterprise Strategies will identify measures that can be taken to enable each region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs, building on its existing competitive strengths and opportunities.</p>  <p>  The first Regional Enterprise Strategy to be published will cover the Midlands region, which includes the counties of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly.  Over the past number of months, officials from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and my Department have been involved in a series of engagements with the main stakeholder groups in the Midlands to discuss the strengths and opportunities that can be built upon to support enterprise and jobs growth in that region.   </p>  <p>  All proposals received through these stakeholder engagements are being examined by my officials who are currently finalising the preparation of the Regional Enterprise Strategy for the Midlands.  The process is concentrated on identifying practical actions that can be taken in the short-to-medium term, and broadly within existing resources, to improve the operating environment for businesses.  </p>  <p>  In the last number of weeks, the Government stated its ambition to achieve full employment by 2018.  Achieving this objective will be supported by each region realising its economic potential.</p></reply>

The evaluation of tenders received took place recently and the successful contractor will be appointed shortly.  It is expected that the study will commence in February and conclude in early Q3 of 2015.

The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.<br/><br/>The companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment in every county and region across Ireland.<br/><br/>In 2014, EI assisted companies generated 19,705 new jobs.  This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the total number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of the Agency.<br/><br/>At the end of 2014, total direct employment (full and part time) in Enterprise Ireland client companies stood at 180,072 in 2014.  Of these, 156,202 are full-time jobs, while 23,870 are part-time.  These full-time employment and total employment levels are the highest recorded in the history of the agency.<br/><br/>This continuation of employment growth demonstrates clearly the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland.

On the basis of information received from the lead Departments involved, the assessment of the CEDRA IDG is that 4 recommendations have been delivered, substantial and on-going action is being taken on a further 6; action has commenced and is progressing well on a further 16 while action on the remaining 15 recommendations is either at the commencement stage or awaiting updated information to enable an accurate evaluation be made.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the CEDRA report will shortly fall within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.</p>  <p>  Rules regarding the advance notification of inspections are clearly laid down in the governing EU regulations and must be adhered to by officials in my Department. The regulations allow my Department to give notice for land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving SMRs other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare. However this notice must be strictly limited to the minimum time period necessary and shall not exceed 14 days. For checks involving cattle and sheep identification and registration the maximum advance notice is 48 hours. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given and these inspections must take place on an unannounced basis. Where it is considered that the purpose or effectiveness of any type of inspection may be jeopardised by giving notice, the inspection will take place on an unannounced basis. In determining the type of notice to be given for an inspection a number of factors are considered so as to ensure that the inspection process is not jeopardised.</p>  <p>  There is a comprehensive appeal system in place for applicants to avail of if they consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements or if they are unhappy with the inspection findings. This appeal system incorporates an initial review by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer, with the option to appeal the outcome of any such review to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office. In the event that an applicant is not satisfied with the outcome of this review he/she has the right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman. The Department has established a Farm Advisory System under the Direct Payment Schemes to give advice to applicants and it is recommended any applicant with any inspection concerns whatsoever avail of this service, which involves Teagasc and private agricultural consultants, to allay any such concerns.</p></reply>

In addition Bord na gCon has specific statutory powers conferred on it in the <i>Greyhound Industry (Racing) Regulations 2007</i>, which relate to the conduct of greyhound racing.<br/><br/>Bord na gCon has confirmed to officials in my Department that its drug surveillance services test for the presence of stanozolol and that there have been no confirmed cases of stanozolol reported for Bord na gCon samples to date.<br/><br/>In July 2014 my Department published the findings from a study, commissioned by my Department and conducted by Indecon into <i>&ldquo;Certain matters relating to Bord na gCon&rdquo;</i>. Indecon in accordance with its Terms of Reference considered the area of regulation and made a number of recommendations in this regard. The response of Bord na gCon to the Indecon report, which sets out a programme of action and a timeline for delivery, can be found on the Bord na gCon website.<br/><br/>Bord na gCon has recently completed a public consultation on proposed regulatory reform and intends to conduct further public consultations on this topic in the future. It has also launched a Review into Anti-Doping and Medication Control which is being led by Professor Tim Morris, with a view to strengthening the regulatory systems within the industry.<br/><br/>In parallel, officials from my Department have already commenced the process of identifying the legislative changes that are required to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Indecon report.<br/><br/>It is my firm belief that the future of the greyhound industry is dependent on the stakeholders having trust and confidence in the industry, and this is contingent on the industry having the highest standards of integrity founded on strong regulatory systems. The Board and the Executive of Bord na gCon have assured me that they share my view and are doing their utmost to enhance the regulatory systems underpinning the industry to ensure that they are effective and fit-for-purpose.<br/><br/>I expect that Bord na gCon, who as I outlined at the outset is the state body responsible for the regulation of greyhound racing, will be happy to provide additional detail sought by the Deputy on this topic.</p></reply>

The term of office of an ordinary member of the Board of Bord na gCon is 3 years. Notwithstanding the expiry of a term of office Board members continue to hold office until such time as the Minister appoints a person to replace the out-going member. <br/><br/>The terms of office of Mr Mattie Murphy, Ms R&iacute;ona Heffernan, Mr Timothy Gilbert and Mr Tony McNamee were due to expire on 1 December 2014, however they remain in situ until they are replaced as provided for in legislation. In addition Mr William O&rsquo;Dwyer is set to complete his term of office 20 June 2015. Out-going Board members are eligible for re-appointment.<br/><br/>Since 2011, when the Government introduced new arrangements for appointments to State Boards, expressions of interest have been invited for vacancies arising on Bord na gCon through this Department&rsquo;s website. On 30 September 2014 the Government announced further changes to this system including that all appointments should be advertised on (operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS)), setting out specific and detailed criteria for the relevant role. The process of drafting the role specification for a Board position involves consultation between the Chairman of the State Board, the relevant Ministers and PAS, with the Minister having the final sign-off. All appointments will, under these arrangements, be processed by way of a transparent system in order to support the relevant Minister in making appointments to State Boards. The details of the new arrangements are to be found in the &ldquo;Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards&rdquo; on <br/><br/>I can confirm to the Deputy that the upcoming Board vacancies in Bord na gCon will be filled in accordance with the Guidelines and have been advertised on the website of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Chairman of Bord na gCon is currently considering role specification criteria for incoming members of Bord na gCon and I expect to hear from him shortly in this regard after which I will be in a position to liaise with PAS with a view to finalising the role specification and forwarding it for publication on . Interested applicants will be invited to apply and the appointments process will then progress to finality, in accordance with the Guidelines. The Deputy will understand that it is not possible to put a timeline on when the process will be completed.</p></reply>

My Department currently supports the conservation and preservation of our national rare equine breeds, including the Connemara pony through agri-environmental schemes - the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS), and under the proposed new Green Low carbon Agri-environmental Scheme (GLAS). GLAS is a scheme under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, which my Department submitted last July to the European Commission for approval.<br/><br/>The Connemara pony breed is renowned for its hardiness, docility and versatility. Individual ponies within the breed have also excelled at top levels in the FEI disciplines of showjumping, eventing and dressage.<br/><br/>I am very conscious of the contribution of the Connemara pony breed to the sport horse industry which, according to a 2012 report commissioned by Horse Sport Ireland, contributes in excess of &euro;708 million per annum to the Irish economy and provides 12,512 full‐time job equivalents.<br/><br/>Horse Sport Ireland, Teagasc and the Royal Dublin Society have been engaged during 2014 in producing a report outlining a ten-year strategy for the Sport Horse Sector. It is expected that the report will be launched shortly and will contain recommendations in regard to improving quality, delivering an education and training structure, improving the marketing and sales capacity across the entire industry, increasing participation in the sector and enhancing equine health and welfare.<br/><br/>The recommendations in the report will inform policy decisions taken in regard to the future development of the entire Sport Horse sector.</p></reply>

The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 207 of 2014 - European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2014.<br/><br/>Regulation 504/2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, requires three elements of identification to be fulfilled in respect of each equine &ndash; i.e. a single lifetime passport, a method to ensure the unequivocal link between the animal and the passport (transponder) and a database which records the identification details of the animal under a unique identification number which relates to the animal for which the passport was issued and the person responsible for identifying the animal. However, Regulation 504/2008 does not require horses which were identified in accordance with the legislation which preceded it to be micro-chipped. <br/><br/>In view of the foregoing, it would not be legally possible for my Department to impound all horses which are not micro-chipped. However, I strengthened equine identification legislation last year with the signing of S.I. 207 of 2014 European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2014, which consolidated previous secondary legislation in this area and further reinforced my powers in relation to the seizure and detention of documents and equine animals. <br/><br/>In addition, equine identification legislation has been complemented by mandatory requirements which I introduced in recent years requiring the registration of equine premises and notification of change of ownership. <i></i>In this regard, persons acquiring ownership of equines after 1 July 2014 are required to notify the  Passport Issuing Organisation which issued the horse passport of the transfer of ownership. The legislation also introduced a legal requirement on the PIO to record ownership details on the central equine database, which my Department established in 2013, when (a) a horse is first registered  with it and (b) when ownership changes take place. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the measures which I have introduced in recent years will facilitate the identification of ownership in cases where horses are found abandoned. In addition, there has been an increase in enforcement of legislation relating to the identification of equines at sales, marts, fairs, etc, and I acknowledge the successful collaboration between other agencies and my Department in this area. I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to maintain ongoing vigilance in relation to the implementation of official controls on the identification of horses.</p></reply>

The Licensing Authority is the Registrar General of Fishing Boats, an official of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or, under the superintendence of the Registrar General, the Deputy Registrar General of Fishing Boats.<br/><br/>The Act prohibits me as Minister from exercising <i>&ldquo;any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned&rdquo;</i>.<br/><br/>I have made enquiries of the Registrar General who informs me that the vessel in question was registered and licensed in the Polyvalent Segment [≥18metres length overall] Sub-segment to the named individual for the period from 17 November 2004 to 7 September 2006. <br/><br/>The Polyvalent Segment [≥18metres length overall] Sub-segment is a multipurpose Sub-segment and vessels registered and licensed therein can fish for multi-species. However the vessel in question was precluded from fishing for herring and mackerel as it does not have the required track record in these fisheries. <br/><br/>The sea-fishing boat licences issued to the named individual did not carry a restriction on fishing methods. <br/><br/>The named individual transferred ownership of the vessel, inclusive of its fishing capacity in 2006, and the vessel was registered and licensed to its new and current owner on 3 October 2006. <br/><br/>In relation to fishing effort restrictions in certain areas, EU Regulation 1342/2008 introduced a management system for fishing effort to rebuild over exploited cod stocks. The Minister established a Steering Group in February 2009 consisting of representatives of the Irish Fishing Industry, the Marine Institute, the Sea Fishing Protection Authority, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department to advise on the management arrangements for both the Irish Sea and the North West of Donegal. The full details of the scheme introduced to meet the requirements of the EU Regulation are set out in the Information note on the Department&rsquo;s website. In order to qualify for an effort allocation, all vessels registered and licensed must have a track record in a gear type and will receive fishing effort for that gear type. The qualification threshold in Area VIIa is one or more days in area VIIa in the period 2005 &ndash; 2008 using a regulated gear in Annex 1 to Council Regulation 1342/2008. The qualification threshold in Area VIa is one or more days in area VIa in the period 2006 or 2007 using a regulated gear in Annex 1 to Council Regulation 1342/2008. <br/><br/>In implementing the track record requirement, the Department is advised by the SFPA of the vessels which met the criteria for an allocation of effort. This is based on an analysis of logbook records during the relevant years. In order to qualify for an allocation of fishing effort for a particular gear type, vessels must have a record of fishing with that gear type in the area. As recommended by the Steering Group, the Minister has introduced restricted entry for certain gear types and details are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. <br/><br/>If a vessel owner considers that its vessel qualifies as having used a regulated gear in the relevant year(s), but has not been granted effort, the owner should contact the SFPA to have its logbook records reviewed for the period to see if activity with the specific gear type was missed. If this turns out to be the case the SFPA will notify the Department and the vessel will be considered as having the necessary track record for that gear type.</p></reply>

Thus the level of compensation provided reflects the real market situation at any given time and is therefore self-updating.  In addition to valuation payments, herdowners who experience a disease breakdown may also qualify for compensation under the Income Supplement, Depopulation or Hardship Grant Schemes, subject to the terms and conditions applying in each case. Payments under these schemes are designed to compensate herdowners for income losses or additional cost incurred by farmers who have animals removed as reactors. </p>  <p>  Total expenditure on compensation paid to farmers in 2014 under the TB eradication scheme amounted to &euro;15.2m.  I am satisfied that the current arrangements, which provide a very comprehensive range of financial supports to herdowners whose herds are restricted as a result of a TB breakdown in their herd, are appropriate, particularly in prevailing budgetary circumstances. </p></reply>

It is designed to specifically target environmental priorities, but it also has provision for farmers with no such priorities, but who are committed to carrying out general environmental actions on their holdings. Access to the scheme is therefore by means of three Tiers, which will allow the most pressing environmental priorities to be addressed in order of importance, but also provides for a broad approach to delivering environmental benefits across all farming systems.  In Tier 1, all farmers with Priority Environmental Assets (PEAs) get first priority access to the Scheme in year one and subsequent years. If any of the following PEAs are applicable to the holding, they must be chosen and the relevant actions planned.<br/><br/>- Farmland Habitat (private Natura sites) <br/><br/>- Farmland Birds (Twite, Breeding Waders, Chough, Geese/swans, Corncrake, Grey Partridge, Hen Harrier)<br/><br/>- Commonages<br/><br/>- High Status Water Area<br/><br/>- Rare Breeds<br/><br/>In the absence of any of the listed PEAs, a farmer (whether beef, sheep or dairy) with a whole farm stocking-rate exceeding 140kg Livestock Manure Nitrogen per hectare produced on the holding, or any farmer with more than 30 hectare of arable crops, will be considered under Tier 1 if at <i>least one</i>of the following four mandatory actions is adopted: <br/><br/><i>Mandatory actions for farms with &amp;gt;140 kg Livestock Manure Nitrogen per hectare</i><br/><br/>- Low Emission Slurry Spreading Or<br/><br/>- Wild Bird Cover (grassland farms only)<br/><br/><i>Mandatory actions for farms with &amp;gt;30 ha or arable crops</i><br/><br/>- Catch Crops Or<br/><br/>- Minimum Tillage<br/><br/>Registered Organic farmers will qualify for priority access to the scheme under Tier 1, by selecting actions appropriate to the farm.  <br/><br/>Under Tier 2, farmers who do not have Priority Environmental Assets but whose lands include a Vulnerable Water Area, may apply for access to the scheme. In such cases, the appropriate actions relevant to Vulnerable Water Areas must be selected. In the absence of a Vulnerable Water Area, an applicant may still qualify for Tier 2 access provided that one of the following actions are chosen and planned for:<br/><br/>- Low Emission Slurry Spreading<br/><br/>- Minimum Tillage<br/><br/>- Catch Crops<br/><br/>- Wild Bird Cover (grassland farms only).<br/><br/>Tier 3 sets out a list of actions which can be adopted in addition to actions laid down in Tiers 1 or 2, providing a means by which farmers can maximise their GLAS payment. However, Tier 3 also provides a mechanism by which farmers who do not fulfil any of the criteria for Tiers 1 or 2, can apply to join GLAS by committing to a series of general and valuable environmental actions. I can confirm that Tier 3 farmers are eligible to apply for GLAS in their own right.<br/><br/>The Scheme has been submitted to the European Commission as part of a suite of proposed measures under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP ). The Commission services have notified us of their observations on the Scheme, to which my Department has provided immediate and detailed replies. Discussions are now continuing with the Commission, with a view to gaining approval at the earliest possible date, so that the Scheme may be opened without delay.</p></reply>

The ANC Scheme forms part of the 2014 to 2020 Rural Development Programme, which is currently under discussion with the EU Commission. The proposal is that the existing requirements under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme will remain in place until the areas of natural constraint are delineated using soil and climatic criteria of which the following are relevant to Ireland:<br/><br/>- Soil, including Drainage, Texture &amp;amp; Stoniness, Rooting Depth;<br/><br/>- Soil &amp;amp; Climate, including Soil Moisture Balance;<br/><br/>- Terrain, including Slope.<br/><br/>An area (administrative unit) would be delineated as an Area of Natural Constraint, when it meets the proposed threshold set for one of the above criteria only. The Commission are suggesting the delineation be carried out a LAU2 level &ndash; District Electoral Division (DED) in Ireland&rsquo;s case. To qualify under the new system, an area will need to show that at least two-thirds of its utilised agricultural land meets at least one of these criteria.<br/><br/>The resultant Areas of Natural Constraint would be subject to a fine-tuning process. These, so called, Second Stage Criteria are designed to remove areas which, although they meet the biophysical criteria, are deemed to have overcome the natural disadvantage and, therefore, should not benefit under the Scheme.<br/><br/>Following the finalisation of the Teagasc innovative Irish Soil Information System, which was designed to complete the national soil survey, it is now necessary to commence the comprehensive delineation of such areas in Ireland. My Department is commencing work on the initial stages of this process, which is likely to take some time before it is fully completed. As part of the agreement reached Member States must implement the new regime by 2018 at the latest.</p></reply>

Occupational medicine focuses on a combination of preventative medicine, health promotion, medical supervision and medical assessment. Such medical oversight is necessary in order to maintain a Force that is operationally ready for the tasks assigned by Government.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Medical Corps is responsible for the delivery of medical services to Defence Forces personnel. The Medical Corps, in addition to the administrative staff of the Central Medical Unit, comprises Medical Officers ( i.e. qualified medical doctors , dentists and pharmacists ) and other medical professionals who provide the services, augmented by contracted doctors, dentists, and other specialised medical professionals engaged to provid e   medical services to the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  In relation to primary care, a key element of the medical services provided to the Defence Forces is the daily surgery, referred to as &ldquo;sick parade&rdquo;. In an ideal world sick parades would be delivered by Defence Forces Medical Officers only. However, due to a shortage of Medical Officers within the Defence Forces in recent years sick parades are delivered by a mix of Defence Forces Medical Officers and civilian doctors engaged on a contract for services basis. </p>  <p>  Additionally, in circumstances where a member of the Defence Forces requires the services of a GP after hours and he or she does not live in the vicinity of a Military Medical Facility, they may attend a local GP. Similarly, if a soldier is injured on a training exercise and requires immediate medical assistance, they can be sent to a local GP or hospital if necessary. </p>  <p>  In relation to the occupational medical service, all members of the Permanent Defence Force are required to undergo a mandatory medical examination at least once in every twelve month period. Currently all annual medical assessments are carried out by Defence Forces Medical Officers . However again due to the difficulty experienced in recruiting doctors to the Defence Forces there was a need to identify alternative options for the provision of this medical service. In this context, a Request for Tender for the provision of Occupational Medical Examinations for military personnel issued in late 2014. It is anticipated that a contract to conduct these examinations will be awarded shortly. This contract is for the provision of 1,200 occupational medical examinations. This contract is not to replace the work of the Defence Forces Medical Corps, rather it is intended that it will supplement its work in this area. </p>  <p>  It can be seen from the above that there are a number of different scenarios where a member of the Defence Forces may need to attend a general medical practitioner (be it a Defence Forces Medical Officer or a civilian doctor). </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Military Authorities that it is not possible to extract from the Medical Module of the Personnel Management System (PMS) the number of times per annum that a member of the Defence Forces is referred to a general medical practitioner. Therefore, there is no way of providing this information without examining every medical record of every member. </p>  <p>  I am also advised that further development of the PMS or implementation of a new IT system is required to enable this level of data to be recorded. I understand that work on scoping such a future medical information system has been initiated recently. </p></reply>

It provides a further mechanism for Garda&iacute; to provide crime prevention information to community contacts who in turn forward the information to all members of a community group. This initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 500 local groups involving in excess of 100,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme. I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups.<br/><br/>For many years my Department has provided funding for the Community Alert programme, which is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda authorities, and supports over 1,300 local groups.  My Department does not provide direct funding to local groups, but funding is provided in relation to the employment and associated costs of the national service, including regional Development Officers. The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to my Department to support effective community crime prevention actions. I am currently providing the maximum possible funding to Community Alert that is open to me, having regard to the overall restrictions on my Department's resources and other expenditure needs.  I understand that funding for Community Alert is also received from the HSE. <br/><br/>More generally, I am advised that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supports the Community and Voluntary Sector through a suite of schemes with a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat. A community organisation may qualify for inclusion under one or more of these schemes, should it meet the terms and conditions of a particular scheme managed by the Department.

To date, a decision has been made on 87% of the applications received and 498 applicants have received their lump sum at a cost of over &euro;18m.<br/><br/>Judge Quirke recommended that the women should have access to an enhanced medical card.  He also specifically recommended that legislation be introduced to give effect to this recommendation.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, I am bringing forward the Bill (the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014) later this week for consideration by the D&aacute;il and I hope, with the cooperation of the Oireachtas, that the Bill will be enacted very promptly.<br/><br/>This Bill makes special provision for free access to health services for women who worked in the 12 specified institutions.<br/><br/>The women are already covered by section 21 (appointment of a care representative) under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  Judge Quirke recommended provision for a mechanism whereby a person can be appointed to act in the best interests of a woman who receives an <i>ex-gratia</i>payment under the scheme where she lacks capacity.  This is being done through the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill, currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Dail.<br/><br/>Judge Quirke&rsquo;s recommendation regarding top up pension type payments is being fully implemented.  This recommendation proposes that eligible women should in addition and without regard to the &quot;lump&quot; sum payments receive weekly payments of &euro;100 if under 66 and the equivalent of the State Contributory pension - &euro;230.30 - if over 66 for the remainder of their lives.  These payments are to be calculated net of other State benefits.<br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection have set up a separate scheme to give effect to this  recommendation and they are continuing to process payments on a phased basis.<br/><br/>The Government decided that the commencement date for the Scheme was 1 August 2013 so therefore, regardless of when an applicant makes an application, if eligible for the scheme, will have appropriate payments backdated to 1 August 2013.<br/><br/>The only issue of back dating mentioned by Judge Quirke is in his 7th Recommendation in which he states, <i>&quot;Where a written &ldquo;expression of interest&rdquo; (or other written application for inclusion within the proposed Scheme) has been provided to the State by or on behalf of a Magdalen woman who was alive on or after the 19th of February 2013 then that woman will be eligible for consideration to be included within the Scheme. Additional income ex gratia payments (payable to women entitled to payments in excess of &euro;50,000) will not accrue to the benefit of the estate of any Magdalen woman.&rdquo;</i></p></reply>

As I indicated in those responses, the reason that the General Scheme requires the assisted reproduction treatment to be carried out in a clinical setting is because there is very clear case-law on the situation of a donor father where the treatment takes place outside a clinical setting to the effect that he has all the rights of a father to apply for guardianship and access. The requirement for the treatment to be carried out in a clinical setting will enable the respective rights of a child, a birth mother, a father or second female parent and any donor to be safeguarded as clear procedures can be put in place regarding the consent of the parties to the treatment.<br/><br/>As I also pointed out in that response, there are other provisions in the General Scheme which would enable a couple who have had a child through non-clinical assisted reproduction both to have a legal relationship with the child.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort. The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.<br/><br/>Deportations take place within the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and after each case has been fully considered with regard to the eleven considerations contained in Section 3 (6) of that Act and Section 5 Prohibition of refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996.<br/><br/>The safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.<font color="#000080"> </font>My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries, including Tanzania.<br/><br/>Each asylum application is considered on the basis of the facts, individual circumstances and merits of the case presented and a final decision is reached following a comprehensive examination and investigation of these facts, merits and circumstances taking full account of the political and human rights conditions prevailing in the Country  and the latest reports of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.<br/><br/>The enforcement of a Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. In general, removals are either carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return.<br/><br/>It would be inappropriate of me to comment on individual cases.  However, I can say that, as outlined above, the facts of each case are considered including all information available regarding the country of origin of the applicant, before a final decision regarding deportation is made. In the case in question the allegations that have been made continue to be treated with the utmost seriousness. In that respect my officials are making every reasonable effort to establish the true facts of the alleged incident. This includes contact with relevant organisations as well as utilising the services of the Irish embassy in the city in question.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<br/><br/>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325</i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. </i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<br/><br/>I can inform the Deputy that a  new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse. </p></reply>

The strategy reflects on current international research and practice which indicate that better outcomes can be achieved through utilising gender informed approaches in dealing with women.  The support of the community and voluntary sector will be crucial to implementing the new interagency women&rsquo;s strategy.  T&uacute;s Nua is a residential project for women offenders funded by my Department through the Probation Service.  T&uacute;s Nua works closely with the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service to support women offenders to reintegrate into the community on their release from custody.  <br/><br/>To date the Probation Service has continued to work in partnership with the IPS to put in place targeted responses in relation to women offenders.  This is undertaken under the auspices of the sentence management process.  The Probation Service has provided an in reach service to work with women in Limerick prison.  Dedicated Probation Officers in the community have been identified and introduced on a phased basis where there are significant numbers of women offenders.  Gender informed guidelines for assessment have been drafted and training is due to commence.  Women specific Community Service and Community Return options are being identified on an ongoing basis.  Links have been established with the Probation Board for Northern Ireland and a joint PS/IPS visit has been undertaken to the INSPIRE project in Belfast.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Strategic Review of Penal Policy Report which I launched in September 2014 recommends a greater focus on step-down facilities, supported accommodation and the use of more community based open conditions for female offenders.  In November 2014, the Government gave its approval, in principle, to proceed immediately with the implementation of a number of key recommendations including pursuing options for an open prison for female offenders.<br/><br/>Finally, the Abigail Centre in Finglas, Dublin opened in December 2014 which is a new service to meet the needs of vulnerable women that require supported accommodation for a temporary period, some of whom will have moved there directly on release from prison.</p></reply>

Through these fora, the Irish Prison Service, in partnership inter alia with the Probation Service, has been working to ensure that the unique circumstances of homeless offenders are taken into account in the development and provision of preventative and other supporting actions for persons who are vulnerable to homelessness.<br/><br/>As a direct consequence, of the Irish Prison Service raising this issue, my colleague Alan Kelly the Minister of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government has included an action (15) in the National Action Plan on Homelessness which states that 'staff from the Department of Social Protection will work with housing authorities and the Irish Prison Service to provide an appropriate in-reach service to all prison settings to ensure that prisoners are assisted to find accommodation before release.'<br/><br/>In recent years, a weekly service was being provided in twelve prisons (all prisons and open centres excluding Cork and Limerick Prisons) by the Department of Social Protection Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Person's Unit (HPU).  Referrals to the Department of Social Protection service generally occur at the pre-release stage where emergency and other accommodation options, and income maintenance can be arranged by the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs).  The Department of Social Protection in-reach service is invaluable for the successful resettlement of offenders and a vital component of pre-release planning.  It is widely recognised across the prison estate that in order to provide this service to all inmates, an increase in service provision is required. <br/><br/>In the Homeless Strategy National Implementation Plan the Irish Prison Service was assigned a priority action 'to improve discharge planning for all individuals leaving prisons to include identification of housing needs and follow up supports, through close links between those discharging institutions, housing providers and community based services'.  I am happy to report to the Deputy that a new pre-release planning policy for the Irish Prison Service is at an advanced stage and will represent considerable improvements to current pre-release planning and practices in Irish prisons.  It is envisaged that a new central information window on the Prisoner Information Management System (PIMS) will record a range of information with regard to post release concerns and plans for individual prisoners which will improve transition to the community and reduce occurrences of ex-offenders becoming homeless post release. <br/><br/>  With regard to women prisoners specifically, a joint Women's Strategy document for the IPS and the Probation Service was published in April 2014.  The issues being addressed include rehabilitation, housing and reintegration to the broader community, and apart from the IPS include engagement with the HSE, the Department of Education (VEC), NGOs, the National Council for Women, and areas within the Justice family.  The Abigail Women's Centre in Finglas, Dublin opened in December 2014 and represents a major contribution to the realisation of the IPS/Probation Service joint women's strategy.  The Abigail Women&rsquo;s Centre is a 40 bed, low threshold facility providing supported temporary accommodation for homeless women in Dublin. <br/><br/>As part of the National Drugs Strategy 2009 - 2016 a protocol was developed between the IPS and the HSE for the continuation of drug treatment services as a person moves between prison (including prisoners on remand) and the community.</p></reply>

I will, of course, respond to the organisation regarding their report in due course.<br/><br/>This Government has put in place a number of legislative provisions regarding protection of the family home in cases where repossession of the property is being sought. <b></b><i>Section 2</i>of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 provides that in repossession proceedings involving a principal private residence, a court may, where it considers it appropriate or on application by a borrower, adjourn the proceedings to enable the parties to consider whether a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 would be a more appropriate alternative to repossession.  The intention is to ensure that lending institutions do not resort to repossession proceedings without considering the PIA option under the 2012 Act. The section will not apply to investment or commercial properties.  In effect, section 2 provides a new, final, time-limited opportunity for court adjournment of repossession proceedings for the possibility of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement to be examined as an alternative to repossession.  <br/><br/>A PIA may be entered into following a court adjournment as indicated above or through the main route set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 via engagement with a Personal Insolvency Practitioner and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  In addition, I should point out that a PIA provides statutory protection to the borrower and may enable them to remain in their home while resolving the debt in a sustainable manner. <br/><br/>This Government has provided an enhanced range of information and guidance services for mortgage holders, including a dedicated information website, a mortgage arrears information and advice helpline and the provision of independent financial advice for mortgage holders who are being presented with long-term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by qualified accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service. I would encourage people to avail of this service, where appropriate.<br/><br/>I think that it is also proper to reiterate that the Government's advice has always been that borrowers who find themselves in arrears should engage with their lending institution with a view to reaching a solution to their difficulties.</p></reply>

The applications referred to, totalling 1,363 applications, were refused by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and not by the Courts.  I have arranged to have the D&aacute;il record corrected to reflect that fact. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Working Group Report on the review of firearms licensing, published for consultation in November 2013, sets out views expressed by members of the judiciary in relation to legislative provisions governing firearms.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases before the Courts.  However, I am advised that over the past four years, Judges in District Courts have commented that it is a matter for the legislature and not the judiciary to address the concerns of senior Garda Officers tasked with considering applications to licence, in particular, large calibre handguns and semi automatic centre fire rifles.  For example, I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Judge Lucey, in various District Courts throughout the country, Judge O&lsquo;Kelly in Limerick District Court and Judge Kennedy in Bray District Court have dealt with the issue that as the legislation currently allows for the licensing of such firearms, the law must be applied as it currently exists.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have advised that judges have raised issues in relation to interpreting Section 33 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which prohibits 'practical or dynamic shooting'.  I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Judge Riordan in Cork District Court, Judge McNulty in Bandon District Court, Judge Larkin in Kilmallock District Court, Judge Neylon in Mullingar District Court and Judge Kelleher in Cork District Court have commented on the difficulties in interpreting what exactly constitutes 'a form of activity in which firearms are used to simulate combat or combat training', which was a central issue in appeal cases before these courts. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Judge Durcan, in a written judgment in Ennis District Court on 5 November, 2014, addressed an issue relating to the interpretation of the legislation when he stated: &ldquo;By way of casual initial observation, it must be said that the manner of amendment adopted by the legislature with respect to the Firearms Code is to be regretted.  The 2006 Act amends substantially fourteen of the thirty sections of the Principal Act, six important sections of the Principal Act being completely amended by substitution.  The 2009 Act contains an additional 20 sections which effect considerable amendments to the code.  It is highly unsatisfactory that the code must now be read by reference to a number of different statutes, when the opportunity could have been taken to provide a consolidating statute.  Despite developments in information technology and the empowerment of computer consolidation, Statue Law should be easily accessible not merely to Lawyers and Legislators, but also to ordinary citizens in a comprehensible manner&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The Deputy has also raised the question of the ability of the Garda PULSE system to produce figures on the number of cases which were appealed to the District Court and how many were granted.  The Deputy will appreciate that firearms legislation provides for an appeal to the District Court where a firearms licence has been refused by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am informed that the information sought regarding such cases is not readily available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Courts Service.  The work required to collate this information could only be retrieved by way of a manual examination of each individual court record.  This would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have advised that refused renewal applications for restricted firearms that were subsequently granted on appeal are no longer recorded on PULSE as refused or appealed.  These applications are updated on the system to show the application as granted.  I understand this new method of updating the licensing system on PULSE was introduced to address concerns of interest groups, so that licence holders granted a licence after an appeal do not have an initial refusal recorded on their licence record.</p></reply>

To that end full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  </p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.</p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.   </p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the need to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, I do not think that this time period is unreasonable.  </p></reply>

The programme is based on the primary school model, under which primary schools are required to open on 193 days per year (equivalent to 38.6 weeks).  There are no plans to increase the current provision within the pre-school year or to extend the age range for eligibility.  It is estimated that increasing the number of hours to 3.5 per day for the current cohort of eligible children would cost in the region of &euro;28 million.  <br/><br/>There is an increasing body of Irish and international evidence quantifying the benefits of early years interventions in terms of improving outcomes for children and in delivering significant and societal return to the State.  In this context, I believe that the introduction of a second free pre-school year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br/><br/>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding which is not currently available.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.

Ensuring the best possible outcomes for children in their early years is therefore an important element in future economic planning. </p>  <p>  The case for investing in children and young people on both social and economic grounds is supported by a body of international evidence.  As the Minister with responsibility for this key area, I have established a cross-Departmental group at senior level to develop a whole-of-Government approach to future investment in early childhood care and education and after-school care.  The group will undertake an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality childhood care and education services. </p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcome for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  The importance of this area is reinforced by continuing economic improvement and job growth and an increased focus on activation for those currently outside the labour market.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the potential benefits can be realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  It must look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  It is crucial, therefore, that we develop a coherent cross-Government approach to investment in childcare services.</p>  <p>  The group which I propose to establish will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  I will be asking that the work of this group be carried out within a relatively short time frame and I expect that the group will be in a position to report to me in the Summer.</p></reply>

The pre-school service referred to by the Deputy is participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p>  <p>  The ECCE programme is a free and universal programme which provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children.  For the academic year 2014/2015, based on the higher capitation rate payments of &euro;73 per child per week and its current enrolment, this service will be entitled to total funding in the region of &euro;83,000 under this programme. </p>  <p>  In addition to this universal provision, there are targeted schemes in place to help parents on low incomes with childcare costs when participating in education, training and when moving from welfare to work.  These include the three Training and Employment Support programmes.  Together with the Community Childcare Subvention Programme (which is open only to community not-for-profit childcare services) and the ECCE programme, these programmes represent an annual investment of approximately &euro;260 million and support the parents of more than 100,000 children.  This service should engage with the local City/County Childcare Committee to establish if it is eligible to participate in any further childcare support programmes.</p>  <p>  I recently announced a proposal to establish a cross-Departmental group at senior level to develop a whole-of-Government approach to future investment in early childhood care and education and after-school care.  The group will undertake an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality childhood care and education services. </p>  <p>  The group, which will be chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, will include representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education &amp;amp; Skills, Social Protection, Jobs &amp;amp; Innovation, Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and Finance.  It is intended that the group will report to Government in the Summer.</p></reply>

Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services have their accommodation needs identified as part of this support.</p>  <p>  Last year, a protocol was established between the County and City Management Association and the Child and Family Agency in relation to the assessment of housing needs for young people leaving care, the interaction between interagency aftercare committees and local authority housing representatives and how to progress such accommodation related matters.  The aim of the protocol is to make the assessment and allocation of social housing, where deemed to be the most appropriate response to the young person&rsquo;s need, more efficient and seamless.  This protocol came about through the collaboration of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Child and Family Agency. </p>  <p>  The protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.</p>  <p>  During the course of discussions with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the issue of the particular vulnerability of young people leaving State care, as highlighted in the first report to Government of the Homelessness Oversight Group, was considered.  Discussions between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have been ongoing in relation to matters of accommodation for those leaving the care of the State and how they might be best supported.</p>  <p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living.  The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that can be so important in realising positive outcomes.  It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.</p>  <p>  It has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.</p></reply>

My Department, in the normal course of its work, has ongoing contact with Departments and Agencies on a range of issues relating to children.  During the coming year such contacts will comprehend preparations for engagement with the UN Committee.</p>  <p>  Aftercare is a term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.</p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.</p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.</p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  The Child and Family Agency advised that at the end of June 2014, 1,614 young people aged 18-23 years (inclusive) were in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 884 (55%) were in full-time education.</p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.  The situation regarding the establishment of these committees varies nationally but it is expected that all committees will be operational by mid-2015. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the legislative provisions regarding aftercare are being strengthened to respond to past concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of this year.</p>  <p>  Other matters raised by the Deputy in this instance come within the area of responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Health, respectively.  Should the Deputy wish to obtain information about these matters, it is open to him to direct his questions accordingly.</p></reply>

If therefore, an Applicant dies at any time after application and before she has accepted an award, the claim shall lapse and the Applicant&rsquo;s estate and her spouse and/or members of her family shall not be entitled to any award or payment under this Scheme.  In these circumstances, the Assessor retains discretion regarding payment of the costs of the Application where the Applicant has retained a solicitor.  The Assessor&rsquo;s decision under this paragraph shall be final and not subject to appeal.</p>  <p>  Section 39 of the Terms of the Scheme states that if an Applicant has accepted an award and has satisfied all the other conditions of acceptance but dies before payment of the award has been made by the Minister, then such award shall upon her death become payable to her estate and be recoverable in due course by her legal personal representative(s) as a simple contract debt due by the Minister to the Applicant's estate. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for you.</p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. <br/><br/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. <br/><br/>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br/><br/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25th July 2014. The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering.  These engagements have been completed and the HSE is now considering the outcome of those commercial engagements.  Fampridine will be assessed along with a range of other applications for reimbursement of medicines for multiple sclerosis and other diseases.</p></reply>

In doing so, the HPRA is required to have regard to a comprehensive set of qualifying conditions, all of which must be complied with before a decision is taken to make a medicinal product interchangeable. </p>  <p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price the HSE will reimburse to pharmacists for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.</p>  <p>  For any medicine that is listed as being interchangeable the legislation provides that a Pharmacist may offer a generic or alternative version of the branded medicine which is set at the reference price.  Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products priced at or below the reference price.  If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product. </p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Act provides that where a branded interchangeable product is prescribed for a patient and the prescriber is satisfied that the medicinal product, should for clinical reasons, be exempted from substitution, the prescriber shall write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription.  In these cases, the pharmacist must dispense what is written on the prescription, i.e. is not permitted to substitute with any product in the same group of interchangeable products and patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.</p></reply>

All of these, including St Conlon&rsquo;s Nursing Unit, Nenagh and Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit, Roscrea are registered with HIQA.  Notwithstanding the problems that some facilities face with structures and facilities, the vast majority of their residents receive excellent levels of care. Without these public facilities many older people would simply have nowhere to go, other than our acute hospitals which are already under pressure.  It is therefore very important that the services provided by public facilities be maintained.</p>  <p>  Demand for capital investment for the Community Nursing Unit programme far exceeds the funding available, and investment must therefore be allocated as effectively as possible based on the HSE's assessment of priorities.</p>  <p>  HIQA has indicated that a number of units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home.  This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes.  However, there is adequate flexibility available within the terms of existing legislative provisions, and through ongoing discussions between the HSE and HIQA, for solutions to be found. In this context the HSE has been working with HIQA over the past number of months to meet the re-registration requirements of these units, and my Department is closely monitoring the situation.</p></reply>

It is marketed in tablets containing 25, 50 and 100 micrograms and is the subject of a marketing authorisation in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) became aware of shortages of Eltroxin tablets during the week of 1 December 2014. On becoming aware of the shortage the HPRA contacted the manufacturer. This was not however a formal investigation but part of the HPRA's activities in managing disruption in supply of a medicine. It is understood that this shortage was  due to a regulatory non-compliance by the manufacturer. The non-compliance was that a registered in-process test was not being applied during manufacture of current batches of Eltroxin. Over the following days, a number of &lsquo;fast track&rsquo; regulatory requests (variations), submitted by the manufacturer, were approved by the HPRA in order to allow for the release of batches of tablets onto the Irish Market.</p>  <p>  As part of its routine post marketing activities, the HPRA continues to monitor and investigate issues relating to disruption in supply. In the event of a shortage of a medicine to patients, HPRA will attempt to minimise the impact on patients by:</p>  <p>  - working with pharmaceutical companies to resolve manufacturing and distribution issues;</p>  <p>  - sharing information with the HSE and international partners about alternative sources of supply;</p>  <p>  - seeking input from the HSE, patient groups and healthcare professionals on the impact of medicine shortages, to support decision-making;</p>  <p>  - taking measures to allow alternative medicines or suppliers to be used;</p>  <p>  - having in place a fast track regulatory mechanism (known as &lsquo;batch specific request&rsquo;) to permit packs of a medicine intended for another market to be modified to meet the requirements of the authorisation to market the product in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - operating a notification system relating to the sourcing by distributors of exempt (unauthorised) medicines to meet the special needs of patients. This can include the sourcing of an exempt alternative where there is a shortage of the authorised product.</p>  <p>  Parallel exporting is the exporting of medicines intended for use in one market to other countries in the European Economic Area (EEA).  EU law provides for the free movement of goods across borders within the EU so the practice of parallel import and parallel export of medicines is legal.  Member States may restrict the free movement of goods only in exceptional cases, for example when there is a risk resulting from issues such as public health, environment, or consumer protection. In September 2011, the HPRA wrote to the majority of wholesalers regarding the public service obligations contained in the Irish Medicines Regulations. The HPRA closely monitors the situation and if it is found that a product shortage may have been due to parallel trading, the HPRA will investigate.</p>  <p>  At present, the HPRA is not aware of any shortage in supply of Eltroxin in Ireland.

Each year approximately 1,500 nurses complete the nursing degree programme. This is the number seen as necessary to maintain nursing numbers at the level required to support service delivery.</p>  <p>  There was a requirement to reduce public service numbers and maximise savings in the public service from the time of the downturn in the economy. The embargo on recruitment introduced by the HSE in 2007, followed by the moratorium on recruitment resulted in a fall of about 4,500 in nursing numbers between 2007 and the middle of 2013. Nursing numbers have increased by nearly 500 in the past 12 months. This increase can be attributed to the very positive initiatives undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full time posts. It is noteworthy that the number of nurses who have made requests for verification to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland &ndash; a requirement if they intend leaving the country - fell by 400 in 2014, meaning that this additional number wish to remain in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. This is reflected in the current recruitment campaign where the HSE is actively recruiting to fill 1,600 approved nursing posts. These are across all grades and all divisions of the register spanning acute hospitals, community, ID and mental health.</p>  <p>  Many of these posts are currently being filled on a temporary or an acting basis. Following a high profile online campaign at the end of 2014 the HSE is currently processing 3,700 applications for nurses (all divisions of the register across all areas) to meet current needs. These applicants will be interviewed and their applications processed over the next number of weeks.  </p>  <p>  However, there will always be certain posts that are difficult to attract suitably qualified candidates to and individual strategies are developed for these in conjunction with the line managers. Where front-line staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure continued service provision, including recourse to agency cover. However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of nurses are recruited to permanent posts to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services.  </p></reply>

I have therefore written last week to the President of the Board of NMBI and asking that options be explored to bring a resolution to issues surrounding the annual retention fee.  I recognise that the Board must meet its obligations within the financial resources available. At the same time this demands that obligations are met on the most economic basis possible and all planned expenditure can be demonstrated as necessary. </p>  <p>  I have again requested that the Board of NMBI re-engage in discussions with the staff associations, as a matter of urgency. An outcome must be found which secures the Board&rsquo;s minimum financial operating requirements but avoids a scenario where nurses and midwives are removed from the Register for non-payment of fees with potential consequences for service availability. </p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation closely in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care. </p>  <p>  I have offered that both my officials and I are available to engage with the Board should that be of assistance.</p>  <p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  </p>  <p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-27a.777.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012700077#WRR03000"><p>The Board is governed by the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 and is a legal entity in its own right. Its accountability to the Minister for Health is set out in statute and in this regard the Minister may for example direct the Board to amend a statement of strategy submitted to him under section 18. Having regard to the relevant sections of the Act, there is a certain amount of accountability to the Houses for example the Act requires the Minister to lay a copy of the statement of strategy before each House of the Oireachtas. The Minister can also lay the business plan submitted to him before the Oireachtas and the annual reports are also laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Board. Further all rules made under section 13 and approved by the Minister must be laid and annulled. It should be noted that the Board&rsquo;s accounts are also examined by the Comptroller and Auditors General&rsquo;s Office. In this regard the accounts for 2012 and 2013 were recently published and arrangements will be made to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The Board is an independent body, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  </p>  <p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  </p>  <p>  I am concerned regarding the implications for the health service and patient safety should the current impasse over the annual retention fee increase continue. I have therefore written last week to the President of the Board of NMBI asking that options be explored to bring a resolution to issues surrounding the annual retention fee.  I recognise that the Board must meet its obligations within the financial resources available. This also demands that obligations are met on the most economic basis possible and all planned expenditure can be demonstrated as necessary. I requested that the Board of NMBI re-engage in discussions with the staff associations, as a matter of urgency. I have offered that both my officials and I are available to engage with the Board should that be of assistance.</p>  <p>  An outcome must be found which secures the Board&rsquo;s minimum financial operating requirements but avoids a scenario where nurses and midwives are removed from the Register for non-payment of fees with potential consequences for service availability. I will continue to monitor the situation closely in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care.</p></reply>

The reason for allowing this period to elapse was to ensure that the Scheme had bedded in and that established trends would be available in order to inform the work of the Review.  The Review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by an external service provider on specific issues which required specialised expertise.</p>  <p>  A call for written submissions to inform the review was made on the 16th June 2012. In total 61 submissions were received from a broad range of individuals, nursing homes, statutory bodies, groups representing the interest of older people, private/commercial bodies and organisations in the community and voluntary sector. A summary report of the submissions was published on the Department's website in December 2012.</p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference for the Review are:</p>  <p>  Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation:-</p>  <p>  1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,</p>  <p>  2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices,</p>  <p>  3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services,</p>  <p>  4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health),</p>  <p>  5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The elements of the Review that relate to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme itself are well-defined, but an effective assessment of the Scheme for the future requires consideration of where it fits within the spectrum of services and supports for older people, and of how the make-up of and balances within this spectrum may change over time. This exercise is broader than was first envisaged and the various issues arising are now being  systematically considered with a view to completion and publication as early as possible. It is expected that the Review will be completed by the end of this quarter and the report will then be made publicly available.</p></reply>

All of these are registered with HIQA. Notwithstanding the problems that some facilities face with structures and facilities, the vast majority of their residents receive excellent levels of care. Without these public facilities many older people would simply have nowhere to go, other than our acute hospitals which are already under pressure. It is therefore very important that the services provided by public facilities be maintained. </p>  <p>  Demand for capital investment for the Community Nursing Unit programme far exceeds the funding available, and investment must therefore be allocated as effectively as possible based on the HSE's assessment of priorities. </p>  <p>  HIQA has indicated that a number of units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home.  This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes. However, there is adequate flexibility available within the terms of existing legislative provisions, and through ongoing discussions between the HSE and HIQA, for solutions to be found. In this context the HSE has been working with HIQA over the past number of months to meet the re-registration requirements of these units, and my Department is closely monitoring the situation. </p></reply>

The Act provides that persons, unable without undue hardship having regard to their overall financial situation to arrange GP services for themselves and family, qualify for a medical card. The Deputy will also be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.<br/><br/>The HSE has discretion, exercised in accordance with the legislation, to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  <br/><br/>In the light of the conclusions of the two reports a range of actions have been identified to improve the operation of the medical card system, particularly for people with significant medical needs. The HSE has appointed a senior manager to lead the reform of the systems for handling medical card application and reviews. Under one of the actions, the HSE is taking steps to establish a clinical advisory group to develop a methodology and guidance for the assessment of applications involving significant medical conditions so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them. The HSE is also putting arrangements in place for a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications involving significant medical conditions to ensure greater interaction between the central office regarding the assessment of a person&rsquo;s eligibility and the local health office regarding the person&rsquo;s medical condition and the services that they may require. Consequently, the number of medical cards issued, where the HSE has exercised discretion, has increased from approximately 50,300 at the start of 2014 to approximately 76,700 at the start of 2015.<br/><br/>The Minister and I have also asked the HSE to examine, with the Department of Health, the best way to meet the needs of people with significant medical conditions who need the support of the public health system. This work includes considering the best way to make medical aids and appliances available to persons who do not hold a medical card, the provision of services to children with severe disabilities, and to enable people with particular needs to have these met on an individual basis rather than awarding a medical card to all family members.</p></reply>

Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  </p>  <p>  The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.  </p>  <p>  In December 2014 the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. </p>  <p>  Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and its findings will be a precursor to any disciplinary process consideration at which the HSE will undertake. Mr Lynch is both nationally and internationally recognised as a champion for people with a disability and a leader in the implementation of innovative supports.  His independence in relation to this issue should not be questioned, as his proven track record in fighting for people with a disability speaks for itself.</p>  <p>  Dr McCoy is undertaking an Assurance Review of the services at &Aacute;ras Attracta and the final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex.  The review will identify system wide learning involving engagement with relevant expertise as well as input from staff. </p>  <p>  A Garda investigation into allegations of abuse at the centre is ongoing and the Garda had requested that a stay be placed on HSE investigations until such time as the Garda investigation is completed. However, the HSE has informed me that garda&iacute; have now cleared the way for the investigation to commence. Following the lift of a Garda stay, I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.</p>  <p>  On 16 December 2014, the Director General of the HSE announced the appointment of Ms Leigh Gath as Confidential Recipient in respect of complaints or disclosures of abuse of vulnerable persons in receipt of HSE funded services. Ms Gath has been a fearless advocate and a champion for people with a disability for many years and will, no doubt, provide a strong and independent voice in her role. I am informed by the HSE that Ms Gath took up her duties with effect from Monday 22 December 2014 </p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, disability providers are delivering an increasing proportion of services and supports which are individualised and person-centred and the HSE is actively working with disability providers towards the migration of more services in 2015 to this person-centred supports model.</p>  <p>  Further work is necessary before decisions can be taken on the form or forms which individualised budgeting will take, but the essence of it will be that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised.</p>  <p>  In the meantime there are demonstration projects underway which are looking at all aspects of providing more person-centred and accountable supports for people with disabilities and these projects are providing a valuable insight into the issues arising.</p>  <p>  The other points made in the details attached by the Deputy touch on the responsibilities of a number of my colleagues as well as myself, and I will make sure that my colleagues are made aware of these.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to &Aacute;ras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.</p></reply>

During the course of this Government HIQA&rsquo;s function has been extended to residential services for those with disabilities and child protection services. </p>  <p>  As regulator, HIQA&rsquo;s remit operates at the level of facilities rather than that of individual complaints, but the requirements at facility level impact very directly on how individual cases are dealt with.</p>  <p>  All nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure, including an appeals process. They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.  Records of complaints made are required to be kept.  These are available for inspection, thus enabling the HIQA inspector to determine whether the complaints system is sufficiently robust. </p>  <p>  HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity, and information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this context.  HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.  If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. HIQA also has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with both HIQA and the service providers, is working on an ongoing basis to improve and update the requirements that apply to nursing home care. Any request from HIQA for an extension of their remit on the lines suggested by the Deputy will be carefully considered.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.  </p>  <p>  Pending decisions on a new scheme, monthly payments will continue to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed.  The Motorised Transport Grant is closed.</p></reply>

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.   Providing public residential care for older persons forms a significant and crucial part of the services provided.  Our overall objective is to protect the viability of as many units as possible, within the funding and staffing resources available.  Therefore improving the supports available for older persons is a significant commitment in our Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  All developments must be addressed in the light of the resources available and based on priority of need.  HIQA has indicated that a number of units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home.  This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes.  Currently the funding for the Community Nursing Unit (CNU) programme focuses on the upgrade and refurbishment of existing facilities to achieve HIQA compliance.    </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services.  This includes provision of the appropriate infrastructure which supports service delivery, such as the facilities at this particular location.  Given that demand for capital finance for the Community Nursing Unit programme alone far exceeds the funding available, investment must be allocated as objectively as possible, based on the HSE's assessment of priorities of needs.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has identified this location as a priority location for a new Community Nursing Home unit.  The design team has been appointed.  Currently it is projected that a planning application could be lodged with the local authority in Q2 2015.  Following the award of planning it is expected that the project will progress to the tendering / construction phase in late 2015.   In advance of the award of planning permission it is not possible, at this point in time to be definitive about a time frame for completion once work begins, other than to say that it is possible that the construction of a CNU could be completed within twelve months of appointing a contractor.  All Government Departments and agencies, including the HSE, that are funded from the Exchequer must comply with EU Directives and national guidelines on procurement and in this regard the HSE's selection of a contractor will be in accordance with this process.  </p>  <p>  As with all capital projects, the CNU infrastructure programme which includes this project, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  There is limited funding available for new projects, over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019, given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.    Therefore the reason capital funding is not ring-fenced by project is to ensure that the HSE has flexibility to manage within its voted capital allocation in the event that one or more of the hundreds of construction projects underway at any time do not progress as scheduled.  Indenting rather than ring-fencing enables the HSE, to leverage its capital allocation efficiently, so that it delivers the maximum number of priority projects for the funding available.</p></reply>

In December 2013, An Taoiseach Enda Kenny visited Japan where he met with Prime Minister Abe. Together they launched the Japan-Ireland Partnership for Innovation and Growth. The Taoiseach was accompanied for part of this visit by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Mr. Simon Coveney, T.D. During this visit it was also announced that Japan was lifting its ban on Irish beef imports, which was a very positive development for our beef industry.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of Ministerial visits to Japan with a trade dimension in recent years. In 2011, then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. &Eacute;amon Gilmore T.D., visited Japan where he attended a series of trade-related events. In 2012, Minister of State Sean Sherlock, in his then role as Minister of State for Research and Innovation, visited Japan as part of an Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led trade mission.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led overseas trade missions and events, with the involvement of EI client companies and organised with the active support of my Department&rsquo;s Embassy network, are an important element of the Government Trade, Tourism, and Investment Strategy, which recognises the valuable role they play in developing and creating new trade, tourism and investment opportunities for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Early each year I agree the annual programme of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led overseas trade missions and events with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, based on the proposals submitted by Enterprise Ireland and focused on the priority markets of interest to their client companies. The programme for 2015 has not yet been finalised but I expect it to be launched in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I am advised that companies interested in participating in Enterprise Ireland trade missions should make their interest known to the International Sales and Partnering Division of Enterprise Ireland directly.</p></reply>

The decision to vote against the Resolution was taken on the basis of its substance and the procedural issues involved. 128 UN member States voted in favour of the resolution, 16, including 10 EU member States voted against and there were 34 abstentions.</p>  <p>  In the lead up to the vote, the EU had made extensive efforts and engaged with the proponents of the resolution in the informal negotiation process, coming forward with a range of substantive ideas on moving the process forward.  </p>  <p>  Despite these efforts, the text of the resolution, which was tabled by Argentina, did not reflect any of the progress made in the informal discussions, and failed to take account of any of the EU proposals. This made it impossible for the EU to support the draft resolution.</p>  <p>  The earlier Human Rights Council resolution, &ldquo;Effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights: the activities of vulture funds&rdquo;, which was also tabled by Argentina, was wider in scope than the UN General Assembly resolution. This broader scope enabled Ireland to abstain.   Among the 9 EU member states on the Human Rights council, six abstained and three voted against.   </p>  <p>  Together with many other UN member States, Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring. Ireland considers that the work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held Addis Ababa in July, offer more appropriate and established means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. Ireland will play our full role in working for the success of this crucially important meeting in Addis, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland and Kenya. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support processes aimed at resolving global debt issues through dialogue, in the most appropriate forum and using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms to support the countries most seriously affected.</p></reply>

While it is not the practice to comment on individual applications, I can advise that the recommendations made against applications for exemptions in 2014 related in the majority of cases to munitions that are non-discriminatory in their effects.

Department of Education and Skills Circular 0008/2013 outlines the effect of this decision on teachers. </p>  <p>  In Paragraph 12 of Circular 0008/2013 an exception is made in the case "where as at 5 December 2011, a teacher in employment on that date and eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of the post they held on that date, was actively undertaking a course of further study leading to an additional qualification, provided that the teacher does not cease to be a registered student on that course before its completion. Such individuals may apply to the Department/VEC (now ETB) as appropriate for a derogation from the general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award." Teachers who were not in employment in an Oireachtas funded post on 5 December 2011 and not eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of any teaching post on that date, do not qualify for payment of an allowance in respect of the qualification related to the course being undertaken at that time.</p>  <p>  The issues raised by the Deputy have been brought to the Teachers' Conciliation Council (TCC) by representatives of the teachers concerned and it would therefore not be appropriate to comment further until the issues have been deliberated on by that forum.

Analysis of labour market transitions in 2013 indicated a high turnover for food operatives, suggesting retention issues. Evaluation of the recent training programme provided in the National Butchery Academy, referred to below, also indicated issues with attracting and retaining staff following completion of the course.<br/><br/>The conclusion outlined in the National Skills Bulletin 2014 was that while no shortages of meat processing skills have been identified, it is recognised that many food processing companies are experiencing difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled butchers/de-boners.<br/><br/>In 2011 the National Butchery Association (NBA) identified some skills gaps and employment opportunities in the primary meat processing sector in respect of beef de-boners and industrial butchers.  <br/><br/>A F&Aacute;S-funded training course subsequently commenced in Ballinasloe, Co. Galway for 50 participants for 20 weeks.  The course was independently evaluated and its principle findings included:<br/><br/>-  The Programme did not achieve its outcome target of 90% of learners being placed in employment.<br/><br/>-  The work placement module emerged as the weakest element of the Programme.<br/><br/>As a consequence of the pilot SOLAS currently does not offer any courses in this area. It is considered international best practice for such training to be industry led and some examples of employer-led initiatives through the Skillnets framework are below.  However, if there were demand and an appropriate business case, local ETBs could offer such courses.<br/><br/>Skillnets, the State funded industry-led training facilitator, includes two networks who provide training for Meat Industry Operatives - the Taste4Success Skillnet and Food and Drink Industry Ireland Skillnet.<br/><br/>Taste4Success delivered the following courses in 2014 specifically for operatives in the meat industry, training approx 45 trainees, some of whom attended an intensive 20 week course in Food Industry Skills:<br/><br/>-  General Knife Skills<br/><br/>-  Food Industry Award in Beef and Pork Butchery Skills &ndash; FDQ/EQF &ndash; Level 3 Award<br/><br/>-  Operative skills &ndash; various operative skills<br/><br/>-  Supervisor Skills &ndash; Beef and Pork Butchery<br/><br/>During 2015 they plan to deliver further knife and technical skills at various levels for member companies and Job Seekers looking to get into the sector. <br/><br/>Food and Drink Industry Ireland (FDII) looked at developing a Knife and Boning Skills Traineeship under the Future Skills Needs Programme (FSNP) with initial training planned to be delivered before the end of 2014. However, the industry requested deferring the programme until 2015 as they explained they did not have the in-house resources to facilitate the programme in Q3 &amp;amp; Q4 2014.  For 2015, FDII they will progress the Knifing and Boning Traineeship as well as offering training in Animal Welfare, Conflict Management, Negotiation Skills, Train the Trainer Skills, MS Excel and HACCP. They are also looking at offering courses in leadership skills for people working in operative roles, all of which will be available to meat producers. Their Steering Group has representation from across the Food and Drink sector, with 3 companies from the meat sector represented.</p></reply>

However, I can advise that the information concerned is held on a County basis and the current status of all projects, including those in County Cork, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this is updated regularly throughout the year.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the 5 year School Plan announced in March 2012, together with the schools announced in June 2013 under the Government's &quot;investment in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package and the schools included in the 2015 construction programme, details the major school projects, including those for County Cork, that will commence construction over the duration of my Department's &euro;2 billion capital investment programme (2012-2016). The primary aim at the core of my Department's construction programme is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. In the case of County Cork, 43 school projects are listed to proceed to tender and construction over the duration of the programme.<br/><br/>For the Deputy's convenience a list is attached containing details of all County Cork major school building projects that have been completed in each of the past four years and the funding allocated in the case of each of these projects. As the Deputy will be aware, all publicly funded projects are subject to public procurement guidelines and a competitive tender process. In that context it is not possible to publish funding allocations until projects are completed.<br/><br/>In addition to these major projects, my Department also approves funding on an on-going basis for devolved projects under the Additional Accommodation Scheme in response to applications from schools for funding to meet an immediate accommodation requirement because of increased enrolments and where an additional teacher is being appointed. In addition, the Deputy will be aware of the funding provided under the Prefab Replacement Initiative to replace prefabs with permanent classroom and resource rooms accommodation.

The standard based craft apprenticeship scheme was designed as a demand driven alternance programme in conjunction with all key stakeholders.  The number of craft apprentices registered with SOLAS is determined by individual employers recruiting potential apprentices within a range of occupational sectors.</p>  <p>  Currently, apprentices must be at least 16 years of age on entry to the existing apprenticeship trades. The entry requirements are set at a minimum of 5 Grade Ds at Junior Certificate or equivalent, or successful completion of an approved pre-apprenticeship course, or at least three years' work experience approved by SOLAS. In practice at least 70% of apprentices registered with SOLAS in 2014 had attained Leaving Certificate standard. Employers often consider criteria beyond the minimum entry requirements and in many apprenticeship programmes the standard of mathematics, science and or technology content has intensified in line with labour market expectations and demands.  Furthermore, the majority of employers are less inclined to recruit apprentices at a relatively young age. For example, only 1% of apprentices registered with SOLAS in 2014 were 16 years of age, 78% of apprentices were 19 years of age and over and 58% were over 20 years of age.</p>  <p>  The recent review of apprenticeship recommended that with respect to the current apprenticeship trades, "the minimum entry levels needed to successfully complete each programme should be reviewed, while ensuring appropriate pre-apprenticeship programmes are made available for those unable to meet the entry requirements." With regard to apprenticeships in new areas, which are expected to be developed following a call for proposals in this regard by the recently established Apprenticeship Council, the Review recommended that "Entry levels may need to be raised to cater adequately for occupations with a high mathematics, science or technology content. However, care should be taken to ensure that opportunities for those with lower skills to progress are not eroded unduly. Entry levels should be set on an occupation by occupation basis."  These recommendations will be borne in mind when examining entry level requirements for apprenticeships into the future.</p>  <p>  With regard to the option of returning to the Leaving Certificate, there are already a significant amount of opportunities for adults to return to education. Over the past few years a range of programmes has been developed to facilitate adults who want to return to education, including programmes leading to the Leaving Certificate examinations. </p></reply>

The Board of Management shall publish the enrolment policy of the school and that policy must be non-discriminatory and applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.  Where new schools are needed, the model of provision is decided by an open patronage determination process, which is overseen by the New Schools Establishment Group. The criteria for awarding patronage place a heavy emphasis on parental choice and diversity of provision. Prospective patrons must also commit to enrolling pupils from the area to be served by the new school.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.</p>  <p>  The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. </p>  <p>  The Constitution provides that legislation providing State aid for schools shall not be such as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school. In this regard, Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), provides that no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student. Therefore, parents have the right, if so desired, to ensure that their children do not receive religious instruction. </p>  <p>  It is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive.

The Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum made a series of recommendations dealing with the creation of more inclusive schools.  The Report took account of the findings and conclusions of previous groups and committees, such as those of the Constitution Review Group of 1996.</p>  <p>  Religious education is one of the seven curricular areas of the 1999 Primary School Curriculum. However, under Article 44 of the Constitution, all parents have the right to withdraw their child from religious instruction in school.  Furthermore, under Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, a student cannot be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student or, in the case of a student who is 18 or more, the student him/herself. The Education (Admission to School) Bill, which is currently being drafted, will require schools to publish an enrolment policy which will clarify the school's arrangements for upholding the constitutional right of parents that their children not attend religious instruction. </p>  <p>  With regard to denominational religious education, the Forum Report did not recommend that religious instruction be removed from the school day. However, the Advisory Group had concerns about the amount of time which can be devoted to sacramental preparation in some schools and they recommended that it should not be allowed to encroach on time allocated for the general curriculum. They also recommended on-going discussion with parents and clergy in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Report also noted that there are currently no non-denominational primary schools, but that there is no objection to the establishment of such schools if sought by a sufficiently large number of parents. The Forum also concluded that the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children have the right to receive Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics and recommended that an ERB and Ethics programme be developed.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is developing a curriculum for ERB and Ethics for all primary schools.</p>  <p>  A follow-up paper to the Forum Report entitled Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions was published on 1 July 2014.  The paper outlines good practice and options for promoting diversity in all schools and encourages school authorities to engage in consultation with stakeholders and to review their policies and practices on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain suitable for the school population that they serve.  It recognises that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context.  It also notes that this is an evolving situation and that practices may evolve over time as circumstances change.</p>  <p>  The paper was informed by a consultation with stakeholders and encourages school authorities to consider their policies and practices and to review whether they are taking the steps necessary to welcome all pupils and make them feel included.</p>  <p>  Particular areas to be examined by schools relate to:</p>  <p>  - The right to opt out of religion classes;</p>  <p>  - Scheduling of Religion Classes and other Religious Activities;</p>  <p>  - Options for Pupils in relation to Religious Ceremonies of the Ethos of the School; </p>  <p>  - Celebration of Religious Festivals; and</p>  <p>  - Display of Religious Artefacts.</p></reply>

While recognising the role that Catholic schools have played in welcoming children from diverse backgrounds and the continuing role for Catholic schools, we have made changes to the patronage system with the model of provision for new schools being reflective of parental demand for the types of schools they want to send their children to.  We are also making progress under the patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government gives a commitment to move towards a more pluralist system of patronage for our schools.  In this context, a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism was established to look at how schools can cater for diversity and ensure an inclusive and respectful environment for all their pupils. Work is continuing on the follow-up to the Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum and its recommendations regarding diversity in society.</p>  <p>  In relation to enrolment policies, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools, whether extant or newly established, to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.</p>  <p>  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p>  <p>  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.

The scale is evidenced by the fact that there were some 5,700 primary schools alone at the foundation of the State and today we have just over 3,000.  It would be necessary to fully analyse all school openings, closures and amalgamations on a year-by year basis and identify school establishment dates, closure dates, patronage details and school address.  Many of the records pre-date computerisation and are in the National Archives Office.  My Department has never assembled information on where individual pupils transferred to when a school closed so this information is not available at all. In regard to teachers in schools that close due to amalgamation, if the teacher does not transfer to the amalgamated school, they may be redeployed. Redeployment details for a teacher are maintained on their personnel record and such records are not organised on the basis of school closures.</p></reply>

In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have siblings in the school.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p>  <p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The Equality legislation provides that any school that has this objective may, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. The legislation provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Government gave approval in March last year for drafting the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2014 and the bill is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.  The objective of the Admissions to School Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p>  <p>  A key objective in designing the framework is to create greater confidence for parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools are legitimate, reasonable and fair.</p></reply>

Such skills are not just confined to particular Leaving Certificate subjects such as in the study of Design Communication and Graphics where it is a core component of learning but such skills are a core component of the students learning experience right across senior cycle.  ICT is seen as a cross curricular tool which enhances the learning experience and is required by students in everyday life.<br/><br/>  At Senior Cycle, the NCCA is currently working on the revision of a significant number of Leaving Certificate subjects, including Leaving Certificate Applied Mathematics.  A background document was out for consultation before Christmas.  It includes suggestions relating to a proposed core and options. <br/><br/>  One of the options for consideration in the consultation paper is the inclusion of &quot;computer programming&quot;.  Submissions have been received and are currently being considered.  The next step is the production of a draft specification for Leaving Certificate Applied Mathematics and this is due by the end of the year for consultation.  The inclusion of the &quot;computer programming&quot; option will form part of the NCCA's deliberations. <br/><br/>  There are no plans currently for the NCCA to design a stand alone subject called Leaving Certificate computer programming. <br/><br/>  I would also note that the rollout of 100mbps high speed broadband to all post primary has been completed since 2014.</p></reply>

As a result of the review, qualification allowances were abolished with effect from 1st February 2012.  Department of Education and Skills Circular 0008/2013 outlines the effect of this decision on teachers. <br/><br/>  In Paragraph 12 of Circular 0008/2013 an exception is made in the case &quot;where as at 5 December 2011, a teacher in employment on that date and eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of the post they held on that date, was actively undertaking a course of further study leading to an additional qualification, provided that the teacher does not cease to be a registered student on that course before its completion.  Such individuals may apply to the Department/VEC (now ETB) as appropriate for a derogation from the general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award.&quot;  Teachers who were not in employment in an Oireachtas funded post on 5 December 2011 and not eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of any teaching post on that date, do not qualify for payment of an allowance in respect of the qualification related to the course being undertaken at that time.<br/><br/>  The issues raised by the Deputy have been brought to the Teachers' Conciliation Council (TCC) by representatives of the teachers concerned and it would therefore not be appropriate to comment further until the issues have been deliberated on by that forum.  The TCC is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers, the purpose of which is to provide a means of dealing with claims and proposals relating to the salaries and terms and conditions of teachers.

The work and conduct of members of my Department's Inspectorate are governed by the principles set out in the Code of Practice for the Inspectorate, which include respectful engagement, responsibility and accountability.  There is a well-established procedure whereby any teacher affected by an inspection may request a review of that inspection.  This procedure facilitates teachers and inspectors to address concerns, complaints and misunderstandings as quickly as possible.  Where an issue arises during a classroom visit, the teacher should raise the matter with the inspector immediately on the conclusion of the classroom visit.

The primary purpose of POD  will be to monitor the education progress of primary pupils (in DES aided  schools), throughout the primary system and onwards to post primary level and  to help them develop their full educational potential. Once up and running  other secondary purposes of POD will include becoming the basis for the  allocation of teachers and capitation grants. Aggregated POD data will also be  used for the production and publication of primary level statistics. A PPS number is an individual's unique identification number for all dealings  with the Public Service, including Social Welfare, tax, education and health services.<br/><br/>Having the PPSN on the database will help ensure that there are no  duplicate records in the system i.e that two schools do not have the same child  on their roll. In the future we will be able to track pupils from early  childhood education, to primary school and onto post-primary, which will allow  us to ensure that every child in the State of compulsory school age is in  education.  Religion is requested for statistical reasons only and parents have  the option not to include the religion of their child on POD. Individualised data coverage has already been in place for a number of years at  pre-primary, post-primary and third level education who collect individual  information on each pupil, including their PPSN.<br/><br/>The current retention policy for Primary Online Database (POD) data is for records to be maintained for the longer of either the period up to the pupil's 30th Birthday or for a period of ten years since the student was last enrolled  in a primary school. In future schools will no longer be required to keep the Cl&aacute;rleabhar therefore POD will be the official register of pupils in schools  and data will be retained to allow pupils to obtain their records in the future. The retention policy facilitates the Department's requirement for audit and accounting purposes as pupil's data is used in the allocation of teaching  posts and funding to schools. The policy also serves to trace retention trends  in the education system, is important for longitudinal research and policy  formation, as well as being an important statistical indicator nationally an  internationally. Aggregate and not individual data is used for the majority of these purposes. The Department will continue to review its retention policy for pupil data in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The Department proposes in the future to share some of the personal data stored on POD with other State bodies. These are: <br/><br/>- Central Statistics Office, under the Statistics Acts to assist with the compilation of national statistics. <br/><br/>- The National Council for Special Education, under the Education Welfare Act, in order to assist in supporting resource allocation in relation to pupils with special educational needs. <br/><br/>- The Child and Family Agency, under the Education Welfare Act, to ensure that each child of compulsory school age is in receipt of an education. <br/><br/>- The Department of Social Protection to validate pupil identity.  The Department will put in place a data user agreement with each of these bodies, which includes the purpose for which the body requires the data, its  storage, security and retention. <br/><br/>  The information on POD will, from the 2016\2017 academic year onwards, be used to underpin the payment of public funds and allocation of resources to primary  schools, as is already the case at pre-primary, post-primary and third level  education. If a child's data is not on POD at that time then they may not be  counted for grant payment and teacher allocation purposes for the child's  school.</p></reply>

In reaching this decision, the Patron and schools had available to them an independent technical report that reviewed the curricular capacity of both school buildings and sites. Whilst deficits of accommodation in both buildings were identified, the report recommended that one of the school buildings was the location that "requires the least amount of re-modelling of the existing structure and has the potential for expansion to accommodate a combined curriculum and additional teaching spaces". The Patron has advised my Department that they accept the report's recommendation.</p>  <p>  To support the amalgamation process, it is understood that a Steering Group is being established that will have nominees of parents, teachers and members of the Boards of Management of both schools. It is also envisaged that from September next, both schools will cooperate closely in terms of curricular provision. The Patron is continuing to engage with my Department in relation to the process including the need for additional accommodation.</p></reply>

The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.</p>  <p>  This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focussed pre-school inspections. It was not possible to also secure the funding which would have been required to change the staffing schedule for primary schools.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p></reply>

They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement that schools report incidents of bullying behaviour to my Department. The procedures however include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.</p>  <p>  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying. Furthermore, the Inspectorate's plan for 2015 provides for collaborative research to be conducted in a sample of primary and post-primary on how schools provide for pupils' wellbeing.

Among them are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, pupil travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities.  I am mindful of the concerns of small schools and will take them into account in considering any planning framework for future provision of schools.  </p></reply>

This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  Furthermore, in the case of noise nuisance being caused by individuals in private rented accommodation, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 imposes minimum statutory obligations on landlords and tenants of private residential tenancies.  Tenant obligations under the Act include an obligation not to engage, or allow visitors to engage, in anti-social behaviour which is defined as including persistent noise that interferes with the peaceful occupation of other dwellings in the neighbourhood.  The Act also imposes an obligation on landlords to enforce the tenant obligations.<br/><br/>A public information leaflet, A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available to view and download on my Department&rsquo;s website:.<br/><br/>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to take further steps to address noise pollution, inter alia , through consideration of the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the-spot fines). The development of new noise legislation by my Department is being considered in the context of this commitment , and this specific issue will be considered as part of this process . However, as indicated in the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme published on 14 January 2015, it is not possible at this time to indicate when such a Bill might be published, having regard to the broad range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department&rsquo;s remit.</p></reply>

Armagh entering the River Fane system which is the source of the drinking water supply for Dundalk.  </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of Irish Water to assess the risk of contamination to public water drinking sources and to monitor any such risks. Monitoring occurs of the source water, the water after treatment and the water at the point of use within the water network and drinking water sample results for 2014 are fully compliant with the Drinking Water Regulations. If the supply becomes contaminated or fails to meet the minimum drinking water quality standards Irish Water must notify the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promptly.  The EPA investigates all such notifications to ensure that remedial action is taken to prevent any reoccurrence. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I understand that Louth County Council, on behalf of Irish Water, has contacted the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland to investigate this specific allegation. </p>  <p>  Lough Muckno is part of the EPA&rsquo;s national Lake Monitoring Programme network under the Water Framework Directive. Biological monitoring is undertaken every 3 years and monitoring of the general physical conditions is undertaken every year with samples analysed for 13 specific parameters.    </p>  <p>  The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts carry a general prohibition on the entry of any polluting matter to waters.  Any persons causing or permitting polluting matter to enter waters is liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;15,000,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both. The primary enforcement responsibility in relation to water pollution rests with local authorities, which are in turn supervised by the EPA for this purpose. Local authorities issue a significant number of enforcement notices every year under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts. These enforcement notices require respondents to carry out actions to prevent or remedy water pollution, and are followed up by prosecutions where necessary.   </p>  <p>  Enforcement in relation to illegal diesel laundering activities is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners from the point of view of avoiding loss of revenue to the Exchequer. My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by the diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment, in particular without risk to water. </p>  <p>  Approximately 1,200 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities since 2008 and to date my Department has reimbursed all of the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis. Almost half of the clean-up operations have taken place in County Louth with 596 incidents having been dealt with at a cost of approximately &euro;4.8 million. </p>  <p>  Following discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and Monaghan County Council who have also been seriously affected by this issue, my Department has agreed to fund a pilot sampling programme for abandoned fuel laundering waste material in order to generate improved intelligence. This exercise may result in linking dump sites to particular laundering processes as well as identifying the origins of the diesel based on the markers detected in the analysed material. The pilot programme will be carried out by a specialised contractor who will visit the sites, sample the waste, deliver these samples to the state laboratory and compile a report based on that analysis. </p>  <p>  My Department, as part of on-going cooperation with the Northern Ireland authorities on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held recent discussions with the relevant Northern Ireland authorities on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are on-going.   </p>  <p>  There is strong end active co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies. However, I will be writing to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight again the problems being faced by border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime and will also raise the issue at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council.   </p>  <p>  I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions. </p></reply>

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent). The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent).  Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.<br/><br/>A total of 2,598 cases had been submitted by the end of December 2014 under the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme. Of these 1,040 were ineligible or terminated during the process, of which 276 cases were not progressed because the household in question was deemed to be over or under accommodated. Agreement on the sale could not be agreed on a further 46 cases. Of the remaining cases submitted, 68 have been completed, 1,002 are currently with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and the remaining 442 are actively being progressed.My Department has issued funding approval in respect of 119 cases. <br/><br/>The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme, which was rolled out nationally in February 2014, allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages. The national roll-out followed a pilot scheme in 2013 under which 18 households were assisted.  In 2014, a further 64 households in distress with local authority mortgage arrears were assisted through the scheme, which continues to operate.<br/><br/>My Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014. Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.</p></reply>

A number of actions arising from the Summit were considered at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 8 December and were then formalised into an Action Plan to Address Homelessness which was noted by the Government at its meeting on 9 December 2014.  A copy of this action plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  Progress in implementing this plan is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and a copy of the most recent progress report is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link provided above.<br/><br/>In addition to those actions which constitute an immediate response to the issue of rough sleeping in Dublin, actions have been identified which tackle the more systemic issues, classified under the three categories of the &lsquo;housing-led&rsquo; approach.  There is enough accommodation available for all those sleeping rough, so that no one needs to sleep rough unless they choose to do so. The number and availability of emergency beds is being monitored closely by Dublin City Council and further beds will be brought on stream should the need arise. <br/><br/>Where a homeless person does not want to be placed in emergency accommodation, the Housing First intake street team will refer the person to the newly established Nite Caf&eacute; which is now fully operational. The Nite Caf&eacute; links in with the new  Transport with support services for those sleeping rough as an integral part of the Housing First service.  This initiative transports homeless persons to emergency accommodation and provides them with the necessary health and care supports in conjunction with other State providers<b>.</b><br/><br/>The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes. In November 2014, I launched the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020. This six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion and restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through, inter alia, a resumption of direct building on a significant scale by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.</p></reply>

As matters stand , the Board has received in the order of 627 completed applications of which some 597 have a Building Condition Assessment with a damage condition rating of 2.  A total of 485 applications have been validated by the Board and forwarded to the Housing Agency for the verification stage; of those 295 have now been approved by the Board for inclusion in the scheme and the applicants have been notified. Applications for dwellings not yet included in the scheme are being processed as quickly as individual circumstances allow.   </p>  <p>  A pilot project involving the remediation of 5 dwellings was completed in the latter half of 2014. I understand that a works contract for 20 houses has recently been awarded and is due to commence shortly while procurement is underway in relation to a further 4 developments involving some 73 dwellings.  In addition, I understand that tenders are due to issue on a further 49 dwellings before the end of this month.  In light of the build-up of projects under the scheme, an allocation of &euro;10 million is being provided for 2015.   </p>  <p>  HomeBond is a private limited company providing structural guarantees for new houses and, since November 2008, the HomeBond Insurance scheme is underwritten by Allianz Insurance. As is the case for any private company, its operations are a matter for its management and Board of Directors.  My Department understands that HomeBond Insurance Services Ltd is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. As a private company, my Department has no role or function in its operations.</p>  <p>  However, in the context of the pyrite remediation scheme, an agreement was concluded between the Pyrite Resolution Board and HomeBond in June 2014 on the type and level of services which HomeBond will provide to the Board.  My Department understands that HomeBond will contribute technical and project management services, under the direction and supervision of the Pyrite Resolution Board and/or the Housing Agency, to the value of &euro;2 million.</p></reply>

That Summit reaffirmed the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. A number of actions arising from the Summit were considered at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 8 December and were then formalised into an <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>which was noted by the Government at its meeting on 9 December 2014. A copy of this action plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .<br/><br/>Progress in implementing this plan is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and a copy of the most recent progress report is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link provided above.<br/><br/>In addition to those actions which constitute an immediate response to the issue of rough sleeping in Dublin, actions have been identified which tackle the more systemic issues, classified under the three categories of the &lsquo;housing-led&rsquo; approach. There is enough accommodation available for all those sleeping rough so that no one needs to sleep rough unless they choose to do so. The number and availability of emergency beds is being monitored closely by Dublin City Council and further beds will be brought on stream should the need arise.<br/><br/>Where a homeless person does not want to be placed in emergency accommodation, the Housing First intake street team will refer the person to the newly established Nite Caf&eacute; which is now fully operational. The Nite Caf&eacute; links in with the new Transport with support services for those sleeping rough as an integral part of the Housing First service. This initiative transports homeless persons to emergency accommodation and provides them with the necessary health and care supports in conjunction with other State providers.<br/><br/>The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes. In November 2014, I launched the Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. This six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion and restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through, inter alia, a resumption of direct building on a significant scale by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.</p></reply>

The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete. Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.

The plan also identifies the need for enabling technologies and infrastructure which would be used across all of these projects.  The local government sector has delivered major improvements in customer service, efficiency and effectiveness over the last number of years. This has been achieved by allowing customers to transact their business online, automating the interactions between local government and other public service organisations and by automating internal business processes to free up more staff to provide front line services.<br/><br/>Local authorities have enabled their customers, be they individual citizens or businesses, to search for information and transact their business online for many years. <br/><br/>Examples of this include  :<br/><br/>- Local Government Portal to show the services available and portals at service level where appropriate,for example, a planning portal,<br/><br/>- Application forms available online,<br/><br/>- Online planning applications, via the Building Control and Management System (BCMS), are available in some local authorities and are being rolled out across all local authorities.

The processes for the appointment of the Chair person and the ordinary Board Member s are set out under sections 105&ndash;107 of the Act and associated regulations. In relation to the position of Chairperson, the appointment is made by Government from candidates selected by an independent statutory selection committee. The composition of this committee is set out under section 105 of the Act and, where a vacancy arises, the committee is required to select a maximum of three suitable candidates from among those who compete in a publicly advertised open competition. The selection committee established for the purpose of the appointment of a Chairperson in accordance with the Act shall consist of: </p>  <p>- the President of the High Court,</p>  <p>- the Cathaoirleach of the General Council of County Councils,</p>  <p>- the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government,</p>  <p>-  the Chairperson of An Taisce  &ndash; the National Trust of Ireland, and other specified parties.</p>  <p>The current Chairperson of the Board was appointed in May 2011 on foot of this process.</p>  <p>  The appointment process for ordinary Board Members, set out in section 106 of the Act, provides that appointments shall be made by the Minister from nominees put forward by four representative panels of nominating bodies prescribed for this purpose.</p>  <p>  The 37 organisations which make up these nominating panels are set out in Article 64 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended. These bodies represent a broad cross-section of interests across society so that potential appointees are drawn from a representative group of people, with diverse backgrounds, with a view to ensuring that a balanced and comprehensive view can be reached on the issues with which the Board is or may be concerned. Each body in each nominating panel is invited to nominate suitable candidates for consideration for appointment to the Board.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Chair person, there are currently eight ordinary members on the Board. In making the appointments of the ordinary Board members, cognisance is taken of the balance of skill sets and expertise required by Board members for the effective discharge of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s complex and wide ranging functions.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current nomination and appointment process for the positions of Chairperson and ordinary Board members is fair and transparent and I have no plans to amend the arrangements at this point in time.</p></reply>

The Commissioner o f Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters. The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.<br/><br/>Local authorities are very aware of the demands placed on the business and commercial sector at this time, as well as the competitiveness issues this gives rise to. Local authorities have a leading role in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones. They are committed to local economic development, and are best placed to meet many of the needs of businesses in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures.<br/><br/>In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Plan for Jobs,</i>my Department requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting ARVs in recent years and they have responded positively in this regard. The average ARV adopted by local authorities nationally has decreased each year since 2010. The new structures of local government, including the establishment of municipal districts, have provided an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis. In 2015 , local authorities have begun the process of harmonisation to cater for differences between ARVs of former towns and of counties. In the harmonisation process ratepayers will not pay any more in 2015 than they did in 2014. Any increase or decrease in rates liability due to harmonisation will be phased in after 2015 over a period of up to 10 years. I am also pleased to note that those local authorities which are not subject to the requirement to harmonise, due to already having one ARV for the whole of their administrative area, have either reduced the ARV for 2015 or kept it the same as 2014.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that analysis of the impact of rates on business costs is limited. What analysis is available concludes that commercial rates represent a small portion of overall business overheads compared to energy, rents, payroll and other inputs. The figures vary from sector to sector but research from Forf&aacute;s, IBEC and local authorities all indicate that commercial rates are, on average, less than 5% of business costs. <br/><br/>I accept that the current rates burden , while not excessive overall , may be unfairly distributed in some cases. The revaluation process currently underway by the Valuation Office is re-balancing rates liabilities to ensure that the rates burden is more equitable and in line with changes in valuations across different classes of properties within counties. </p></reply>

A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at the following link: .<br/><br/>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and a copy of the Quarter 3 2014 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above.<br/><br/>On 4 December 2014, I hosted a special Summit on Homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. A number of actions arising from the Summit were considered at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 8 December and were then formalised into an <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>which was noted by the Government at its meeting on 9 December 2014. A copy of this action plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link provided above. Progress in implementing this plan is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and a copy of the most recent progress report is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link provided above.<br/><br/>In addition to those actions which constitute an immediate response to the issue of rough sleeping in Dublin, actions have been identified which tackle the more systemic issues, classified under the three categories of the &lsquo;housing-led&rsquo; approach. There is enough accommodation available for all those sleeping rough so that no one needs to sleep rough unless they choose to do so. The number and availability of emergency beds is being monitored closely by Dublin City Council and further beds will be brought on stream should the need arise. Where a homeless person does not want to be placed in emergency accommodation, the Housing First intake street team will refer the person to the recently established Nite Caf&eacute; which is now fully operational. The Nite Caf&eacute; links in with the new Transport with support services for those sleeping rough as an integral part of the Housing First service. This initiative transports homeless persons to emergency accommodation and provides them with the necessary health and care supports in conjunction with other State providers.<br/><br/>The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes. In November 2014, I launched the Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. This six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion and restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through, inter alia, a resumption of direct building on a significant scale by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.<br/><br/>Additional funding for homeless services across the country in 2015 will ensure continued progress toward the achievement of the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. My Department is currently considering the appropriate allocation of the 2015 homelessness budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homelessness funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.</p></reply>

LCDP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period. It is being implemented on a transitional basis until March next, pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April next.</p>  <p>  As part of the programme of reform of local government, Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) were established in all local authorities. These Committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis. They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.</p>  <p>  The new SICAP is one of my key priorities and targets a range of groups across communities. In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway. Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got underway on 20th October 2014 and involved the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process. The closing date for receipt of tenders under stage two was noon on 19 December 2014. The tenders received are currently being evaluated and tenderers will be informed of the outcome by mid February.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the procurement process for SICAP was open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the procurement process underway is in line with best practice and that the procurement documentation on e-Tenders contains all the relevant information on the process. I look forward to the outcome of the process and the roll out of SICAP in April 2015.</p>  <p>  All groups who received LCDP funding in 2014 are being funded through LCDP interim arrangements until 31 March next, pending the outcome of the SICAP competitive process.</p></reply>

The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>.<br/><br/>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC) in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period.  However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020 and therefore the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address this particular challenge in the years 2017 to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to be ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. It is also important to note that the Bill will provide for long-term successive planning in this respect.<br/><br/>In terms of the timeframe, the development of the National Mitigation Plan will be an open and inclusive process. It will be necessary therefore to ensure that the Plan will comply with the principles and requirements of E U Directive 2001/42/EC and the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations 2004 to 2011 and t he Appropriate Assessment provisions of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and S.I. No. 477/2011 (European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011). Both of these processes involve a number of phases, including statutory consultative phases at different stages of the development of the plan. In addition to the statutory consultations required under the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment legislation, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill provides that there will be a consultation process on the draft National Mitigation Plan. I propose to allow a significant period of time for the public and stakeholders to express their views and provide input to the continued development of the plan.<br/><br/>The general public and stakeholders have already had opportunities to submit views on the sectoral elements of the planned National Mitigation Plan in previous public participatory processes over the last year or so. In continuing my commitment to openness and inclusiveness, I will shortly be inviting the views of the public and stakeholders on the preparation of the National Mitigation Plan currently being developed and I am particularly looking forward to receiving input from all interested parties on how we might address the specific challenges ahead and what economic opportunities might arise in moving towards a low-carbon sustainable economic future.</p></reply>

The Circular advised on updated practice to be implemented in relation to bonds and securities for housing and other relevant developments, complementing previous circular PD 1/08 on the taking in charge of residential developments generally, including developments involving management companies. My Department has committed to keeping Circular Letter PL 11/2013 under review as required in order to take account of practical experience in the implementation of the guidance concerned. However I have no immediate plans to amend the planning legislation in this regard at this point in time.<br/><br/>Given the increasingly important role of securities in effecting the resolution of public infrastructure elements especially of unfinished housing developments, information has been collated nationally on the level of planning securities, including bonds, held by planning authorities in respect of unfinished housing developments.<br/><br/>Over the past four years, local authorities across the country have obtained more than &euro;43.3 million from such securities to complete essential public infrastructure within housing developments including roads, water services, public lighting and amenity areas and where breaches of planning conditions have occurred.  The yearly breakdown is as follows:<br/><br/>- 2010 - 2011: &euro;23.9 million<br/><br/>- 2012: &euro;3.9 million<br/><br/>- 2013: &euro;2.9 million<br/><br/>- 2014: &euro;12.6 million<br/><br/>In addition, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments. The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.<br/><br/>The management and administration of issues relating to unfinished housing developments, including bonds and securities, is a matter for individual local authorities. Each local authority has appointed an Unfinished Housing Development co-ordinator; contact details can be found at: .</p></reply>

Actions 1 and 4 of the Strategy require the agreement of national targets for delivery of social housing across local authorities in 2015 and in subsequent years.<br/><br/>In 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided, broken down as follows:<br/><br/>- 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies;<br/><br/>- 3,000 units under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative;<br/><br/>- 1,000 vacant local authority units will be returned to use; and,<br/><br/>- 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units.<br/><br/>In addition, a further 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).<br/><br/>Over the following 2 years, 2016 and 2017, I envisage that some 13,500 additional new units will be provided and an extra 20,000 households will also be accommodated through HAP. The Project Board responsible for oversight of the delivery of actions and targets under the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>, and the Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce have each agreed a process on setting social housing delivery targets. Consultation with individual Local Authorities is now taking place.<br/><br/>The Strategy envisages that the standard availability-based design, build, finance and maintain (DBFM) Public Private Partnership (PPP) model will be used as a basis for the delivery of a large-scale social housing investment, delivering social housing units in multiple locations and procured within the same public contract. The model proposed has been used to build a number of national roads and 23 schools in Ireland and is also being used to deliver primary health care centres and a programme of new and refurbished courthouses. This considerable experience will be used to ensure that the housing PPP can deliver significant scale, value for money for the State and a return for investors.<br/><br/>Under the detailed governance arrangements outlined in the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i><font color="#004080">,</font>an Oversight Group, which I Chair, will oversee the delivery of the 37 actions. Action 8 sets a target of delivering 1,500 units via PPP by the end of 2017.<font color="#004080"> </font>The Project Board will ensure that all actions are progressed under the 5 work streams identified in the Strategy. A separate Group has been established to progress the delivery of actions under each work stream. The detailed work on the PPP proposal will be progressed with the benefit of the expertise of the Group responsible for Work Stream 1 - Finance.<br/><br/>In October 2014, I announced major reforms of the planning system as part of the forthcoming Planning and Development (No.1).  The Review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts has been completed. The legislative changes required on foot of the Review have been incorporated into the General Scheme of the Bill which was published in November 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The General Scheme of the Bill is currently the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The Bill is currently being drafted with a view to enactment in 2015.<br/><br/>The new Part V proposals will require developers to provide up to 10% of their housing units for social housing and the legislation will remove the ability of developers to account for their social housing commitments through cash payments to local authorities. The proposals will furthermore ensure that the social housing units will be located predominantly on the site of the original developments. Under these plans, it is estimated that in the region of 4,000 additional social housing units will be delivered through the Part V mechanism by 2020.</p></reply>

The 2014 Act provided for the unification of the city and county councils in Limerick and Waterford and reviews of local government arrangements , recently announced in Cork and Galway , include the option of unification of the city and county councils in those areas.<br/><br/>A new system of sub-county governance in the form of municipal districts was also introduced under the 2014 Act to replace the now dissolved town council formation and achieve stronger, more integrated local government in each county while devolving significant decision-making to elected members at district level.<br/><br/>Within the new sub-county arrangements, specific legal provision has been made to allow Drogheda to retain the title &lsquo;Borough&rsquo; and to continue to use the title of &lsquo;Mayor&rsquo; as an alternative to Cathaoirleach, thereby maintaining appropriate recognition for the history and civic status of the town. Moreover, elected members for the Borough District of Drogheda have a wide range of reserved functions which can be performed in respect of the district. In addition, those same members form part of the combined plenary membership for Louth County Council with responsibility for the discharge of an additional suite of strategic and other reserved functions.<br/><br/>Overall, I am satisfied that Drogheda has a status appropriate to its size and location within Louth County Council and having regard to the structural and other changes that have taken place countrywide under the Action Programme and revised legislation. In the circumstances, I have no proposals to introduce amending legislation to establish a new city authority in Drogheda or elsewhere. Any such proposal would be at variance with the thrust of policy development and implementation work to date which has seen greater streamlining and integration of local government, with the potential for improved subsidiarity, coherence and efficiency resulting in better value for money and service delivery for citizens.</p></reply>

As Minister, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any case being dealt with by a housing authority.<br/><br/>The suite of social housing supports available to assist households is being expanded with the introduction of the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme , under which a housing authority will pay rent up to a maximum limit to the landlord of private rented accommodation sourced by a qualified household and the household will pay an income-related rent contribution to the authority.  The scheme is being piloted by a number of housing authorities, including a pilot in Dublin City and County for certain classes of homeless households, and will continue to be rolled out across the country this year.<br/><br/>Housing authorities make available 2 types of house purchase loan to assist households to purchase their first home: standard annuity loans targeted at lower-income first- time buyers and loans under the Home Choice Loan scheme, which are available to qualifying middle-income first-time buyers. All applicants must complete a housing loan application form which can be downloaded from the relevant local authority&rsquo;s website.  The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009, and the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.

Consultations with unions have taken place from the initial stages of the review and are ongoing. The report, <i>Managing the Delivery of Effective Library Services</i>, identifies the strong staffing structure necessary to deliver the services and provides the commitment to implement this across the country.<br/><br/>The report implements government policy under the new national public library strategy 2013-2017, <i>Opportunities for All</i>.  The development of the national strategy involved wide consultation with library users of all ages and all other public library stakeholders, as well as formal national public consultation. <i>Managing the Delivery of Effective Library Services</i>seeks to establish stronger, more effective and efficient public libraries and deliver better library services to local communities and citizens, with front-line service continuing to be locally focused and people-centred, and presents opportunities for enhanced individual and community support services and engagement, with no detriment to library services. Against that background, and as the policies, priorities and budgets for library services in each local authority remain the responsibility of the elected members, no separate national consultations were undertaken in the development of this report.</p></reply>

The plan details the broad range of measures in place or being planned by a range of departments and agencies with a view to improving energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy. Specific responsibilities within the remit of my Department in this regard include setting energy performance standards under the Building Regulations and promoting energy efficiency in social housing.<br/><br/>Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings requires EU Member States to ensure that all new buildings will be nearly zero-energy by 31 December 2020.The Directive broadly defines a &lsquo;nearly zero-energy building&rsquo; as a building with a high energy performance where the very low amount of energy required should, to a very significant extent, be met by energy from renewable sources, including renewable energy produced on site or nearby.<br/><br/>Against this background, Ireland has been making significant progress in terms of both improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions within the built environment. Taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2007 set the requirements necessary to achieve a 40% improvement (over the 2005 standards) in the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings. The requirements were subsequently upgraded under the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011 which has delivered a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings. One further upgrade of the Part L requirement is envisaged in order to ensure that Ireland meets our 'nearly zero energy' obligation by 2020. A comprehensive public consultation process and a rigorous regulatory impact assessment will be undertaken before such changes are finalised.<br/><br/>My Department also continues to pursue an ongoing programme of investment in improving the energy efficiency of the existing stock of social housing owned by local authorities and has published the best practice design guidelines <i>Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities</i>which, among other things, promote higher standards of energy efficiency in new social housing. Local authorities are undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of my Department, on the least energy efficient social houses over a 3 year period. Funding of &euro;50 million is being provided over the period 2013-2015 for improving the energy performance of older local authority housing stock. This programme will improve energy efficiency and comfort levels, and therefore BER ratings, in 25,000 local authority homes.</p></reply>

These draft revisions proposed:</p>  <p>  - The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,</p>  <p>  - A mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p>  <p>  - The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p>  <p>  A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014. My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this period.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines.</p>  <p>  The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. In the interim, the 2006 Guidelines continue to apply to existing planning applications. Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p>  <p>  I am precluded, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, from exercising any power or control in relation to any individual planning application or appeal with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. It is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination in relation to a planning application or appeal, and my Department has no function in this regard. As indicated, planning authorities must 'have regard' to planning guidelines issued by my Department. However, these are issued for guidance purposes to assist planning authorities in the performance of their functions. Ultimately, planning authorities will make their own decision based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p></reply>

As a State we have ambitious targets for 16% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020 through meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% renewables in transport and 12% in heat.  In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy, equating to 20.9% of electricity demand, 5.7% of heat demand and 2.8% of transport demand.</p>  <p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity.  The total amount of wind generation connected to the grid is approximately 2,200MW.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500MW and 4,000MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.</p>  <p>  With regard to 2030, the October European Council endorsed a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  In addition, an EU target of at least 27% is set for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030, and an indicative target at the EU level of at least 27% is set for improving energy efficiency in 2030 compared to projections of future energy consumption.</p>  <p>  Ireland intends to make a cost-effective, achievable and fair (in terms of effort sharing among Member States) contribution to these high level EU goals.  My Department is overseeing detailed and rigorous energy system and economic modelling to identify the contribution which is appropriate for Ireland taking account of our specific economic circumstances.  This analysis will address issues such as the quantum of additional renewable electricity we should seek to achieve by 2030, the technologies that should be supported in this regard, and the level at which any future supports should be set.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department participates fully in the whole of Government approach to addressing the challenges of climate change and the transition to a low carbon energy system by 2050.  In this regard, my Department is fully engaged with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and all other relevant departments and agencies, in progressing work to produce a National Low Carbon Transition and Mitigation Plan for the purpose of achieving this transition by 2050.</p></reply>

It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2014/2015 is &euro;335.4 million.  This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20/kVA for medium and large customers.</p>  <p>  Tynagh Energy was one of two plants awarded a 10 year contract as a result of a competition run by the CER to provide urgently required capacity to the electricity system.  The purpose of the scheme was to ensure security of supply in the framework of continuous electricity demand growth.  The 10 year contract ends in 2016 and the plant will not receive compensation from the PSO levy for electricity generated after this date.  Having been awarded 15 year contracts to ensure security of supply, the peat plants are also transitioning out of subsidy.  Edenderry Power will be out of subsidy from the end of this year and Lough Ree and West Offaly power plants will be out of subsidy at the end of their contracts in December 2019.</p></reply>

In this regard, while Inland Fisheries Ireland is the Statutory body responsible for the protection, management and conservation of the inland fisheries resource, it is supported in Salmon fisheries assessment by the Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) which includes fisheries scientists from IFI, the Marine Institute, National Parks and Wildlife Service, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, and the Agriculture, Food and Biosciences Institute for Northern Ireland (AFBINI).  Although the scientists are drawn from these agencies, the advice from the SSCS is independent of the parent agencies.</p>  <p>  The SSCS annually carry out an assessment of salmon stocks on a catchment by catchment basis using internationally accepted best scientific practice to ascertain whether conservation limits are being or likely to be attained on an individual river basis.  The SSCS provide advice to IFI, who are responsible for the management and conservation of these stocks.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland that fish counter data and rod/net catch data (in-river or estuarine measures) of salmon abundance are used by the SSCS to provide a primary measure of spawning stocks and attainment of individual river conservation limits.</p>  <p>  With the operation of fisheries restricted to estuaries and rivers, following the Government decision to close mixed stock fisheries at sea from 2007, the SSCS assessment is now focused primarily on estimating individual river returns from catch data, counter data and ranges of rod catch exploitation rates derived from observed values in Irish rivers in recent years.  The catch statistics derived from estuarine commercial fisheries are an important source of quantitative information for the SSCS, particularly in determining the attainment of individual river Conservation Limits.  Following implementation of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme which commenced in 2001, the catch data are derived from the logbook returns of commercial fishermen and recreational anglers.</p>  <p>  Data are available to the SSCS from 32 fish counters for the 2014 &ndash; 2015 assessments, an increase of 11 counters on the 2011 &ndash; 2012 assessment.  Information on juvenile abundance indices derived from electro-fishing surveys carried out annually by IFI is also examined to indicate stock status.  Juvenile abundance data is used primarily where new information has not been available for rod catches where rivers may be closed to exploitation.</p>  <p>  The information set out above is very comprehensive and is collected annually, where available, for all 143 salmon rivers in Ireland.  The SSCS use the most recent five years of data and not a once annual count to forecast the run of salmon in the following year and to formulate advice to IFI on any surplus available over the conservation limit of each individual river.  This is done to take account of any extremes in conditions such as droughts and floods, and to avoid large short-term fluctuations in predicted salmon returns in the annual scientific advice.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where the number of anglers is reduced over recent years, for rivers where rod catch is the primary means of salmon stock assessment, a rod exploitation rate is applied to the reported rod catch for each river.  If the number of anglers has reduced, for example, due to catch and release angling, a lower rod exploitation rate is applied in that instance.</p>  <p>  For the majority of salmon rivers, the reported rod catch is used in conjunction with rod exploitation rates over the previous five years to estimate the size of salmon runs and predict the run in the following year.  Rod exploitation rates used are derived from fish counters where the total salmon run is known and the also percentage of the run that is taken by anglers (i.e. the exploitation rate).</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s wild salmon management regime, including the work of the SSCS, is very well regarded internationally with delegations from a number of countries visiting in recent years to study and learn from our management system now regularly viewed as best international practice.  The management structure is also well regarded within the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO).</p>  <p>  With regard to the survival of salmon after catch and release, a recent study on three Irish rivers (Gargan et al. 2015) has shown that, when conducted using proper guidelines, survival of salmon after C&amp;R can be high.  Opening rivers to C&amp;R angling provides an important tool to assist data collection on salmon stock status while not significantly impacting on salmon survival.</p>  <p>  Currently, rod catches and commercial catches (if a commercial fishery operates) are used to determine the status of salmon stocks on the Barrow, Nore and Suir rivers.  Use of rod catch, in conjunction with a range of exploitation rates, is the primary index of salmon stock status on the great majority of Irish rivers.  IFI are currently investigating the possibility of installing a fish counter on the river Barrow for salmon stock assessment.  This process will depend on locating a suitable site and securing the necessary planning and other relevant permissions.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) was accepted by the EU in 2009 under the EC Regulation (EC No. 1100/2007).  I am advised by IFI that a close link between the management actions in Ireland&rsquo;s EMP and eel-stock targets has been established by implementing a comprehensive monitoring and stock assessment programme.  This will allow for a direct feedback to management based on response of the stock to management actions.</p>  <p>  Each year, eel stocks are assessed in a national monitoring programme.  This involves assessment of juvenile eel (glass eels or elvers), maturing eel (yellow eels) and mature eels on their migration to sea (silver eels).  Monitoring of recruitment is critical to evaluating the overall success of the eel regulation and is required by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for international stock assessment.  This information is also required to assess and model changes in the future eel stocks in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The EMP was reviewed in 2012 with scientific advice from the statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee on Eels (SSCE).  This review included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered.  Full details of the scientific assessment and outputs of the public consultation are available on the IFI web site.</p>  <p>  The actions set out above under the National Eel Monitoring Programme constitute a comprehensive assessment of eel stock status in Ireland and are reported to the EU on a three yearly basis to comply with Irelands obligations under the EC Regulation (EC No. 1100/2007) for the recovery of eel stocks.</p></reply>

The plan outlined the following main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea: <br/><br/>-  a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market,<br/><br/>-  mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations,<br/><br/>-  ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers,<br/><br/>-  improvement of water quality.<br/><br/>The overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).<br/><br/>Based on comprehensive scientific assessment of eel stocks nationally and a review of Ireland&rsquo;s EMP in 2012 it was recommended that the closure of both the commercial and recreational eel fisheries be continued in line with the conservation imperative.  The 2012 review included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered.  Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) web site.  Similar reviews were carried out across EU Member States as the eel stock has radically declined throughout Europe.  The status of the European Eel has also been defined by the United Nations as critically endangered.<br/><br/>While I recognize fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, the review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation informed the decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015.  Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will be reviewed again this year and an opportunity for further consultation with, and submissions from, stakeholders will be advanced at that time.<br/><br/>I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to catch eel so as to contribute to &quot;Trap and Transport&quot; operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the EMP.<br/><br/>The management regime for salmon is reviewed annually for each of Ireland's 143 salmon rivers and is set out via statutory Instrument at the end of each year in respect of the coming year.  The process includes a statutory 30 day consultation period during which all stakeholders have the opportunity to make submissions on the proposals before they are finalised.<br/><br/>The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following a Government decision in 2006 to cease, for conservation reasons, the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery in the sea.  The scheme targeted &euro;25m towards commercial salmon fishermen who were active in the fishery at the time and funding was provided to fishermen for them to permanently cease fishing activity.  A further &euro;5m was directed towards community projects.<br/><br/>The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and was ceased in 2008 and I understand that all funds were expended.<br/><br/>In the current economic circumstances there is no prospect of funding being available for similar initiatives.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. The map can be accessed at . The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State and includes Orchardstown, Co Tipperary. It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will also be delivered through the Government&rsquo;s intervention.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises / home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands in every county in Ireland.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastucture, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>My Department has engaged external advisors to provide legal, economic, technical and financial advice on the various aspects of the Plan over the next two years. The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. The Intervention Strategy will be notified to the European Commission for State Aid clearance. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

The studies are required to take account of environmental (including visual amenity) impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The IEP will comment on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports. </p>  <p>  The Panel was also asked to consider what work it might usefully undertake to establish whether or not there has been parity of treatment between the North South (N/S) project and the Grid West and Grid Link projects in terms of the work undertaken on the N/S project to date, including route-specific studies of overhead and underground options. Having considered and discussed all of the material provided by EirGrid, in July 2014, the Panel provided its unanimous opinion that, in all material respects, what has already been done on the N/S project is compatible with the methodologies now being employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects.</p>  <p>  The N/S project is part of an on-going process which is expected to be subjected to rigorous assessment as part of the planning processes in both jurisdictions (Ireland and Northern Ireland).

Therefore, the draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources, including wood pellets and other biomass. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.</p>  <p>  The uptake of renewable heat is also supported through Part L of the Building Regulations. Furthermore, the planned reviews of these regulations, for buildings other than dwellings, to achieve Nearly Zero Energy Buildings status, are also expected to result in increasing the uptake of renewable heat from a range of sources including biomass.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Homes scheme, operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), provides grants towards improving the energy efficiency of residential heating through upgrades of boilers, heating control upgrades and the installation of solar heating.

Having considered the submissions made, my Department is in the process of finalising a consultation report and resulting revisions that are proposed to the draft Framework. </p>  <p>  Ireland has particularly challenging carbon emissions targets for 2020 and the Government has announced an ambition to radically reduce carbon emissions by 2050. The work undertaken by the Steering Group considered the role of land transport investment in carbon emissions mitigation. </p>  <p>  The draft Framework highlighted the important role that improvements in the planning system and investment in public transport and cycling and walking can play in reducing emissions, particularly in urban areas.</p>  <p>  However, for a significant proportion of car journeys in Ireland such modal shift is not a viable option. A significant change in the carbon emitting profile of the Irish vehicle fleet will be needed, and this is outside of the scope of the funding framework.  Similarly, any measures promoting or marketing modal shift or behavioural change to sustainable transport require current funding. They are therefore also outside of the scope of this particular document, which relates to the capital investment framework, although they are of course an important part of my Department's work more generally.   </p>  <p>  Revisions are being made to the draft Framework in light of the consultation responses which will put greater emphasis on the interaction between transport investment decisions and mitigation of carbon emissions and the revised Framework will be published in due course.</p></reply>

There is no separate allocation for the LIS.  Instead, local authorities may use up to 15% of their initial Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes remains at 20% of the total cost of the project.  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.</p>  <p>  Some local authorities want a ring-fenced LIS allocation for private roads while others prefer to put the funding into public roads.

In addition, two of the members of DAA Board represent Cork, thereby ensuring that issues pertaining to Cork Airport are considered at the highest level.</p>  <p>  The new management structure is now bedded down and Cork Airport, the DAA and the CADC are focusing their efforts on identifying new route markets and developing new services.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have already invested in developing tourism attractions in the region served by the airport and in generating positive publicity for those attractions.  I would encourage Cork Airport to highlight its role as a gateway to the region and to work with stakeholders to develop and market the tourism product.</p></reply>

In the event of a proposed route traversing private land there are a number of options that can be considered by the authority the first being the permissive access model.  This is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level.  It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners.</p>  <p>  As stated above, negotiated permissive access from the perspectives of cost and public ownership has value but, for projects of national scale, consideration must  be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land and involve major state investment it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.</p>  <p>  While I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided on. There is no one size fits all approach to this.</p></reply>

There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS. Policy in this regard is primarily a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection. </p>  <p>  Section 50 of the Pensions Act was amended in 2013 by the Oireachtas to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme facing funding difficulties. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the trustees of the scheme, who are required under trust law to act in the best interest of all scheme members, to determine how the relevant provisions in the Pensions Acts might be applied to address a scheme's funding problems.</p>  <p>  The proposal from the IASS trustee was approved by the Pensions Authority and was implemented on 31 December 2014. The IASS trustee has confirmed that these measures are in the overall best interest of the members of the IASS as a whole and are fully compliant with National and EU law.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties these necessary changes cause for many scheme members, but the risks that would have arisen for all members, the companies involved and the wider economy if this solution had not been implemented were even greater.</p></reply>

The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is of course the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. It is a matter for local authorities to manage coastal protection works including those affecting coastal roads, in line with resources and in conjunction with national policy by the OPW.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the maintenance and renewal of rail infrastructure under the Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract (IMMAC). A total of &euro;116m has been allocated for 2015 and it is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to prioritise the funding allocations, depending on a range of risk factors such, as inter alia, the type of asset, the condition of the asset, usage of the asset, or the location of the asset. </p>  <p>  In 2014, my Department was retrospectively allocated &euro;16.2m for local authorities to assist in the repair of damaged regional and local roads following the storms of 13 December 2013 - 6 January 2014.  A total of &euro;7m in retrospective funding was allocated last year to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the damages arising in the same period. </p>  <p>  Apart from carry over of &euro;2.1 million into 2015 (from the &euro;16.2 million referred to above) no further commitments have been given to my Department for funding to protect against the effects of severe weather or in respect of coastal infrastructure.</p></reply>

My response to the Topical Issues Debate of 15 January last dealt with the topic raised, which was the use of 'scrambler bikes in public spaces&rsquo;. My response would have been more expansive if I had known the full interest of the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation applies to the use of mechanically propelled vehicles in a public place and the Garda&iacute; have responsibility for the enforcement of this legislation. For the purposes of road traffic legislation, a 'public place' means any public road, and any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge. </p>  <p>  While this includes car parks and the road leading to them in public parks, it does not include parts of a park where mechanically propelled vehicles are not allowed to operate. The rules governing such places are generally contained in bye-laws made by the relevant local authorities and I note in this case that Dublin City Council point out that their bye-laws specifically state that vehicles such as motorbikes and scramblers are not permitted in parks, albeit that the Council said it had difficulty enforcing this.</p>  <p>  It remains the position, however, that responsibility for public parks, including enforcement of the applicable bye-laws, is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p></reply>
