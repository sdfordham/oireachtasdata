The Council has changed the way it works with fewer plenary meetings, greater use of working or project groups, and more structured engagements with key policy actors, interests, and commentators.  </p><p>The NESC has played an important role over many decades in developing shared understanding between Government and other stakeholders on economic and social policy and, more recently, sustainable development.  </p><p>Over the coming years, Ireland faces into a period of significant change both at home and abroad which will present some new and exceptional challenges. The Programme for Partnership Government specifically notes that there are policy challenges where long term thinking is required. </p><p>I expect the Council to continue to contribute to policy development, with a focus on the strategic and longer term view.</p><p>The Council published its most recent report on 25 October &ndash; &ldquo;Moving Towards the Circular Economy in Ireland&rdquo;.</p><p>The Council has also approved a work programme up to 2019 comprising three themes:</p><blockquote>a) A Key Social Challenge: Low Work Intensity Households, Quality Tailored Services and Participation; <br /><br />b) Climate Change: Governance of the Low-Carbon Transition; <br /><br />c) Land Value, Land Use and Urban Development.</blockquote><p>Work on each of these themes is progressing and will be reviewed at the forthcoming Council meetings. </p><p>As is normal practice, I will submit the Council&rsquo;s reports to Government for information before they are published.</p></reply>

Such schemes provide a valuable service to local communities, while at the same time, providing training and educational opportunities to job seekers.The total expenditure for CE in 2016 was just over &euro;361 million. A breakdown of this CE expenditure, for each county, is set out in the table attached. At the end of September, there were just over 21,000 participants on the Programme and over 1,300 supervisors.The annual budget provided to CE schemes includes an amount to cover the cost of training, materials, participant and supervisor wages, which are necessary for the effective operation of the scheme. The materials grant is available towards the cost of all materials necessary for the effective operation of the project such as insurance, audit fees and protective clothing. All scheme expenditure is approved by my Department, at Divisional level, in line with the contract agreement. </p><p>While my Department is not in a position to allocate additional places or monies to the overall budget in 2017, if there is a scheme that has an identified need for additional places or is experiencing financial difficulties, the sponsor should contact their local DEASP Division and the matter will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>The overall number of employment scheme places available in 2017 is 32,000. CE continues to be the largest programme in 2017 with 22,400 places available in over 950 schemes across the country. The balance is made up of placements in schemes such as the Rural Social Scheme and T&uacute;s. </p><p>The Government is very conscious of the role CE schemes play to support the delivery of vital services in local communities.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p><p><b><i>Community Employment Expenditure by County in 2016</i></b><table><tr><th>County </th><th>Wages </th><th>Supervision </th><th>Training </th><th>Materials </th><th>Totals </th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW </td><td>5,892,198 </td><td>987,213 </td><td>162,975 </td><td>315,363 </td><td>7,357,749 </td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN </td><td>4,628,106 </td><td>760,583 </td><td>120,428 </td><td>211,348 </td><td>5,720,464 </td></tr><tr><td>CLARE </td><td>6,751,468 </td><td>1,393,042 </td><td>126,352 </td><td>356,484 </td><td>8,627,346 </td></tr><tr><td>CORK </td><td>25,575,102 </td><td>4,588,449 </td><td>570,816 </td><td>1,372,011 </td><td>32,106,378 </td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL </td><td>13,775,665 </td><td>2,469,327 </td><td>292,956 </td><td>687,693 </td><td>17,225,642 </td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN </td><td>66,174,906 </td><td>14,601,494 </td><td>1,070,408 </td><td>2,475,360 </td><td>84,322,169 </td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY </td><td>18,190,160 </td><td>3,636,502 </td><td>322,442 </td><td>887,631 </td><td>23,036,736 </td></tr><tr><td>KERRY </td><td>12,488,621 </td><td>2,128,569 </td><td>186,009 </td><td>708,588 </td><td>15,511,787 </td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE </td><td>9,974,386 </td><td>1,689,451 </td><td>324,739 </td><td>500,815 </td><td>12,489,391 </td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY </td><td>5,660,880 </td><td>909,030 </td><td>106,265 </td><td>285,090 </td><td>6,961,265 </td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS </td><td>4,188,801 </td><td>695,407 </td><td>60,004 </td><td>202,391 </td><td>5,146,602 </td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM </td><td>1,579,201 </td><td>310,894 </td><td>48,291 </td><td>79,506 </td><td>2,017,893 </td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK </td><td>16,039,202 </td><td>2,995,706 </td><td>258,629 </td><td>782,244 </td><td>20,075,780 </td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD </td><td>5,196,767 </td><td>921,401 </td><td>137,511 </td><td>260,546 </td><td>6,516,226 </td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH </td><td>9,609,997 </td><td>1,543,068 </td><td>228,552 </td><td>483,318 </td><td>11,864,935 </td></tr><tr><td>MAYO </td><td>9,201,648 </td><td>1,828,943 </td><td>163,648 </td><td>472,072 </td><td>11,666,311 </td></tr><tr><td>MEATH </td><td>5,688,388 </td><td>1,005,089 </td><td>149,449 </td><td>284,155 </td><td>7,127,081 </td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN </td><td>4,240,865 </td><td>599,613 </td><td>112,596 </td><td>196,106 </td><td>5,149,181 </td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY </td><td>5,077,853 </td><td>878,142 </td><td>141,937 </td><td>250,460 </td><td>6,348,393 </td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON </td><td>4,193,349 </td><td>838,192 </td><td>95,760 </td><td>196,681 </td><td>5,323,983 </td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO </td><td>5,989,938 </td><td>1,150,102 </td><td>149,932 </td><td>322,144 </td><td>7,612,117 </td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY </td><td>9,657,083 </td><td>2,169,773 </td><td>147,550 </td><td>519,340 </td><td>12,493,746 </td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD </td><td>11,688,276 </td><td>2,144,048 </td><td>242,688 </td><td>588,715 </td><td>14,663,728 </td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH </td><td>6,610,318 </td><td>1,135,842 </td><td>173,487 </td><td>365,683 </td><td>8,285,330 </td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD </td><td>13,293,621 </td><td>2,469,110 </td><td>301,142 </td><td>728,118 </td><td>16,791,992 </td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW </td><td>5,681,601 </td><td>1,021,734 </td><td>154,667 </td><td>286,676 </td><td>7,144,678 </td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total </td><td>287,048,401 </td><td>54,870,726 </td><td>5,849,234 </td><td>13,818,540 </td><td>361,586,901 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-29a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900068#WRA01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 44, 45 and 48 together.</p>  <p>  The current rate bands applying to the State pension contributory were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that, to revert to the previous bands from January 2018, this would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million each following year.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were particularly affected by anomalies under the yearly average system, particularly those with homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will bring these options to the relevant Cabinet Committee before bringing any final proposals to Cabinet.</p>  <p>  Any change would, if of any substance, have a significant cost, and the resources would have to come from somewhere.  It is unlikely this could be done before Budget 2019, and this would reduce the funds available to increase rates of payment in that Budget for everyone, including widows and non-contributory pensioners, neither of whom would gain from any such measure.</p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.  This will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  </p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-29a.39.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900068#WRA03000"><p>There are two State pensions.  Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for that pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.    The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension. </p>  <p>  Backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 is estimated to cost &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise annually and at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions. </p>  <p>  It is clear that this is a very substantial sum, which would not be affordable without very significant cut-backs in other areas.  Therefore, a change where everyone affected by the 1994 cut-off point for the Homemakers scheme would receive a maximum rate pension, is not a feasible option at the present time. </p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate. </p>  <p>  I plan to introduce a total contributions approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory) to replace the yearly average approach from around 2020.  The position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform. </p>  <p>  Separately, I have committed in this House to ask my officials to carefully examine approaches that might assist some women in the situation you refer to, particularly if they were impacted upon by the rate-band changes in 2012.  When they report to me, I will consider the options available, and bring the matter to cabinet committee for consideration and thereafter to Government for approval. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Claims continue to be subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied, including the requirement that 520 contributions be paid.Foster parents are entitled to the benefits of the homemakers scheme, on the same basis as other homemakers, and will qualify if the carer is in receipt of Child Benefit.  If the foster parent is not in receipt of Child Benefit, they can still qualify for the home-makers scheme if the caring periods are confirmed by TUSLA - these are cases where caring is for a short period of time.     The scheme is limited to the age of 12 (except where the child is incapacitated), and most children over that age will be in secondary school until mid-afternoon.

The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained. Instead, the rates for people who both had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EEU countries.</p>  <p>  On the matter of differing criteria for people who retired before and after this change was made, this is the norm, both in Ireland and in other countries, when pension systems are reformed in a way to make them more sustainable.  If it were not the case, either (a) existing pensioners would be subject to actual reductions in their incomes, in some cases several years after reaching pension age, or (b) no reforms which made savings could ever be made, as people would always be subject to the rules in place when older pensioners had reached pension age.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the ratebands not been amended in 2012. If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were affected by the yearly average system, particularly those who had homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will present the possible solution(s) to cabinet committee to consider how these might be financed and thereafter I will bring to Government for approval. </p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.  This will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  </p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.  </p></reply>

This position has not changed. The legislation does not confer a statutory right or entitlement to ENPs.

First, that it should ensure that work pays, and second, that it should have a positive effect on reducing child poverty.  To advance the commitment contained in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Department established an internal working group and an Inter-Departmental Group of the relevant Government Departments to consider proposals.  The Department also issued a call for submissions from interested parties. As part of this process the Department carried out an extensive analysis of the range of supports it provides to assist individuals to take up employment.  This analysis showed the existing in-work supports are very effective, and work well in assisting individuals make the transition from unemployment into employment.    These findings are confirmed by the ESRI&rsquo;s research into the Department&rsquo;s existing in-work measures, and Eurostat figures, which show that the parental in-work poverty rate in Ireland is 5.8%, significantly below the EU 28 average of 11.2%.  </p>  <p>  This is in large part due to the Department&rsquo;s in-work supports such as Family Income Supplement and the Back to Work Family Dividend.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s approach, my approach and that of my predecessor to the working family payment is guided by two principles: first, that we have to ensure that work pays and that it is worthwhile for people to go out to work, and, second, that it should have a positive impact on reducing child poverty in the country, which is still far too high. This is of particular importance to me. </p>  <p>  It is not, for me, as simple as changing the name from Family Income Supplement to Working Family Payment. Under Section 8 I am proposing to put FIS under the umbrella of working family payments and I plan to bring forward a number of progressive supports for working families with a view to assisting those who are transitioning from unemployment into employment, and from under-employment into full employment.</p>  <p>   In the context of Budget 2018 it was decided to re-designate the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme as the Working Family Payment (WFP), which will bring it more visibility as a payment aimed specifically at working families.  The new name better reflects the nature of the payment and the Department would encourage families to look into seeing if they are eligible for the payment.  It is also intended to continually review the package of supports offered to working parents to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives. </p></reply>

It sets out to secure an Irish society in which people with disabilities enjoy equal rights and opportunities to participate in social and cultural life, can take up work if they want to, and have choice and control over how they live their lives. </p>  <p>  The Strategy sets out 114 actions under a range of cross-cutting themes and objectives. These include ensuring that public services are accessible to all citizens; enabling people with disabilities to have an opportunity to work and have a career; providing people who acquire a disability with the supports that they need to remain in or return to work if they so choose, and; developing approaches to ensure people with disabilities are financially better-off in work. A number of these actions are also reflected in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities and the Make Work Pay report, both of which seek to improve employment participation and outcomes for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The NDIS adopts a cross-governmental approach in which Government departments and agencies collaborate with organisations in the disability sector to ensure that the lives of people with disabilities are improved in both a practical and real sense. The role of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is defined both in terms of delivering a number of specific, identified actions in the strategy, as well as being part of the wider cross-governmental implementation of the strategy. The Department is assigned direct responsibility for six actions, mainly reflecting its role in employment and income supports for persons with a disability as well as a number of other actions in common with other departments. The Department also participates in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group (NDISSG) which monitors the implementation of the strategy and which includes the National Disability Authority, the Disability Stakeholders Group and key Government departments. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This year, the cost is &euro;7.3 billion.  This is estimated to increase by &euro;1 billion every five years due to the increased number of pensioners.  These projections mean that there are considerable sustainability and affordability challenges in the years ahead and we must continue to address them. </p><p>There are two State pensions.  Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund. </p><p>Accordingly, it is important to ensure that those qualifying for that pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. </p><p>In 2012 rate bands were introduced which more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place prior to then.  It must be noted that people with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% contributory pension, or a non-contributory pension of up to 95% that of the maximum contributory rate, subject to their means. </p><p>Reverting to the pre-2012 bands would move additional resources to people who already have means, and it is estimated that it would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year. </p><p>It is my intention to introduce a Total Contributions Approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory) from 2020 onwards and I&rsquo;ll be bringing forward proposals in this regard in the near future. </p><p>In the meantime, I have asked my officials to carefully examine approaches that may help to address the issue in relation to the averaging approach as it affects people with a short work period early in their career followed by a long break.  We need to ensure that any proposed approach does not cause further anomalies or disadvantages to arise.  We also need to determine, as best we can, the cost of any such approach and how that can be financed in the future.  When they report to me, I will consider the options available, and bring the matter to cabinet committee and thereafter to Government for approval.</p><p>I want to ensure that any approach taken is fair and sustainable in the long term. </p><p>I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2016 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 24.1 weeks in 2016 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 17.6 weeks in 2016.  I understand from the Chief Appeals Officer that there has been a slight increase in processing times in 2017 with oral hearings taking, on average, 26 weeks and summary decisions taking 20 weeks to finalise.  A number of factors have contributed to the increase including the retirement of six experienced Appeals Officers during the first half of 2017.  However, she is hopeful that processing times will improve as a number of newly appointed Officers gain experience in their roles.Specific actions taken to reduce processing times include: liaising with HR to ensure that vacancies are filled quickly; ensuring that training is given to new Appeals Officers as early as possible; working with the Department to reduce time in submitting appeal files; and a restructuring of the mechanism for recording appeal decisions.</p><p>It is open to an appellant to claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal if their means are insufficient to meet their needs. </p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that processing times are a priority.  However, the drive for efficiency must be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent and of high quality. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 01 January 2017- 31 October 2017</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>13.4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension </td><td>20.4</td><td>24.4</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>21.3</td><td>23.7</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>16.3</td><td>21.2</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>22.3</td><td>32.1</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>18.4</td><td>23.4</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>27.3</td><td>30.3</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>35.1</td><td>28.1</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>26.0</td><td>32.6</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wifes Benefit</td><td>13.1</td><td>15.7</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>21.0</td><td>25.7</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>15.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Death Benefit (Pension)</td><td>102.10</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>19.6</td><td>33.5</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>16.1</td><td>23.8</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>18.8</td><td>24.1</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>18.8</td><td>19.4</td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td>22.7</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>25.2</td><td>34.8</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>30.7</td><td>46.9</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>25.3</td><td>34.1</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>81.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>19.5</td><td>26.4</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>24.9</td><td>28.8</td></tr><tr><td>Medical Care</td><td>-</td><td>27.3</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>54.2</td><td>37.2</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td>25.3</td><td>25.1</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td>15.2</td><td>23.4</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>19.1</td><td>26.8</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>17.4</td><td>24.7</td></tr><tr><td>BTW Family Dividend</td><td>19.9</td><td>27.5</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td>22.5</td><td>24.7</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp;

Parents, whether married or not, are responsible for the maintenance of their dependent children. Part 12 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended, reinforces these civil provisions. In cases where the family unit has broken down, these obligations continue to apply and relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either directly or through the Department of Justice and Equality supports like the Family Mediation Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts. The arrangement of maintenance is therefore a matter between both parents regardless of whether or not either parent is in receipt of a social welfare payment.   </p>  <p>  I have no information that suggests that lone parents are being forced through rigorous court proceedings to seek child maintenance.  </p></reply>

In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance (including smallholders) and pre-retirement allowance, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S PRSI for self-employed workers.</p>  <p>  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid Class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions.  Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to amend legislation regarding the State pension (contributory), to award a maximum rate payment to pensioners who had such a period during 1999-2006 when they were exempt from PRSI.</p>  <p>  However, a person aged over 66 with limited PRSI contributions over the course of their life may claim a State pension (non-contributory) if they have an income need, and this entitlement is not based on payment of social insurance contributions.  The maximum weekly rate is &euro;227, i.e. over 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.

The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.2% by mid-2017.  Numbers at work have increased from 1.836 million in Q2 2012 to 2.063 million in Q2 2017, an increase of 227,000 persons.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from 19.0% to 8.1% over the same period, and numbers in employment have increased by 29,000 to 214,900.While data from the QNHS are not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.    Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in the 5 years to October 2017, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to October 2017, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1741 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with the national trend.</p>  <p>  Regional QNHS data show increases in employment in the high technology sectors in the South East.  Employment in the information and communications sector grew by 50% in the five years up to Q4 2016 compared to 13% nationally.  Likewise the professional, scientific and technical activities sector 90%, compared to 19% nationally. </p>  <p>  These figures indicate that the county has shared in the overall national recovery both in terms of unemployment and the level and quality of employment. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  The policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the region in the last two years.</p>  <p>  Second, through Pathways to Work we ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, the employment service and activation supports provided by my Department are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.</p>  <p>  To date, as I have said, these policies have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford.  I am confident that they will continue to do so.  </p></reply>

Following the publication my Department undertook nationwide consultation workshops with key Community Employment (CE) scheme stakeholders during May and early June. The consultation was very positive and following the workshops new changes to CE conditions were implemented from 3rd July 2017. The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme.These changes include reducing the general qualifying age for CE, for those on the live register, from 25 to 21 years. It addition it is now easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 is disregarded. From July all participants between 21 and 55 years are entitled to one year on the programme and this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment. Furthermore all CE participants age 55 and over can now avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme. There is an overall lifetime limit of 6 years from 2007 (or 7 years if on a disability payment) on CE. </p><p>The roll-out of the &lsquo;two strand approach&rsquo; of activation and social inclusion in terms of how places are categorised is also being progressed. This approach recognised that not all CE places are the same &ndash; some places are providing an opportunity for those who are very distant from the labour market and but interested in working and delivering services in their local community. </p><p>Other places are more directly related to employment opportunities with participants achieving a higher level of award and more labour market relevant work experience. The target progression rate for activation places is set at 50%, given their closer links to job opportunities, while the target progression rate for social inclusion places is set at 20%. In terms of measuring the performance of CE schemes in terms of the progression of participants from both activation and social inclusion places regard for local labour market conditions and the training and education opportunities available. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy  .</p></reply>

The proposals provide for -i)  the introduction of a time limit for submitting funding proposals and for the annual preparation and submission of actuarial funding certificates;ii)  the introduction of a minimum notice period when an employer decides to cease contributions to a scheme; and</p><p>iii)  the Pensions Authority to direct payment of a funding obligation payable by the employer to the trustees of the scheme where a scheme is in deficit and the sponsoring employer has failed to adequately support the scheme to address the funding deficit. </p><p>The amendments will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will encourage employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p><p>Taken collectively, the amendments to the Pensions Act seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The amendments are designed to ensure the sustainability of DB schemes for scheme members and continued trust in the pensions system as a whole.</p><p>Given the technical and complex nature of the provisions in the General Scheme, including the pension provisions, there was not adequate time to include all of these measures in the text of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.

It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028. It also discontinued the State Pension (transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014. As the State Pension (transition) could only be paid if the recipient had retired, and given such a criterion does not apply to the State pension (contributory), this removed a significant disincentive to those who did not wish to retire at State pension age. The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the terms and conditions of employment and pensions of public servants, including the age at which they may be required to retire. I am informed by that Department that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect individual public servants reflect their particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.   </p>  <p>  An interdepartmental group on fuller working lives was chaired last year by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to consider policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors and it reported in August 2016. Any question regarding the work of that group, and the retirement age of public servants, should be addressed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   </p></reply>

The objective of this reform plan will be to provide for a fit for purpose pension system for the coming decades.  Perhaps the most fundamental reform contained within the plan will be confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop and introduce a new automatic enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.  The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is 47% of the working population and this reduces to 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Without reform, it is evident that there will not be the increase in savings necessary to ensure that many current workers avoid significant reductions in their living standards at retirement.   Automatic enrolment will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation for retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security and independence of future retirees and furthermore improve the sustainability of our wider pensions system.  </p>  <p>  Following publication of the reform plan, it is intended that in quarter 1 of 2018 an automatic enrolment policy paper will be published to act as a basis for a public consultation process. Government&rsquo;s intention is to see first enrolments to the new system by 2021.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2016 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 24.1 weeks in 2016 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 17.6 weeks in 2016.  I understand from the Chief Appeals Officer that there has been a slight increase in processing times in 2017 with oral hearings taking, on average, 26 weeks and summary decisions taking 20 weeks to finalise.  A number of factors have contributed to the increase including the retirement of six experienced Appeals Officers during the first half of 2017.  However, she is hopeful that processing times will improve as a number of newly appointed Officers gain experience in their roles.   Specific actions taken to reduce processing times include: liaising with HR to ensure that vacancies are filled quickly; ensuring that training is given to new Appeals Officers as early as possible; working with the Department to reduce time in submitting appeal files; and a restructuring of the mechanism for recording appeal decisions.</p>  <p>  It is open to an appellant to claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal if their means are insufficient to meet their needs. </p>  <p>  The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that processing times are a priority.  However, the drive for efficiency must be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent and of high quality.   </p></reply>

ICS goes a long way to meet the concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interests that had arisen under ISDS.</p>  <p>  The ICS system is composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules and operating on similar principles to the WTO Appellate Body, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings. The ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal is precisely defined and limited to cases such as targeted discrimination on the base of gender, race or religion, nationality, expropriation without compensation, or denial of justice. Forum&ndash;shopping (i.e. seeking to select from a number of different options the option perceived to most likely offer the most favourable outcome) will not be possible. Claims deemed to be frivolous will be dismissed quickly, and multiple and parallel proceedings will be avoided.</p>  <p>  The implications of the ICS for Ireland are viewed as positive as they bring greater clarity to Irish business, especially SMEs, on the modalities of an open and transparent dispute resolution system as well as confirming that a State can never be forced to change legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where the investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly.</p>  <p>  The aim of the European Commission is to establish a Multilateral Investment Court, modelled on arbitrator panels currently operating under the WTO, and other Investment Tribunals.  It will build on the EU's approach on its bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and be a major departure from the system of investor-to-State dispute settlement (ISDS) based on ad hoc commercial arbitration.  The recently concluded EU-Canada trade agreement - CETA - and the EU-Vietnam trade agreement both contain a reference to the establishment of a permanent multilateral investment court. Work continues at EU level on this matter.  </p>  <p>  In the context of a possible EU-UK Free Trade Agreement, which is the stated objective of the UK Government, it is far too early in the Brexit negotiation process to know what the precise trading relationship will be.  In that regard, Ireland will, in due course, be advocating for as comprehensive a trading relationship as possible and this should include appropriate governance and implementation mechanisms.</p></reply>

Of the 39 Brexit-related posts, which includes providing assistance to the Local Enterprise Offices, 34 have been filled to date and 5 are currently under active recruitment.  It is anticipated that the remaining posts will be filled by year end. The breakdown by grade of the additional staff recruited so far is as follows: </p><p>- Level F x 1</p><p>- Level E x 27 </p><p>- Level D x 5 </p><p>- Level C x 1 </p><p>The average annual pay costs of the Level E and F posts combined are &euro;82,700 per post. The average annual pay costs of the Level D and C posts combined are &euro;54,200 per annum. Some of the posts involved are based overseas and the associated salary costs for international posts will vary based on the job market in each particular country.  </p><p>The full-year pay costs, inclusive of employers RSI contributions, associated with the 34 staff already recruited would therefore be in the region of &euro;2.64 million. Enterprise Ireland is utilising Own Resource Income to supplement its Pay requirements to cover its overall staffing cohort.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s pay budget this year included an additional &euro;750,000 to support the immediate requirement for an additional client-facing posts. These additional staff are supplementing existing IDA staff numbers in the context of the extra workload associated with Brexit and are also assisting the Authority in capitalising on Brexit opportunities that may arise. </p><p>Nine additional posts have been filled to date and the annual costs, inclusive of employers RSI contributions, are broken down as follows: </p><p>- 3 x Level E at approximately &euro;72,000 per post. </p><p>- 5 x Level D at approximately &euro;45,000 per post.</p><p>- 1 x Level C at approximately &euro;26,000.</p><p>The full-year pay costs associated with these staff would therefore be in the region of &euro;470,000 per annum. </p><p>A further additional &euro;3 million in Pay was secured by the Department in &ldquo;Budget 2018&rdquo; for next year to further assist with our Brexit response. Of this Enterprise Ireland is being provided with an additional &euro;1.3 million and IDA Ireland an additional &euro;700,000 to recruit additional Brexit related staff. This should enable the Agencies to recruit a further 25 ~ 30 additional staff during 2018. The specific pay allocations for my Department, Offices and Agencies will be finalised and published in the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume during December. </p></reply>

The Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses. </p>  <p>  The Exchequer cost of the Brexit Loan Scheme will be &euro;23 million, with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation contributing &euro;14 million and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contributing &euro;9 million. The combined &euro;23 million will be used by the SBCI to leverage the &euro;300 million to be offered to SMEs through the Brexit Loan Scheme.</p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million fund is underpinned by a counter-guarantee from the European Commission and EIB Group through its InnovFin Loan Guarantee Scheme, which is an important factor when assessing both the cost of the Scheme and the risk to the Exchequer. There is no additional capacity under the existing terms of the counter-guarantee scheme which has been agreed with InnovFin.  The cost of an increase in the size of the Scheme would depend on a number of factors, including whether, and at what terms, increased capacity under the counter-guarantee could be agreed.</p></reply>

Specifically, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Enterprise Ireland was in contact with each of its client companies that export to the UK. As a result, Enterprise Ireland knows, in detail, the level of their clients&rsquo; exposure to Brexit associated risks.    </p>  <p>  In March 2017 EI published its international events programme for 2017 to support Irish exporters which lists 145 events scheduled in Ireland and overseas to include 46 international trade visits with focus on market diversification into Eurozone and North America. Enterprise Ireland has also launched a &lsquo;Global Ambition Campaign&rsquo; which is a communications campaign to promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers. Enterprise Ireland also launched a new strategy to increase exports to the Eurozone by 50 per cent (&euro;2 billion) by 2020 &ndash; this is a key response to any potential barriers which may adversely impact trade with the UK.    </p>  <p>  Also in March, 2017, EI&rsquo;s 'PrepareforBrexit' communications campaign featuring the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; (on www.prepareforbrexit.ie) was launched. The &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. The Scorecard uses a short diagnostic to generate a report scoring SME performance across a range of metrics against best practice. This can then be used to direct firms towards relevant schemes, programmes or other forms of assistance.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage one-to-one on a regular basis with clients to support their preparations for Brexit and will promote increased awareness and preparation across the economy for the various challenges posed by Brexit through the Brexit Scorecard. As set out in the Department&rsquo;s strategy, Enterprise Ireland will develop stabilisation options to ensure, where necessary, that larger, strategically important companies that are viable but vulnerable can make the necessary investment to overcome the challenges of Brexit. Enterprise Ireland will continue to support companies to maintain and grow opportunities in the UK market, while, at the same time, supporting companies to grow market opportunities in the Single Market, and in particular in the Eurozone. </p>  <p>  Looking to the medium to longer term, Enterprise Ireland will continue to support companies in terms of innovation, competitiveness, management and financial capability to become more resilient in international markets and to be competitive with other economies.</p>  <p>  I should also add that work is progressing on a proposed Brexit-related Working Capital Guarantee Scheme and the scoping out of the need for a longer term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in investing for a post-Brexit environment.</p></reply>

The Programme is designed to facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutions to produce world class research in key strategic areas including bioscience/biomedical; medical technologies; energy, environment and marine; food and drink; social sciences and humanities; ICT and advanced communications and; platform technologies and materials.</p><p>The PRTLI has supported the provision of top-class research infrastructure (buildings, laboratories and cutting edge equipment) as well as human capital development, through Structured PhD/Emergent Technology programmes across Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes (HEIs).  My Department took over responsibility for the PRTLI in May 2010, from the Department of Education and Skills. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) continues to administer Cycle 5 of the Programme on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The allocations and amounts expended on the PRTLI in the years 2010 &ndash; 2017 are set out in Table A below. The full amount allocated in the Department&rsquo;s Vote is expended to the HEA within the year, with some increases in funding due to Supplementary Estimates (as detailed below).</p><p>Table A - PRTLI funding 2010-2017<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Allocation &euro;m</td><td>49.9</td><td>57.9</td><td>54.7</td><td>45.2</td><td>39</td><td>55.5*</td><td>30.4**</td><td>14.4</td></tr></table></p><p>*2015 allocation included a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;23.5m in December 2015</p><p>**2016 allocation included a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;20m in December 2016 </p><p>The PRTLI allocation for 2018 is &euro;14.3m. A portion of this will be used to part pay outstanding bills for PRTLI Cycle 5 projects. In addition, a portion of this allocation will be used to commence a postgraduate programme funding both PhDs and Research Masters, as per the action in Innovation 2020. This new programme will be administered by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and will fund postgraduate enrolments in disciplines under their remit. Further details will be provided by SFI over the coming months.</p><p>There is no specific allocation within the PRTLI for frontier research. Action 3.8 of Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, provides for a new programme to fund frontier research.  On 6<sup>th</sup>April, 2017, the Irish Research Council, an agency of the Department of Education and Skills launched the Frontier Research Programme (LAUREATE), with initial funding of &euro;2.5 million.</p><p>My Department and its agencies are important funders of research, with expenditure of &euro;394m in 2016. This accounts for approximately half of total Government investment in R&amp;amp;D. Other Departments also provided funding for research and development across sectors, estimated to be at &euro;367m in 2016. Government investment in R&amp;amp;D includes funding for programmes that encompass all disciplines and all types of research.</p></reply>

One of the post holders retired in 2016 and the Principal Solicitor post holder transferred out of the ODCE in January 2017. The Director reconfigured the job specifications associated with both roles to better reflect the organisation&rsquo;s current and future needs, on foot of which a competition was held to recruit 2 Enforcement Portfolio Managers. One of those posts has recently been filled and the other successful candidate is due to take up the role in the coming weeks. </p><p>A second Legal Adviser post holder transferred out of the ODCE in June 2017. The Director has, similarly, reconfigured the job specification associated with that role to better reflect the organisation&rsquo;s current and future needs. As a consequence, the Department is currently engaging with the Public Appointments Service with a view to recruiting an Enforcement Lawyer. That position is expected to be advertised in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Digital Forensics Specialist is a new role that was created following a review, undertaken by the Director of the ODCE&rsquo;s skills mix and capabilities.</p><p>Similarly, 5 new Forensic Accountant posts were created following the aforementioned review (bringing to 7 the number of approved posts). Following two open competitions, 6 Forensic Accountants were recruited, of which one has since been promoted. A third competition, aimed at filling the 2 vacancies, is scheduled to be advertised in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Compliance Manager post fell vacant in November 2016, following the promotion of the post holder. The Director has indicated that this post, similarly, requires to be reconfigured to better reflect the ODCE&rsquo;s current and future needs. However, prioritisation has been afforded to filling the Forensic Accountant, Digital Forensics Specialist, Enforcement Portfolio Manager and Enforcement Lawyer posts respectively and to assimilating a substantial number of new, and senior, staff into the organisation. </p><p>Reflective of the process of further professionalisation of the ODCE that has been underway over the past 5 years, the significant increase in professional staff has been accompanied by a reduction in staff numbers in certain general civil service grades. </p><p>An Inspector has been assigned to the ODCE by Garda management in recent days, as a consequence of which the ODCE is now at its approved Garda complement of 7 staff. </p><p><b><i>2.

These costs, as well as their timing, are difficult to forecast as the ODCE has little or no control over the timing of when the cases will be determined. It is also the case that the ODCE cannot be sure of the outcome of cases in terms of costs orders and it cannot anticipate the scale of costs that other parties may seek.  Whilst it is entirely prudent that provision continue to be made to meet legal costs in the ODCE&rsquo;s subhead, a corollary is uncertainty in relation to the amount and timing etc. of such costs.</p><p>Specific provision was made in the Office&rsquo;s pay allocation from 2015 to allow for the recruitment of additional staff, including additional specialist staff such as forensic accountants and a digital forensic specialist. The reality, however, has been that notwithstanding the increased pay allocation, it has taken some time to effect the recruitment of the specialist staff concerned, as the Department, in common with many other State organisations, faces significant challenges in the recruitment of high quality professional staff.</p><p>The pay related costs for the Garda&iacute; assigned to the ODCE are borne by the Department of Justice and Equality and such pay costs are not reflected in the financial table above.</p><p>The distribution of the 2018 allocations across my Department's Vote, including that of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, will be determined through the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) process.  It is expected that publication of the 2018 REV allocations will be made by my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in early December 2018.</p></reply>

The number of unemployed fell by 45,100 (a 2.4% reduction) leading to a reduction of the unemployment rate from 8.6% in Q2 2016 to 6% in October 2017. For the first time since Q3 2010 the number of long term unemployed accounts for less than 50% of total unemployment.</p>  <p>  Between June 2015 and January 2016, my Department published eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, aimed at raising employment levels in the regions and facilitating them to achieve their economic potential. Each plan contains a series of actions with timelines for delivery between 2015-2017, through improved collaboration between enterprise agencies and other stakeholders supporting enterprise development in the regions. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs and Regional Action Plans for Jobs are monitored by the Department of the Taoiseach on a quarterly basis, with the Regional Action Plans for Jobs overseen by a Regional Implementation Committee.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs are supported by a Regional Enterprise Fund of up to &euro;60 million, which was launched in May 2017 to drive enterprise development and job creation in the regions. This funding has been provided by DBEI, through Enterprise Ireland, to 2020.  DBEI has granted &euro;150 million over five years to the IDA regional property programme, which invests in property solutions outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  The annual Action Plan for Jobs combined with the Regional Action Plan for Jobs are delivering significant results, as evidenced through the rise in employment since 2016 (please see the supplementary material attached). </p>  <p>  An objective within Enterprise 2025 is to ensure that unemployment across the regions is within one percent of the national average by end 2020.  Although considerable progress is being made overall, two regions - the Midlands and the South East - have yet to achieve our ambition. These two regions were the greatest hit during the recession. There are differences in the enterprise structure, occupational profiles and productivity levels of the enterprise base across regions which can explain the differences in the recovery to some extent. The Action Plan for Jobs, and Regional Action plans are key mechanisms for implementation and monitoring of progress for Enterprise 2025. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive Review of Enterprise 2025 is being finalised and the analysis points to solid progress toward achieving a suite of metrics, including employment, export growth, start-up activity, scaling of Irish owned enterprises etc. </p></reply>

My Department and agencies have a range of initiatives to connect with Irish emigrants (and others) and outline the careers and entrepreneurial opportunities in Ireland:</p>  <p>  - IDA Ireland actively promotes Ireland as a location for new investment and Enterprise Ireland has specific targets to attract entrepreneurs to Ireland with a focused marketing programme  underway in international markets.</p>  <p>  - Since 2016, My Department is funding Tech/Life Ireland &ndash; a partnership  with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Irish Technology Industry to promote brand Ireland as a top destination to pursue a career in technology and attract 3,000 top tech professionals to Ireland each year. Industry is playing an important role in supporting the initiative and driving its development.</p>  <p>  - Science Foundation Ireland encourages leading researchers to move to Ireland raising Ireland's profile as a location for excellent research and career advancement. For instance, each year, SFI awards two Saint Patrick Day Science Medals to distinguished Irish scientist, engineer or technology leaders living and working in the USA: one of academic and one for industry.</p>  <p>  Ensuring a continued focus on attracting foreign direct investment and maintaining and improving competitiveness is critical to attracting talent back to Ireland. </p></reply>

These initiatives involved the development of further guidance and advice materials and the organisation of, participation in, or support of a wide range of agriculture related events such as the Farm Tractor &amp;amp; Machinery Trade Association, Assisting in Knowledge Transfer Group Facilitator Training, Head to Toe Mental Health Day, Farmer of the Year Awards, Farm Safety Months, (March/Livestock, May/Tractors&amp;amp; Machinery, November/Falls from Height &amp;amp; Falling Objects) , Teagasc Dairy Event, the Tullamore Show and the National Ploughing Championships.</p><p>The totality of the work of the HSA in relation to farm safety is not confined to specific farm safety initiatives or inspections.  In addition to such initiatives visits to farms by inspectors include routine unannounced inspections to monitor general safety &amp;amp; health standards and assess compliance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and other health and safety regulations, and to investigate complaints, fatal and serious farm accidents.  Typically in any one year there can be between 60 &ndash; 90 investigations on farms with the rest being unannounced inspections. In 2017 the HSA is carrying out three focused inspection campaigns each of one month duration.  The first focused on &ldquo;animal handling&rdquo;, the second on working with &ldquo;tractors &amp;amp; machinery&rdquo; and the third on &ldquo;working from heights &amp;amp; falling objects&rdquo;. </p><p>The HSA approach of redirecting some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives has continued through 2016 &amp;amp; in 2017 particularly through the Knowledge Transfer Groups of which 98 have been attended &amp;amp; supported so far this year.  Additionally all facilitators of knowledge transfer groups have now been trained in the essentials of occupational farm health and safety by Teagasc with the assistance of the HSA. </p></reply>

Based on Revenue&rsquo;s Post-Budget Ready Reckoner this is projected to raise around &euro;392 million in 2018. </p>  <p>  In my Budget statement I also announced an extension of consanguinity relief for another 3 years and that the stamp duty rate applying under that scheme would be fixed at 1%.  Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members and is particularly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief such Young Trained Farmer stamp duty exemption. </p>  <p>  Following further discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I decided that in addition to extending the period of the relief and fixing the associated stamp duty rate at 1% the age rule for the consanguinity relief will be removed.  This means that it will be possible for all gifts and sales of farmlands to closely related family members, who do not qualify for the 100% exemption from stamp duty under the Young Trained Farmer scheme, to benefit from the consanguinity relief at a stamp duty rate of 1%. </p>  <p>  The proposal outlined by the Deputy would result in a reduction in stamp duty yields which would have to be made up from other taxation measures in order to maintain overall Budget arithmetic.  I am informed by Revenue that the estimated loss in yield in this case would be in the order of &euro;32 million.  The Government must consider carefully any tax changes as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere. I have no plans to implement a special rate of stamp duty for agricultural land as suggested by the deputy.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual cases as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that should be applied in those cases. </p>  <p>  Motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  My understanding is that the factors include those such as the age and type of the car, the age of the driver, the claims record, driving experience, and the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  As all Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors prices can vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to different factors and the availability of cover, different insurance companies will use different thresholds.  </p>  <p>  While it is appreciated that the individual, the subject of the PQ, has been unsuccessful in getting a quote from another company, it is I think still worth noting that he Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance.  One of the tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and to &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.  A checklist for &ldquo;motor insurance shopping around&rdquo; is also provided.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that based on the information available, the conditions for granting the young trained farmer relief did not apply in the case of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  Consanguinity relief, for deeds of transfer signed before 11 October 2017 between related persons, reduces the amount of Stamp Duty payable by half.  For deeds of transfer executed on or after 11 October, consanguinity relief reduces the rate of duty payable to 1% (instead of 6%).  A number of conditions must be satisfied before the relief can be claimed.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in the case of the person concerned, the Stamp Duty Return made relates to a deed executed on 29 September 2017.  The conditions that had to be satisfied before consanguinity relief could apply were that the person transferring the land was, at the time of transfer of the land, under 67 years of age and the person to whom the land was transferred must farm the land for at least 6 years or lease it to someone who will farm it for at least 6 years.  In addition, the person farming the land must hold a specified qualification or obtain it within a period of four years from the date they get the land or spend at least 50% of their time farming land.</p>  <p>  I am advised that based on the information available to Revenue, the conditions for granting consanguinity relief were not satisfied in this instance and that the relief was not claimed on the Stamp Duty return.  There is, therefore, no overpayment of Stamp Duty and consequently no refund is due.  </p>  <p>  I should mention that while the Finance Bill 2017 abolishes the condition that the person transferring the land be under 67 years of age, this provision will only apply when the Bill becomes law and will then only apply to deeds executed on or after the date the Bill is enacted. </p></reply>

These are farmers who are under 35 years of age and have (or will have within a specified period following the receipt of the farm land) specified relevant educational qualifications (known as the &lsquo;green cert&rsquo;).   A &lsquo;young trained farmer&rsquo; is required to retain ownership of the farm land for a period of five years following the transfer and to actively farm the land during this period.  Section 81AA Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for this relief.</p>  <p>  In addition, a relief known as &lsquo;consanguinity relief&rsquo; applies in relation to transfers of farm land between certain blood relatives, including from parents to their children.  A reduced 1% rate of stamp duty applies subject to specified conditions.  The recipient of the farm land must actively farm the land for a period of at least six years or have (or will have within a specified period following the receipt of the farm land) specified relevant educational qualifications.  Alternatively, the farm land can be leased for at least six years to someone who satisfies either this active farming or educational qualification condition. </p>  <p>  Consanguinity relief currently applies where the person transferring the land is under 67 years of age.  There is no age limit on the recipient of the farm land.  However, Finance Bill 2017 contains measures to extend this relief for a further three years until 31 December 2020 and to remove the age limit of 67 years.  Both of these measures will come into effect on the enactment of the Finance Bill which I expect to happen around the end of December.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that a recipient of farm land could potentially avail of &lsquo;agricultural relief&rsquo; in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable value of agricultural property that is gifted or inherited.  Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for this relief. </p>  <p>  To qualify for the relief, the recipient of the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') must first qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date. </p>  <p>  In addition, a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land on a commercial basis for a period of at least six years following the gift or inheritance.  The relevance of a &lsquo;green cert&rsquo; is that the holder of such a certificate, while required to actually farm the land, is not subject to the requirement that he or she spends at least 50% of his or her normal working time doing this.</p>  <p>  The relationship between the person who provides the gift (i.e. the disponer) and the beneficiary determines the maximum tax-free threshold known as the &lsquo;Group threshold&rsquo; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit.  A son or a daughter is entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;310,000 for the purposes of computing the tax payable on the taxable value of any gift of agricultural property.</p></reply>

I am informed by Revenue that at this juncture it is not possible to assess what specific arrangements would be required if the UK left the Customs Union and Single Market or what post Brexit checks would be carried out.  The Chairman of Revenue has previously confirmed that Revenue is not looking for sites for customs posts.  Therefore it would be premature to consider hypothetical cost estimates.</p>  <p>  However, I am informed by Revenue that they are actively engaged in examining a range of scenarios in order to support Ireland's Brexit objectives.  This work is carried out by a significant number of staff, currently estimated as 25 full-time equivalents, of whom 12 are dedicated to Brexit work full time, supported by additional staff throughout the organisation as required.</p></reply>

It is important to stress that these results are based on the historical relationship between the euro-sterling exchange rate and other macroeconomic variables and as such are only indicative.</p><p>Most of the impact from such a shock is felt immediately with the level of GDP expected to fall by 0.6 percentage points in the first year relative to baseline with adverse impacts on the deficit and debt ratios.  Overall, the level of output would be 0.5%  lower over the medium-term relative to baseline. This, in turn, would worsen the deficit path with the effect declining to 0.2 percentage points after 6 years.</p><p>The margin of error on scaled estimates is likely to be significant as the impact from exchange rate appreciation is likely to be non-linear.</p><p><b>5 per cent euro-sterling appreciation</b><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th><b>T</b></th><th><b>T+1</b></th><th><b>T+2</b></th><th><b>T+3</b></th><th><b>T+4</b></th><th><b>T+5</b></th></tr><tr><td>Real GDP</td><td>% change compared to base</td><td>-0.6</td><td>-0.8</td><td>-1.0</td><td>-0.9</td><td>-0.8</td><td>-0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Deficit-GDP ratio</td><td>pp change compared to base</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Debt-GDP ratio</td><td>pp change compared to base</td><td>2.8</td><td>3.6</td><td>4.2</td><td>4.3</td><td>4.1</td><td>3.5</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Source: ESRI, based on HERMES model estimates as published in Stability Programme Update 2016 (SPU 2016 page 27)</b></p><p>As we cannot control the international environment or exchange rate developments, it is crucially important that continued competitiveness improvements are achieved, including by focussing on costs we can control and by boosting our productivity.  Ensuring a sustainable path for the public finances is also of fundamental importance.</p><p>In that context, on the fiscal side the Government has continued its policy focus of enhancing the resilience of our public finances to any Brexit-related shock.  Specifically, it is projected that Ireland will achieve its medium-term budgetary objective of a balanced budget next year.  Linked to this, over the forecast horizon, it is projected that the Debt-to-GDP ratio will continue on a downward trajectory, reaching the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) 60 per cent threshold in the early part of the next decade and continuing to improve thereafter. </p><p>Whilst not complacent to potential challenges, including our currently elevated debt level, these developments will help provide fiscal capacity in the event of Brexit.  Complementing this, Budget 2018 established the &lsquo;Rainy Day Fund&rsquo;, which provides a further counter-cyclical buffer, and represents an important measure to strengthen the shock absorption capacity of the national finances to such external risks. </p><p>Budget 2018 also announced further measures to prepare Ireland&rsquo;s economy for the significant challenges ahead.  These measures include:</p><p>- a doubling of capital investment between 2015 to 2021 - boosting the growth potential of the economy</p><p>- improving the competitiveness of our personal tax system - through income tax reform</p><p>- introducing a Key Employment Engagement Programme (KEEP) &ndash; a new incentive to attract key employees</p><p>- a new &euro;300 million Loan Guarantee Scheme for Brexit-impacted business and a complementary &euro;25 million Agriculture Brexit Loan Scheme &ndash; targeted at enhancing the competitiveness of the businesses most exposed to Brexit</p><p>- the retention of the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector to reduce the impact of currency volatility in the wake of the UK&rsquo;s decision</p><p>- the doubling of additional Brexit-related staff in state agencies.</p><p>The Government also continues to encourage businesses to make contact with their Local Enterprise Office, Bord Bia or Enterprise Ireland for free services to help them build a plan for Brexit.  The enterprise agencies will  work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit - making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.</p><p>Furthermore, the Government will also exploit fully any opportunities that arise.  The Government will continue through the IDA to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for companies and talented people who are looking to establish or expand operations in what will be the only native English-speaking country within the EU and the Eurozone.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the State is already providing a number of alternative supports into this market, including equity finance, through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund's (ISIF) existing residential development funding platforms. </p>  <p>  I would be hopeful of bringing the establishing legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in early 2018, with a view to HBFI commencing operations later in 2018.  It is not expected that HBFI will have an indefinite lifespan but it is too early to speculate on how long it may operate as this will depend on the availability of funding in the market to meet demand for homes in the coming years.</p>  <p>  With a proposed allocation of up to &euro;750m, it is estimated that HBFI could have capacity to fund about 6,000 homes in the coming years.  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the products that will be offered by HBFI, the fund will be designed to focus on the provision of debt funding to viable residential development projects. HBFI will not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender and therefore will not have any role in designing the schemes it funds.  HBFI will provide lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor.  As such HBFI will not have targets in relation to social or affordable housing but will provide a significant contribution to supporting the delivery of additional supply of all types of residential housing in the coming years. </p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the publication of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  These final Plans are currently undergoing an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, I would hope by the end of this year or early 2018, to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the 29 Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.  </p>  <p>  Thereafter, I would hope to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those Plans that will, over the coming years, be taken, through a prioritised approach, to detailed design to protect those communities at assessed risk. </p>  <p>  The preferred measure for Ballybay published in the draft Plans in 2016 consisted of a series of flood embankments and walls.  These hard defences will extend for a total length of 2.5km with an average height of 1.6m.  If approved, as part of the final Plans this option will provide protection to approximately 61 properties at risk of ﬂuvial ﬂooding. Approval for proposed schemes in the Plans, allows for their progression to detailed design, further environmental assessments and public consultation. </p></reply>

Many special schools now enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.</p>  <p>  The need to establish a new special school would normally be first identified by the National Council for Special Education in conjunction with my Department when they identify gaps in special needs provision in a given area. </p>  <p>  There are 37 Special Schools in Dublin city and county. The NCSE has advised my Department that there is an emerging need for additional Special School placement options in the North Dublin area. My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special school placements can access such placements.  </p></reply>

By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. </p>  <p>  Further additional temporary Language Support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support.  At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board and at post-primary level to the Post Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

It is important to emphasise that our approach has not been merely to recruit or assign additional staff, but rather also to prioritise Brexit in the work of our entire Department.  Additional staff have been assigned to the key Divisions with responsibility for Brexit matters, the European Union Division and the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division, to cover the issues arising from the UK exit process.  For operational and service oriented units like the Passport Office and Consular service, there has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and in Britain. </p>  <p>  Many business units of my Department at headquarters in Dublin are involved in some way as part of the response to the UK exit.  For example the Legal Division, the Trade Division and the Policy Planning Unit.  </p>  <p>  Overseas, additional posts have been assigned to our Embassies in London, Berlin, and Paris as well as the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels.</p>  <p>  To support the complex and intensive negotiation process, my Department received an additional &euro;3.2 million as part of the 2017 allocation.  The Department has also allocated an additional budget of &euro;2 million.  This budget was used to increase the number of staff assigned to the management and support of the negotiations and to increase the level of support provided to our colleagues across all Government Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  These measures remain under review.  The Department will allocate additional staff resources as deemed necessary to further augment our level of support across Government and across our network.</p></reply>

It has serious social, health and psychological consequences and is one of the most pervasive forms of gender based violence.  Girls and women subjected to FGM are at risk of early marriage and dropping out of school.  In turn, this is linked to reduced opportunities for growth, development and sustainable incomes more generally.  It is estimated that more than three million girls are at risk of undergoing FGM every year.Ireland played a central role at the United Nations brokering the Sustainable Development Goals, which asks all UN members to eliminate FGM by 2030.  Ireland advocated strongly for the inclusion of this particular target on FGM, which is intended to provide much needed impetus to international action to end this appalling practice.</p><p>Tackling violence against women and girls is an important focus of Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme, which we see as critical to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Through our support for multilateral organisations and NGOs, together with policy work at multiple levels, Irish official development assistance works towards the elimination of FGM, as well as towards tackling many of its root causes, including persistent poverty and gender inequality.</p><p>In addition to core funding of &euro;10 million in 2017 to the UN agencies most involved in addressing FGM (UNICEF and UNFPA), Ireland also supports those agencies&rsquo; <i>Joint Programme on Eliminating FGM: Accelerating Change</i>.  Since the Joint Programme was launched in 2007, Ireland has provided over &euro;1 million in funding, including, most recently, &euro;250,000 in 2016.  The next phase of the Joint Programme on Eliminating FGM is due to run from 2018 to 2021. </p><p>A new White Paper on Ireland&rsquo;s policy on international development will prepared in the first half of next year.  This will set out clear priorities for the coming years, including on how Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

Human rights protections form a vital part of the institutional underpinning for the peace settlement founded on the Good Friday Agreement and serve to build and maintain confidence for communities across Northern Ireland.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland - including through the incorporation into law of the European Convention on Human Rights - is one of the key principles of the Agreement, as set out in the chapter on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity.  It is important to be clear that the European Convention on Human Rights is separate and distinct to the European Union.  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, it is welcome that the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on legislating for withdrawal from the EU that was published in March clarified that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>In February, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit, the Government convened a Sectoral Dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South, on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the Agreement.  This was a very valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, which have been communicated publicly, which are informing the Government&rsquo;s approach in this area, including as set out in the comprehensive document, <i>Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union</i>, published by the Government on 2 May. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with EU partners has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by the EU27 and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position for the Article 50 negotiations with the UK.  In this regard, the Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, which were published by the European Commission Article 50 Task Force in September, confirm that European Union law and practice has provided a supporting framework in Northern Ireland and across the island for the Good Friday Agreement provisions on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity.  They state that the Good Friday Agreement requires equivalent standards of protection of rights in Ireland and Northern Ireland and that the United Kingdom should ensure that no diminution of rights is caused by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s departure from the European Union, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination currently enshrined in Union law.  This position has been conveyed by the European Commission Task Force to the UK in the Article 50 negotiations in the High Level Dialogue on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p><p>As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously our responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles, including in the area of human rights.  The Government will continue to pursue, with our EU partners, an outcome to the Article 50 process that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including to ensure protection of and respect for the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.</p></reply>

Our policy for International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as economic conditions allow.</p><p>The current Programme for Government sets out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit.  This progress needs to be made in a sustainable and manageable way, building on Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in contributing to ending global poverty and hunger, and in providing humanitarian assistance.  In order to prepare for greater progress towards the UN target, a new White Paper on Irish overseas development assistance will be produced next year.</p><p>For 2018, the Government has allocated just over &euro;707 million for ODA, the third consecutive year ODA has increased.  Based on current estimates, it is anticipated this level of allocation to deliver an ODA/GNI target of approximately 0.3%.</p><p>In line with EU member states, we remain committed to making incremental, sustainable and manageable progress towards achieving the 0.7% UN target by 2030, over the period of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Reaching this target will involve significant increases to the ODA budget and requires careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders, which will be informed by the White Paper process next year. </p><p>The table sets out a sample stepped scenario for meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030, with interim targets of 0.4% in 2022, 0.5% in 2026 and 0.6% in 2028.  <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Total ODA <br /><br />In &euro; millions</th><th>ODA as a % of Projected GNP</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>707.10</td><td>0.30%</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>906.37</td><td>0.35%</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>1,109.29</td><td>0.40%</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>1,323.96</td><td>0.45%</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>1,560.65</td><td>0.50%</td></tr><tr><td>2028</td><td>1,986.83</td><td>0.60%</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>2,459.13</td><td>0.70%</td></tr></table></p><p>We have used forecasts for Gross National Product (GNP) as a proxy for GNI in the above calculations because GNI is only calculated retrospectively.

Protecting our economic interests in terms of trade and investment with the UK is a key priority for my Department, as well as the need to drive further diversification of our trade and investment flows globally.  We have already augmented our diplomatic teams in Berlin, Paris, London and Brussels to manage the negotiation process and in part to support trade promotion efforts in the United Kingdom and the Eurozone.  Those posts are detailed in the table.  </p><p>My priority as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be to maintain, grow and diversify our share of international trade, employment and investment given the challenges of Brexit and a more competitive world.  The recent decision to open six new diplomatic missions was informed by this objective.  The benefits to the country in terms of expanded influence and the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s interests and values are expected to be considerable in the years ahead.  New Embassies will open in Santiago, Chile; Bogot&aacute;, Colombia; Amman, Jordan; and Wellington, New Zealand; and new Consulates General in Vancouver, western Canada and Mumbai, India, on a phased basis from 2018.  The expansion will be guided by my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy, which provides the overarching framework for our strategic objectives and operational targets.  Our expanded network will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s visibility globally, extend our influence and position us for trade and investment growth in new and existing markets.  It will also benefit travelling citizens and engagement with the Diaspora.  <table><tr><th>Location</th><th>Additional Posts Sanctioned post 23 June 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the EU, Brussels</td><td>1 Counsellor<br /><br />1 First Secretary<br /><br />1 Third Secretary</td></tr><tr><td>Embassy of Ireland, Paris</td><td>1 Counsellor</td></tr><tr><td>Embassy of Ireland, Berlin</td><td>1 Counsellor</td></tr><tr><td>Embassy of Ireland, London</td><td>1 First Secretary</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2 Third Secretaries</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1 Higher Executive Officer</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1 Executive Officer</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5 Interns</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to the posts listed above, Embassy London has also been augmented in response to an increased demand for passports and foreign birth registrations, and some 10 additional local staff were hired in other missions overseas. </p><p>The measures my Department have put in place to manage our response to the UK decision to leave the EU remain under review as the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU intensify.

In line with this the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021.  I am pleased that Budget 2018 will facilitate the continued strengthening of the Reserve next year with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018 following the undertaking of a recruitment campaign earlier this year.</p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing.  To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion before the end of this year.  As a first step the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve from the Human Resource and People Development Directorate to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement.  This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens.  This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground engaging with local communities.</p><p>The review will take cognisance of the changed environment in which the expanded Reserve will operate as the major reform programme that is underway is implemented.  These reforms include the drive towards a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021 to boost the management capacity of the organisation and to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties, and also the phased implementation of the Divisional model of policing to enable resources to be deployed more efficiently to prevent and detect crime.</p><p><b>Garda Reserve Strength 31 October 2017</b><table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>DMR South Central </td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North Central</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North </td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>DMR East</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>DMR South</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>DMR West</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West </td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>603</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 October 2017, the latest date for which numbers are readily available, there were 2,151 full time civilian staff members working throughout the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.<b></b>I am further informed that the attached table details the number of civilian staff currently deployed in each Garda Division as of that date.  The balance of civilian staff are attached to Garda Headquarters and carryout various roles including in HR, Finance,  ICT, as well as the Garda College.  </p><p>As part of its Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  The projected 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians.  The 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians where necessary. </p><p>So far this year some 150 additional civilians have been recruited to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This has allowed the filling of critical skills and capacity gaps across the organisation and will facilitate the redeployment of the first batch of 43 Garda&iacute;. By quarter 1 next year the Commissioner projects that some 160 Garda&iacute; will have been redeployed.  This is a welcome start but as illustrated by the Garda Inspectorate Report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot; there is considerable scope for redeployment to operational policing.  The Inspectorate Report identified some 1,500 posts that could be suitable.  Furthermore Garda management completed an organisation deployment survey earlier this year which identifies some 2,000 posts for further examination in this regard.  It will take a determined effort by Garda management over the next number of years to achieve redeployments on this scale but I can assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the target of 20% and to ensuring that the unprecedented investment in the workforce and other resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are used to optimum effect to provide effective policing services across the country. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that a number civilians have been appointed to newly created senior leadership posts to support the major reform programme underway including an Executive Director for Strategy and Transformation and an Executive Director for Legal And Compliance.  A competition is underway for another critical senior post, that of Chief Data Officer.  This transformation of the composition of the senior team will assist in bring diverse perspectives and management skills to the top levels in the organisation.</p><p>I am pleased to say that I have secured funding for the recruitment of up to a further 500 civilians in Budget 2018 to support the continuation of this major programme of civilianisation.<b></b></p><p><b>Garda Civilian Strength 31 October 2017</b><table><tr><th>Division</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>DMR   South Central</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>DMR   North Central</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>DMR   North</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>DMR   East</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>DMR   South</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>DMR   West</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   City</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   North</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   West</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>924</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published in June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. </p><p>These Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  In addition, each Community Policing Team will be supported by a Community Safety Forum.  The Forum which will comprise of local Garda&iacute;, members of the public and community groups will promote crime prevention strategies.  This clear and consistent approach to community policing will ensure a better service and enhanced community safety.</p><p>In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed by the Commissioner that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams and Community Safety Fora will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Executive for implementation.  The Commissioner anticipates that a number of Community Policing Teams will be established on a pilot basis early next year. </p><p>Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy as provided by the Commissioner is set out in the table.</p><p>Community Garda 31 October 2017<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.S.C.</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>DMR NC</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>DMR EAST</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>DMR SOUTH</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>DMR WEST</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>690 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>At Divisional level it is a matter for the Divisional Officer to determine how best to allocate personnel, so as to ensure the delivery of an effective policing service.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  As the Deputy will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise.  For this reason, the number of Garda available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Kildare Division was 354.  There are also 20 Garda Reserves and 30 civilians attached to the Kildare Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Response Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 72 were assigned to the Kildare Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

The Minister for Justice and Equality found, on 30 May last, that in an international protection system with no temporal limits as to when the application process will be concluded, an absolute prohibition on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.  The Court recognised that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly has adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months.</p>  <p>  Following the approval of Government, I established an Inter-Departmental Taskforce in July to examine the wide-ranging implications of the judgment, and to consider appropriate solutions.  The Taskforce was comprised of representatives from nine Government Department, along with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  On 21 November 2017, the Government approved the recommendations of the Taskforce, including the key recommendation that the State should respond to the judgment by opting-in to the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive (2013/33/EU).</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of arranging for the Motions to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Following the approval of both Houses, the opt-in procedure with the formal notifications to the European Council and the European Commission will commence. The European Commission then has four months from receipt of this letter to confirm our participation.  During these four months, the State will be required to demonstrate to the Commission how it is compliant with each Article in the Directive.</p>  <p>  The EU Directive provides, inter-alia, that international protection applicants shall have access to the labour market no later than nine months from the date the application for international protection was lodged, if a first instance decision has not been taken and if the delay cannot be attributed to the applicant.</p>  <p>  The Government has established an Implementation Group to oversee the opt-in procedure and the practical arrangements for facilitating access to the labour market for eligible applicants.

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose.  As in all of the IRM cases, Counsel considered the matters raised by the complainant, the actions already taken in relation to the complaint, and the possible options open to pursue matters.  Counsel were then required to use their knowledge and experience of the criminal justice system to recommend whether further action was either possible or appropriate and if so, to recommend the relevant action to be taken.</p>  <p>  In this particular case referred to by the Deputy, Counsel's initial recommendation was that the complainant should be contacted and asked to provide the corroborative evidence referred to in his original correspondence.  Some additional material was provided by the person.  Counsel considered this additional material and, having done so, recommended that the Minister should take no further action in the matter.  My predecessor accepted Counsel's recommendation and the individual in question was notified of her decision and the reasons for it.</p>  <p>  The report referred to by the Deputy is awaited and I have asked my officials to pursue the matter urgently with the Commissioner.  I will revert to the Deputy on receipt of same.</p></reply>

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in 14 provincial court offices.</p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that a Grant of Representation in a deceased person's estate may be required for a variety of reasons, including the transfer of title to property, and statistics as to why a Grant must issue are not maintained in the Probate Office/Registries.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that its statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide the number of probate applications which relate to residential homes. This information could only be obtained by the examination of each individual application, which would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time which would not be warranted. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the number of homes affected as sought by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that when the Probate Office/Registries are notified that there is a sale of property pending in an estate, this Grant is always expedited. In the Probate Office in Dublin it usually issues within a 2 to 3 week timeframe in Solicitors' applications, while Personal Applicants are seen by appointment as soon as possible and the Grant issues within 3 to 4 days of their appointment with the Probate Office.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that it is aware of the lengthy waiting times for probate applications and particularly personal applications to the Probate Office in Dublin and is working to improve the situation. Additional resources have been provided to the Probate Office and to address the current delays further additional resources are being made available.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service is currently finalising a full review of the probate system and it is anticipated that a report with recommendations for the modernisation of the process will be completed by the end of 2017 for presentation to the senior management team of the Courts Service and to the Courts Service Board.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the District referred to is part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) East Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the D.M.R. East Division was 376 of which 201 were assigned to the Dun Laoghaire District. There are also 10 Garda Reserves and 22 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, the Armed Response Unit and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 57 of whom have been assigned to the D.M.R. East Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the D.M.R. East Division, in the coming years.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the  31 October 2017, the latest date for which numbers are readily available there were 2,151 full time civilian staff members working throughout the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.<b></b></p><p>As part of its Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. The projected 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians. </p><p>Additional funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided in Budget 2018 to facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level. These appointments are intended to facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the cost of recruiting Garda civilian staff in any given year is dependent on the mix of grades involved, however for the purposes of estimating the cost of civilian staff generally, an average figure of &euro;43,000.</p><p>On that basis, the following table outlines costings for sample numbers of recruitments and it enables the Deputy to extrapolate the figures for the specific numbers requested by him. <table><tr><th>Number of Garda Civilians to be recruited</th><th>Estimated Annual Cost</th></tr><tr><td>100 </td><td>&euro;4,300,000</td></tr><tr><td>200 </td><td>&euro;8,600,000 </td></tr><tr><td>400 </td><td>&euro;17,200,000 </td></tr><tr><td>600</td><td>&euro;25,800,000</td></tr><tr><td>800</td><td>&euro;34,400,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, this is partly attributable to a substantial number of Reserves joining the Garda&iacute; as full-time members in recent years. </p>  <p>  It is also attributable to the need for Garda management and the Public Appointments Service to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns for Garda trainees over those for Reserves. I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that this was the right call to make in the circumstances. </p>  <p>  Fortunately, with Garda recruitment up and running successfully it was possible to enable a recruitment campaign for the Garda to get underway in March. It attracted approximately 2,400 applicants of whom around 1,600 were successful following assessment. To date approximately 500 applicants have been referred on to the Garda Appointment Office from the Public Appointment Service for vetting and medical. I am advised that applicants from this campaign will enter training in early 2018. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware service in the Garda Reserve is voluntary and unpaid. However, an allowance is payable to Reserve members who complete a minimum of 208 hours duty annually as a contribution towards expenses incurred in performing their duties. The allowance is currently set at &euro;1,000 per annum. As this is a fixed allowance it does not change year to year. In addition, the uniform cost per Reserve member is in the region of &euro;1,300. </p>  <p>  Reserves are also reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service as a Reserve.</p>  <p>  Thus, the cost of recruiting new reserve is some &euro;2,300 for the first year and &euro;1,000 per annum thereafter assuming completion of the hours required. It is a relatively straightforward calculation thereafter to calculate the costs involved for the numbers set out in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</p>  <p>  As far as increasing the reserve from 607 to 2,500, the cost would be some &euro;4.35 million (i.e. 1,893 x &euro;2,300).</p></reply>

The system is also used to monitor some hospital in-patients who have been granted temporary release from Prison.  It thus allows for a significant reduction in staffing costs for hospital escorts.</p><p>The current service provider allows for the provision of up to 50 electronic tags to the Irish Prison Service. As of Sunday 26th November 2017 there have been 113 prisoners electronically monitored while on temporary release since March 2013.  This figure includes 7 cases who are currently being monitored.  The total cost of this service to the Irish Prison Service to date is &euro;529,527.  The contract requires a minimum usage of 20 tags.</p><p>I am advised by The Irish Prison Service that the average cost per prisoner is impacted upon by the total number of days per year that prisoners are electronic monitored.  The table below provides the information as requested by the Deputy in PQ 51078/17.<table><tr><th>YEAR </th><th>NO. OF PRISONERS TAGGED</th><th>TOTAL NO. OF DAYS</th><th>AVERAGE COST PER DAY PER PRISONER/TAG</th></tr><tr><td>2013 (March to December) </td><td>18</td><td>1564</td><td>&euro;15.51</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (January to December)</td><td>23</td><td>2757</td><td>&euro;26.83</td></tr><tr><td>*2015 (January to December)</td><td>8</td><td>716</td><td>&euro;214.64</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (January to December)</td><td>22</td><td>2752</td><td>&euro;47.13</td></tr><tr><td>2017 (January to October)</td><td>42</td><td>2274</td><td>&euro;64.92</td></tr></table></p><p>The current contract provides for a maximum of 50 tags.  Therefore it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the information requested in respect of the cost of providing additional monitoring for 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 prisoners as this would be outside the current contract parameters.</p></reply>

The Act will provide that electronic monitoring may be imposed as a bail condition if the prosecution applies to the court for such a condition.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the progress of the Act through the Oireachtas, a Working Group on Electronic Monitoring was established in my Department in December 2016.  The Group, which has been tasked with examining a range of issues surrounding the implementation of electronic monitoring in an Irish context, is comprised of officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Group will submit their final report to the Management Board of my Department in the near future.  The Management Board will then consider the recommendations in the context of bringing the relevant legislative provisions into force.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the impact that speculation in relation to costs can have on commercial matters, particularly where there may be a requirement for a procurement process.  In this context, I would expect that any recommendations made by the Working Group, which have a cost element associated with them, would be fully examined by the Management Board and careful thought given to any procurement implications that might arise.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, it would be inappropriate and unhelpful to engage in any such speculation at this stage.</p></reply>

My Department also provides further ongoing funding to Foras na Gaeilge in respect of ringfenced activities relating to Cl&aacute;r na Leabhar Gaeilge and Colmcille.  Budget allocations to Foras na Gaeilge are in respect of current expenditure only.  </p>  <p>  My Department provided overall current funding of &euro;12.528m to Foras na Gaeilge in 2016, comprising the Department's share of the NSMC budget, ringfenced funding for Cl&aacute;r na Leabhar Gaeilge and Colmcille in addition to additional unmatched funding for one-off projects outside of the NSMC approved business plan.  </p>  <p>  In regard to 2017, as the Deputy will appreciate, it has not been possible to date to have Foras na Gaeilge&rsquo;s business plan and budget formally approved by the NSMC.  Therefore, as an interim measure, it was been agreed to proceed with an indicative budget based on the 2016 NSMC approved budget.  In that context, I can inform the Deputy that an overall indicative provision of &euro;13.989m was provided within my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2017 in respect of both agencies of An Foras Teanga, representing an increase of &euro;0.788m over the Estimates provision in 2016.  This increased funding was approved in the context of the significant cutbacks in recent years and to meet current challenges, in particular the one-off costs associated with Foras na Gaeilge's move to a new headquarters in 2017.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, the position regarding the NSMC 2018 budget for Foras na Gaeilge is not clear at this point in time.  However, I can inform the Deputy that an overall indicative provision of &euro;14.028m has been provided within my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2018 in respect of both agencies of An Foras Teanga.  This increased funding includes a provision for Bliain na Gaeilge 2018.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p>  <p>  To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. </p>  <p>  An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. </p>  <p>  Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p>  <p>  Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months. No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.</p>  <p>  All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP. </p>  <p>  Full details of the Versatis review are available on the HSE website athttp://hse.ie/eng/about/Who/clinical/natclinprog/medicinemanagementprogramme/yourmedicines/lidocaine-plaster/lidocaine-medicated-plaster.html.</p>  <p>  This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.</p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway.  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p></reply>

Latest data from September 2017 shows that the public/private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective in-patient work and at almost 86% for day-case work.  This is consistent with the typical 80/20 split provided for in the consultant contract.  The framework for the regulation of a consultant's private practice is contained in Section 20 of Consultant Contract 2008.  It provides that the public to private practice ratio is to be implemented through the Clinical Directorate structure.  It also gives the employer of the consultant concerned full authority to take all necessary steps to ensure a Consultant's practice shall not exceed the agreed ratio of public to private practice. </p>  <p>  However it is clear that the arrangements in place are not robust enough to deliver compliance in all circumstances and, as a result, some consultants are able to engage in private practice activity at levels that significantly exceed the permitted levels, or else they may engage in significant levels of off-site private practice, although their contract does not provide for this.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are being enforced and to put in place structures that support compliance.  I have asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure consultants comply with their contractual obligations.  It is a matter for the HSE and hospital management to determine whether a system of clocking in for consultants should be part of these structures. </p>  <p>  In the longer term I have established an independent group, chaired by Dr Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system.  This was one of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare Report.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-29a.702.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900083#WRR01300"><p>Regulations were signed by the then Minister for Health on 5 May 2016  which provide for the introduction of the new Rural Practice Support Framework (RPSF), which includes improved qualifying criteria for rural support and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216.07 to &euro;20,000 per annum.  Under the new Framework, if two practice units are providing general practitioner services in the same qualifying area, both practices may qualify for a modified allowance of &euro;10,000. GPs holding a permanent GMS contract who received the Rural Practice Allowance of &euro;16,216.07 immediately prior to the introduction of the new Regulations who do not meet the new qualifying criteria continue to receive the payment on a personal basis, provided they retain their contractual commitment to the remote rural area. </p>  <p>  As at 27 November 2017, there are 249 practice units in receipt of rural supports under the RPSF. 175 practices receive the financial allowance of &euro;20,000 and 18 practices receive the modified allowance of &euro;10,000. The full year cost of increasing the existing allowance to &euro;25,000 and the corresponding modified allowance to &euro;12,500 for these practices would amount to approximately &euro;920,000. It must be emphasised that this estimate does not take account of any future increase in the number of qualifying practices. In addition, any increase in the financial allowance under the new RPSF would only apply to those practices that qualify under the new criteria, therefore these calculations have excluded the 56 GPs who currently receive the old financial allowance of &euro;16,216.07.</p></reply>

To this end, the Programme has developed a detailed Implementation Plan which I was pleased to launch last month.  The Plan is presented under the Strategy's four strategic priorities and details how each of the 77 actions will be implemented.  It represents another essential building block to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service. </p>  <p>  The Programme has estimated that full implementation of the Strategy will cost in the region of an additional &euro;80 million revenue funding over the lifetime of the Strategy.  Work to identify the precise capital funding requirement is ongoing.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and therefore the funding requirement will vary from year to year.  In that context, the Implementation Plan will inform the annual Estimates process each year. </p>  <p>   I can confirm that additional funding will be provided for the Strategy  in 2018, the detail of which will be set out in the National Service Plan 2018. </p></reply>

Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive. Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing. </p></reply>

The Officeis overseeing a programme of patient safety measures including progressing a programme of legislation.  The General Scheme of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill approved by Government in November 2015 provides for the extension of the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s (HIQA&rsquo;s) remit to the private sector, mandatory external reporting of Serious Reportable Events and measures to promote clinical audit.  The Bill has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny (PLS) with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and the PLS Report is currently being considered by the Department. The Patient Safety Licencing Bill will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals as well as certain designated high risk activities. The Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s Civil Liability Amendment Act 2017 includes provision for the open disclosure of patient safety incidents. </p><p>In addition, on 25 October 2017, I launched the <i>National Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents</i>. These standards, developed jointly by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, set out a new approach to the way health providers respond to, review and investigate incidents in order to determine as quickly as possible what may have transpired, and why, to ensure that they can immediately implement any improvements necessary to prevent a re-occurrence.  </p><p>Finally, it is my understanding that the Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently finalising the review of its Safety Incident Management Policy. </p></reply>

The Division co-ordinates the ongoing analysis, consultation and engagement activities being undertaken by a large number of administrative, technical and veterinary staff across the Department.  An internal Brexit Response Committee comprised of expertise drawn from the wide range of Divisions affected by Brexit (including, for example, Meat and Milk Policy, Animal Health and Welfare, Food Industry Development, Economics and Planning, and Seafood Policy and Development) has also been established.  The Brexit Unit feeds into the whole-of-Government co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Unit comes under the responsibility of an Assistant Secretary and is led by an experienced Principal Officer with a team of both experienced and newly recruited staff.  The cost of the unit has been accommodated within the existing sanctioned pay ceiling for the department.  The current staffing complement is 3 Assistant Principal Officers, 3 Higher Executive Officers/Administrative Officers and 1 Clerical Officer.  The estimated staffing and associated annual costs of the Brexit Unit are &euro;856,685.50.</p>  <p>  The function of this unit is to co-ordinate the Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit.  These extend across virtually every division in the department, from those dealing with veterinary and public and animal health, to plant health, border controls and the various sectoral policy divisions.  Staffing requirements for Brexit associated functions across the Department are constantly under review and additional resources will be assigned to relevant functions as the need arises.</p></reply>

The very successful &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for such schemes, including the new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which makes up to &euro;300 million of affordable, flexible financing available to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future.</p>  <p>  This fund will be supported by &euro;23 million in exchequer funding, with &euro;9 million from my Department and the remainder from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, by way of guarantee.  At least 40% of this fund will be available to food businesses.  The new Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders.  SBCI issued an open call on 21 November inviting lending institutions to participate.</p>  <p>  I also announced in the Budget that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of new Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and food businesses.  My Department has had preliminary engagement with the SBCI in this regard and further details will be available in 2018.</p>  <p>  Since the Brexit decision, my Department has placed great emphasis on enhancing its own capacity and that of Bord Bia&rsquo;s in the area of market diversification and new market access.  Following on from the extra &euro;10 million that I allocated to Bord Bia since the Brexit vote, I will be providing an additional &euro;4.5 million in Budget 2018 to assist the agency in its promotional and developmental work overseas.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is working with the Department of An Taoiseach and other Government Departments on the expansion of the State&rsquo;s Global footprint, to ensure that the future development of the Irish agri-food sector is incorporated into this strategy.</p></reply>

I am confident that, as market demand for safe, sustainable, high quality dairy products in expanding global markets increases, the Irish dairy sector, from the farm gate to the further reaches of the supply chain, will continue to grow and prosper.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the impact of Storm Ophelia, particularly of course the tragic loss of life.  I would like to again pay tribute to the joined-up public service response, led by the National Emergency Coordination Group, including officials from my Department.</p>  <p>  The main impact of the storm on the dairy sector was in terms of power outages.  While this caused inconvenience and expense for some individual farmers, similar issues arose for small businesses across the country.  ESB teams worked tirelessly to reconnect electricity supplies.  Many farmers also benefitted from back up generators shared between neighbours and at co-op level.</p>  <p>  This experience underlines the importance for dairy farmers to have a plan in place to access a back-up power supply in such circumstances.</p></reply>

This unit currently comprises a team of seven people led by an Assistant Principal Officer.

The work of the unit supports a meat industry with exports of over &euro;3 billion.</p>  <p>  The meat market access unit works on expanding market access for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry and cooked meats across a range of markets, and is also working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which Ireland already has access. </p>  <p>  This work involves staff across the department, including veterinary services, laboratory staff, inspectorate staff, Brexit/International Trade Division and a wide range of other divisions, in completing market access questionnaires, facilitating incoming inspection visits, participating in diplomatic meetings, agreeing export health certificates and so on.

No. 820 of 2007, as amended, sets out a minimum list of recyclable material that household waste collectors must accept.  A condition attached to household waste collection permits also provides that the permit holder shall implement and maintain an on-going programme of communication for their household kerbside waste customers in accordance with their customer charter or as may be required by the National Waste Collection Permit Office.  The customer charter, which household waste collectors are required to have in place, states that: <i>Information packs shall be available to all customers clearly indicating waste types appropriate to each bin and how to present material for recycling.</i></p><p>Household waste collectors are free, however, under that legislation to accept additional recyclable items not contained in the seventh schedule to S.I. No. 820 of 2007, as amended.  </p><p>Market research undertaken by my Department this year identified that this non-uniformity around what items go in which bin was causing some confusion.  This situation cannot continue, where just one contaminated item can ruin all our good recycling efforts.</p><p>I therefore announced yesterday that the Regional Waste Management Offices, Repak and the waste industry have worked together to address this issue and that for the first time ever, we have a single agreed list of items which can be placed in the recycle bin, regardless of where you live.  </p><p>Removing confusion will undoubtedly play a huge role in improving the quality of the material which goes in the recycle bin, helping to ensure that this material is actually recycled as opposed to being contaminated and sent for recovery or to landfill. </p><p>This definitive list and further information is available to download at http://recyclinglistireland.ie/ and will be used by all stakeholders as a platform for education and communication to further improve recycling in our respective communities.</p></reply>

Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).  In 2016 over &euro;17m was spent providing upgrades to 15,265 homes across Ireland.  To date in 2017 almost &euro;15m has been spent for upgrades to 13,577 homes. </p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes (BEWH) scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  The measures available typically include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs, cavity wall insulation and roof and wall ventilation.  In 2016 spend of &euro;17.1m provided upgrades to 6,839 homes.  To date in 2017 spend of &euro;15.2m has provided upgrades to 5,620 homes.<table><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Better Energy Homes</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Better Energy Warmer Homes</th></tr><tr><td>County</td><td></td><td>Homes Grant Aided</td><td></td><td>Spend</td><td></td><td>Homes Grant Aided</td><td></td><td>Spend</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2016</td><td>2017 YTD</td><td>2016</td><td>2017 YTD</td><td>2016</td><td>2017 YTD</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>141</td><td>141</td><td>&euro;143,950</td><td>130650</td><td>94</td><td>75</td><td>&euro;200,344.42</td><td>&euro;228,651.79</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>188</td><td>128</td><td>&euro;175,300</td><td>134750</td><td>90</td><td>63</td><td>&euro;272,327.16</td><td>&euro;193,371.15</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>296</td><td>277</td><td>&euro;361,550</td><td>334050</td><td>121</td><td>213</td><td>&euro;335,272.45</td><td>&euro;612,188.17</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>2,158</td><td>1,656</td><td>&euro;2,261,175</td><td>1787214.1</td><td>482</td><td>512</td><td>&euro;1,463,903.26</td><td>&euro;1,351,547.90</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>157</td><td>163</td><td>&euro;271,950</td><td>243325</td><td>294</td><td>220</td><td>&euro;865,165.32</td><td>&euro;861,355.92</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>4,738</td><td>4,383</td><td>&euro;5,956,419</td><td>5407969</td><td>867</td><td>1288</td><td>&euro;1,333,653.62</td><td>&euro;1,762,842.63</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>782</td><td>758</td><td>&euro;777,052</td><td>732300</td><td>248</td><td>492</td><td>&euro;774,750.53</td><td>&euro;1,559,271.93</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>421</td><td>355</td><td>&euro;608,800</td><td>522300</td><td>127</td><td>109</td><td>&euro;421,904.08</td><td>&euro;422,166.44</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>643</td><td>685</td><td>&euro;711,130</td><td>675950</td><td>281</td><td>125</td><td>&euro;693,231.71</td><td>&euro;287,708.24</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>221</td><td>106</td><td>&euro;206,550</td><td>132800</td><td>246</td><td>43</td><td>&euro;660,772.45</td><td>&euro;114,314.42</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>264</td><td>220</td><td>&euro;194,300</td><td>173550</td><td>302</td><td>73</td><td>&euro;765,453.45</td><td>&euro;213,948.22</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>40</td><td>39</td><td>&euro;44,200</td><td>46600</td><td>47</td><td>46</td><td>&euro;157,928.00</td><td>&euro;160,317.50</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>1,010</td><td>893</td><td>&euro;916,553</td><td>766150</td><td>205</td><td>220</td><td>&euro;495,583.35</td><td>&euro;679,833.58</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>35</td><td>106</td><td>&euro;35,350</td><td>88650</td><td>88</td><td>43</td><td>&euro;206,281.37</td><td>&euro;100,779.92</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>494</td><td>492</td><td>&euro;457,218</td><td>431400</td><td>531</td><td>131</td><td>&euro;1,168,613.60</td><td>&euro;351,725.26</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>427</td><td>380</td><td>&euro;478,725</td><td>420625</td><td>290</td><td>429</td><td>&euro;860,382.82</td><td>&euro;1,421,361.74</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>635</td><td>555</td><td>&euro;671,600</td><td>533650</td><td>697</td><td>154</td><td>&euro;1,547,615.40</td><td>&euro;409,860.80</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>80</td><td>72</td><td>&euro;101,610</td><td>87400</td><td>45</td><td>29</td><td>&euro;129,734.56</td><td>&euro;88,527.33</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>154</td><td>172</td><td>&euro;134,300</td><td>167294.5</td><td>337</td><td>84</td><td>&euro;936,966.36</td><td>&euro;227,836.94</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>167</td><td>111</td><td>&euro;148,450</td><td>120250</td><td>82</td><td>60</td><td>&euro;257,299.39</td><td>&euro;224,390.29</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>123</td><td>96</td><td>&euro;157,100</td><td>157150</td><td>139</td><td>186</td><td>&euro;400,865.68</td><td>&euro;678,332.38</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>502</td><td>356</td><td>&euro;528,100</td><td>393460</td><td>203</td><td>272</td><td>&euro;513,978.76</td><td>&euro;772,701.50</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>420</td><td>311</td><td>&euro;466,511</td><td>342000</td><td>106</td><td>191</td><td>&euro;327,691.18</td><td>&euro;727,157.22</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>252</td><td>197</td><td>&euro;245,650</td><td>226150</td><td>182</td><td>106</td><td>&euro;510,732.62</td><td>&euro;371,669.12</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>508</td><td>457</td><td>&euro;416,950</td><td>380660</td><td>297</td><td>346</td><td>&euro;849,172.75</td><td>&euro;1,067,952.29</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>409</td><td>468</td><td>&euro;556,750</td><td>546450</td><td>438</td><td>110</td><td>&euro;977,271.23</td><td>&euro;347,581.21</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15,265</td><td>13,577</td><td>&euro;17,027,242</td><td>&euro;14,982,747.6</td><td>6839</td><td>5620</td><td>&euro;17,126,895.54</td><td>&euro;15,237,393.89</td></tr></table></p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme commended in 2016. It is funded by my Department and is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health.  It is operated by SEAI and the HSE.  The aim of the pilot is to provide deep energy efficiency interventions to people living with chronic respiratory conditions who are in or at risk of energy poverty.  By making their homes warmer, more comfortable and cheaper to run, it is hoped that this will improve their health and wellbeing.  The pilot scheme is currently operating in Dublin 8, 10, 12, 22 or 24.  In 2016 spend of &euro;0.5m helped upgrade 72 homes.  To date in 2017 spend of &euro;2.6m has upgraded 196 homes.  I expect that upgrades to 500 homes will have been completed by end year. </p><p>The Better Energy Community scheme cut across a variety of sectors, so it is not possible to give a strict breakdown of the scheme according to individual sectors.  Projects can also involve participants from more than one county.  Details of Better Energy Communities projects in 2016 and to date in 2017, their spend and their county location are set out in the following table. </p><p>The Deep Retrofit Pilot scheme commenced operation in 2017.  The scheme aims to help us understand how best we can persuade people to invest in the deep retrofit of their homes and what solutions we need to put in place to make it easy for them to do so.  To be eligible for support, a home must be upgraded to at least an A3 standard on the Building Energy Rating scale and the heating system must be upgraded to a renewable energy alternative.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>No. of homes</th></tr><tr><td>Co.

This provides the initial stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention.  Funding of &euro;75m has also been committed through the European Regional Development Fund.</p><p>Further funding will be required over the lifetime of the proposed 25 year contract to build, maintain and operate the broadband network in the State Intervention Area.  In this regard, the Programme for a Partnership Government (PfG) notes that Government will provide additional Exchequer capital, if needed, to deliver on the commitment to bring next generation broadband to every house and business in the country.</p><p>The budget allocation for the Department's work to deliver the State led Intervention for the time period requested is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Budget</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;10m</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;15m</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;15m (Projected)</td></tr></table></p><p>The NBP was launched in December 2012, and expenditure in respect of the State led Intervention therefore dates from 2013.The expenditure to date is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;394,507</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;686,864</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;3,001,761</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;2,360,136</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;8,211,568 (to date)</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department has allocated &euro;15 million to the Department's work on the State led Intervention for the NBP for 2018. </p><p>The procurement process being managed by the Department's specialist NBP team is a complex one and it is important that it is adequately resourced to ensure efficiency, robustness and transparency.However, delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority.</p></reply>

Therefore, it can be difficult to predict exactly how many vehicles will be supported in future years.  In May this year, the Government approved and published the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030.  This policy framework sets an ambitious target that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero emissions, or zero emissions capable.  </p><p>The National Policy Framework includes an indicative forecast of the numbers of alternative fuel vehicles at particular milestones up to 2030.  In the case of electric passenger cars, the projections indicate the potential for 20,000 cars by 2020 and 250,000 by 2025.  More detail, which includes projections for other vehicle types such as goods vehicles, buses and motorcycles, is contained in the framework document which is available on the website of the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport. </p><p>The ESB, through its eCars programme, has rolled out an extensive public network of charging points across Ireland.  With approximately 900 electric vehicle charge points, for a country of our size, we have one of the more comprehensive charge point networks in Europe.  It is estimated that <font color="#0D0D0D">the average cost of installing a fast charge point is circa &euro;50,000.  The cost of installing a standard charge point is estimated to be up to &euro;5,000.  The cost per unit can vary in price depending on the supplier and functionality of the charge point and the associated works for installing the charge point at a site.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It was established to accelerate the deployment of low carbon transport technologies, including electric vehicles.  </font></p><p>Since its formation, the Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce has been exploring the potential for further growth in the electric vehicle market and this has led to a package of measures in Budget 2018.  These measures include the continuation of the existing EV purchase grant and a new grant to support the installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs.  It is important that the public is aware of the supports available for electric vehicles.  That is why I have asked the SEAI to develop an EV Public Awareness Programme which will include an awareness campaign; a driver experience roadshow which will give people the opportunity to drive an EV and experience the benefits for themselves; public sector and commercial fleet trials; and supports for electric vehicle use in car sharing.</p></reply>

This support will be provided primarily for bilateral assistance in respect of climate change adaptation goals in developing countries and will come from the Vote of Irish Aid managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In addition, Ireland committed to commencing contributions to the Green Climate Fund in 2016 with a view to building up our support over the coming years.   In line with this commitment, which was subsequently reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government, an initial contribution to the Green Climate Fund of &euro;2 million was made from my Department's Vote in 2016. This was part of an overall amount of &euro;52.66 million provided by Ireland in public financial support to address climate change in developing countries in 2016.</p>  <p>  At the recent twenty-third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (UNFCCC COP 23), I announced that a further contribution of &euro;2 million would be made by the Government to the Green Climate Fund in 2017. This is part of a package of additional funding by my Department totalling &euro;2.5 million in 2017, which also includes support for the UNFCCC&rsquo;s Adaptation Fund, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the NDC Partnership. </p>  <p>  While no decisions have yet been taken in respect of contributions for 2018, any such decisions will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s commitments, referred to above, regarding building up its support to the Green Climate Fund in the coming years.</p></reply>

The review report did not recommend the introduction of a deposit and refund scheme and concluded that to establish such a scheme was inappropriate, in view of the operation of the existing successful packaging scheme (operated by Repak).  It also pointed to current policies concerning household waste collection and the high administrative costs of introducing such a system.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, on foot of a Private Members Bill tabled by Deputy Ryan recently, I have asked the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment to look at the merits of a deposit and refund scheme at a national level in the context of the associated costs and the contribution to the attainment of our national waste targets under EU legislation. I am awaiting the outcome of this before taking any further action. </p>  <p>I am not aware of estimates for the cost of operating a deposit and refund system for any packaging in Ireland.  However, a study carried out in Scotland on the subject estimates set-up and annual administration costs to be in the region of &pound;77 million.   </p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.    Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers - including in Counties Cavan and Monaghan - where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. In July 2016, I established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator. Three meetings of the Implementation Group have been held so far - on 8 March, 5 July and 22 November. </p>  <p>  This week I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. These reports show continuing progress and also the sustained level of engagement between actions owners and industry.  </p>  <p>  This engagement was clear in October at first National Stakeholder Forum in Athlone, which I hosted with Minister Kyne.  It arose from the Taskforce&rsquo;s recognition that, given the rapid technological change and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, stakeholders needed an opportunity to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services. Issues impacting on rollout were discussed at the Forum, and there were also some new recommended actions for the Taskforce to help improve services to consumers and in preparing for roll-out of the National Broadband Plan network, once contracts are in place. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:</p>  <p>  - Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer;  </p>  <p>  - Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies, including Government working closely with local authorities to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs to be connected at an early juncture after award of the NBP contract;</p>  <p>  - ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services. ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map. </p>  <p>  - Most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development. </p>  <p>  - Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out. TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms. </p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. </p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas such as Counties Cavan and Monaghan.</p></reply>

Nearly 19,000 (45%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be covered by commercial providers, while approximately 6,000 (15%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 33,000 premises in Monaghan. Just over 15,600 (47%) fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention. Nearly 14,000 (42%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be covered by commercial providers, while approximately 3,500 (11%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment.</p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team. The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature. </p>  <p>  As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and rollout.  My Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and the frustration for communities and businesses that do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises (including approximately 75,000 premises in Counties Cavan and Monaghan)  that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The wide ranging work of the Taskforce has been divided between three working groups addressing: Market Growth Stimuli and Visibility; Infrastructure, Energy Regulation and Pricing; and Planning Legislation, Building Regulations and Public Leadership.  As part of its programme of work, Working Group 1 of the Taskforce, which is chaired by my Department, is assessing options for potential Government and public body leadership initiatives and opportunities, as means of further demonstrating support for LEV uptake. To this end, Working Group 1 considered recently a TII paper on options for incentive toll rates for EV drivers. Although the modalities are still under consideration I have secured funding in Budget 2018 to introduce a toll incentive regime which I hope could be introduced early next year.  </p>  <p>  In relation to extending the cost of toll waivers to electric and hybrid vehicles, it is estimated based on 2015 figures that the average toll paying motorist pays &euro;100 in tolls per year. At current penetration levels of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road in Ireland and assuming a full toll waiver that would equate to a cost of approximately &euro;230,000 over the course of a full year. This full waiver cost would rise to an estimated &euro;2 million should the target level of 20,000 electric vehicles by 2020 be reached.</p></reply>

Across the EU there is no maximum weight 'norm' for such vehicles and a lacuna in Ireland's Construction and Use Regulations has meant that a maximum weight limit for such vehicles has hitherto remained unstipulated.</p>  <p>  It is precisely to correct this regulatory anomaly that Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority (RSA), were tasked with analysing the pavement wear effects of this 39 tonne variant, as well as the associated vehicle standard related requirements attaching to the operation of 5 axle rigids in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The results of TII's commissioned study concluded that, because of their shorter wheel base they impacted negatively on both our bridge infrastructure and pavements.  In circumstances, where in real terms, road maintenance funding has been severely cut over successive years, it was therefore recommended that the maximum regulatory weight limit for such vehicles should be set at 36 tonnes and will come into effect on 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  The results of TII's study were presented to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and other interested industry representative bodies.</p>  <p>  A regulatory exemption, subject to certain technical requirements and manufacturer approval, will however apply to those rigids with five (or more) axles which are in service before 1 January 2018.</p></reply>

My Department continues to work with and fund key stakeholders to address how road users behave on our roads in order to promote a safe and respectful approach from all users sharing the public road space.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority, which operates under the aegis of my Department, continues to do great work to get this important message across.  The RSA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cycle Smart, Cycle Safe&rsquo; campaign directly addressed safety issues for cyclists, including equipment check, Rules of the Road, sharing the road and proper signalling procedures.  The RSA continually addresses road safety issues for all road users - including raising awareness of how other road users should interact safely with cyclists - and it actively engages with a variety of key stakeholders across a wide range of media.</p>  <p>  Measures to ensure road safety in our communities include the Road Safety Act 2016 which created legislation to have a 20km/h speed limit, and I hope to see local authorities making use of this important new provision.  In 2015 on-the-spot fines were introduced for several cycling offences, including cycling &lsquo;without reasonable consideration&rsquo; and &lsquo;cycling in a pedestrianised street or area&rsquo;.  My Department also funds Cycle Right and the Green Schools Travel programmes, which help provide quality cycle training for children.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the key contribution that cycling can play as part of an integrated Public Transport strategy.  Census 2016 recorded a steep rise in the numbers cycling to work.  That growing trend will be catered for by providing a network of safe cycling facilities that will encourage increased numbers to adopt what is a convenient and healthy mode of transport.  As traffic levels rise in urban areas, cycling will play an increasing role in alleviating congestion and contributing to economic success.</p>  <p>  That can be supported by investment in high quality cycling infrastructure, and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as part of Budget 2018 I have secured increased allocations for safe cycling infrastructure over the period 2018-2021.  Over &euro;110m will now be available specifically for the development of cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area and Regional Cities over the next four years to provide safe alternative active travel routes to help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.  In addition, the considerable investment of about three-quarters of a billion euro for re-configuring the bus network and infrastructure over the coming years will also deliver the construction of significant new cycling facilities alongside bus routes on the key radial routes into the city centre and provide safe cycling arrangements, largely segregated from other traffic, along those corridors.  Some of the &euro;135m funding that will be provided to local authorities in the GDA and the Regional Cities for Sustainable Urban Transport will support better traffic management, bus priority measures and pedestrian infrastructure - which will benefit the safe and effective movement of all.  Finally, in the area of Greenways, in the recent Budget there was more than a doubling of the investment available up to 2021, with a capital allocation now of over &euro;55m to deliver Greenway projects.  All of these investments will contribute to a considerable improvement in the cycling infrastructure available over the next few years.</p></reply>

The original cost of the overall DART Expansion Programme (including the DART Underground Tunnel element) was estimated at &euro;4 billion, of which &euro;3 billion was in respect of the tunnel as originally designed.  The Government decided in September 2015 that the original proposal for the tunnel should be redesigned to provide a lower cost solution.  I understand that the NTA's work on this is expected to be completed soon.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s budgetary framework for capital investment, as set out in Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, was reviewed earlier this year in the context of the Mid-Term Review of capital priorities, delivery and funding.  Following this work, Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for public transport investment between 2018 and 2021.  This includes funding of about &euro;230 million for mainline rail and DART capacity enhancement.  This will enable acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART Expansion Programme, focussing particularly at this stage on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity, and extending the electrified DART system.  Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan - now expected to be delivered in 2022 - and the Maynooth line.  </p>  <p>  In light of the NTA&rsquo;s responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Authority for information in relation to expenditure in 2017 on the DART Expansion Programme.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

In these circumstances, services are encouraged to contact Pobal directly to consider what options are available to them.  Nonetheless, in accordance with the public spending rules applicable to the capital schemes, funding granted in 2017 must be spent in 2017 and therefore extensions beyond 31 December 2017 cannot be considered.</p>  <p>  In relation to the childcare service provider you mention, I have asked Pobal to contact them directly and liaise further on this matter.</p></reply>

As part of the Government's commitment to follow through on these actions, an Implementation Group was established earlier this year to oversee their delivery.  The Implementation Group is co-chaired by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Denis Naughten T.D., and the Minister for Community Development, Natural Resources &amp;amp; Digital Development, Sean Kyne, T.D.  </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations made by the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce was that each Local Authority should assign an officer with responsibility for broadband and mobile phone services. </p>  <p>  My Department provided funding of &euro;1.085 million (&euro;35,000 to each local authority) during 2017 to support the assignment by each Local Authority of a Broadband and Telecommunications Officer.  The remit of the Broadband and Telecommunications Officer is primarily to manage interactions with any company that is seeking to roll out telecommunications infrastructure in their county.  The Broadband and Telecommunications Officer will also work with the winning bidder(s) in respect of the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan in the areas to be covered by State intervention.</p>  <p>  Quarterly progress reports are published on the status of actions outlined in the Taskforce report, and a comprehensive annual review of 2017 progress will be completed in early 2018. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-29a.1119.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900091#WRZ04400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 478 and 479 together.</p>  <p>  The Community Services Programme (CSP) provides financial support to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a socially inclusive nature.  The CSP works on a social-enterprise model which means that it does not fully fund contract holders but requires that they generate revenue by charging fees or raising funds.  All CSP recipients are obliged to meet these criteria.  These social enterprises also remain responsible for their own budgets and financial liabilities. </p>  <p>  The defining characteristic of CSP services is that they are set up to provide social and economic value and are managed as going concerns with business and revenue targets set within a defined business plan.  In order to assist sustainability, all CSP service providers should strive for a situation where at least 30% of annual turnover is from traded income, and where the CSP grant is not more than 50% of annual turnover.  While this may not be achievable in the short-term for some service providers, it is something to focus on in the medium to long-term and business plans should be orientated towards the achievement of these benchmarks in terms of sustainability.</p>  <p>  Services must generate sufficient traded income to be viable and sustainable entities.  Services that do not generate sufficient traded income are unlikely to be effective and risk closure and loss of services to their local areas.</p>  <p>  The organisation referred to by the Deputy completed a business plan during 2016 as part of the CSP contract cycle.  The business plan was submitted to Pobal, which operates CSP on behalf of my Department.  Pobal has a proven track record in the administration of public funds and extensive experience in assessing funding applications and business plans.</p>  <p>  Pobal assessed this plan under the five standard criteria used - capacity, sustainability, value-for-money, demonstration of need and strategic fit.  Significant areas for concern were found with a number of aspects of the service.  These included the following:</p>  <p>  -  Capacity: there was limited information provided within the plan and it failed to make a clear business case; </p>  <p>-  Sustainability: while there has been a substantial drop in traded income by the organisation, there are no significant plans outlined to address this in the business plan.  Traded income is below the recommended standard of 30% and CSP income is now well above the recommended standard of 50%.  The organisation has provided very little information on how its board is dealing with this situation and no specific income-generating plans have been committed to;</p>  <p>  -  Demonstration of need: the evidence of need provided is considered weak and of poor quality; and</p>  <p>  -  Strategic Fit: there is little evidence of alignment to the CSP or social enterprise model.  The organisation stated that &ldquo;It is not a feasible project to have a traded income to support staff&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  As a result of this assessment, Pobal recommended that the service should exit the CSP at the end of June 2018 and this recommendation was approved by my Department.  The organisation was notified of the outcome of this process on 22 November 2016.  Funding is approved for 18 months up to 30 June 2018 at a level of one manager and two full-time equivalent positions (FTEs), after which the service is due to exit the CSP.</p>  <p>  The organisation was notified that it could appeal this decision no later than 22 December 2016 with details on the appeals procedure provided.  The organisation did not pursue this avenue and the time period for accepting an appeal has passed.</p>  <p>  It is open to the organisation to submit a new expression of interest in re-joining CSP in the future, but I would urge them to work closely with their local Pobal representatives before doing so.  Any new proposal would need to meet the criteria for the CSP before being approved to go forward to business planning.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A Memorandum of Agreement for the contract period is completed annually by both my Department and the sponsoring organisations (called Managing Agents) and my Department provides financial funding to schemes towards administration costs, participant and supervisor wages.</p>  <p>  Recruitment to JI effectively ceased with effect from 10 November 2004 when the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced that, following a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes, there would be no compulsory lay-offs from JI and that those on JI would have their contracts renewed.  This had the result that those already working on the scheme could remain on JI until they either resigned voluntarily or reached retirement age.  However, employees have an obligation to fulfil the terms of their employment contracts and abide by the Managing Agents&rsquo; procedures.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the JI scheme and participants will continue to renew their contracts on an annual basis, as required under the JI guidelines. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-29a.1133.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900092#WRAA01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 484 to 486, inclusive, and 490 together.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, JobPath is a service that supports people who are long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.  The service commenced operations in mid-2015, and reached full State-wide delivery of the service in July 2016.</p>  <p>  Some 65,000 Clients commenced their engagement with the service between January 1st &amp;amp; Dec 31st 2016.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of participants to find full time employment, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months: under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.  </p>  <p>  It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  The Department has, however, commenced publishing initial cohort reports on the performance of the service.  The last report can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website.  I can confirm that the next report will be published within the next two weeks.  </p>  <p>  The most recent cohort report published on the Department&rsquo;s website indicates that 19% of Jobseekers who engaged with JobPath between July 2015 and March 2016 entered full time employment (this was 36% above the weighted reference performance rate of 14%), 4% of participants entered part time employment and a further 3% entered Self-employment.  Overall 26% of JobPath participants within this period had an employment outcome.  In addition, this report also shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were up to 34% more likely to find a job than those who did not.  It is important to note that the outcomes for each cohort are updated every time these reports are published, to take account of outcomes that have been validated since the last publication date.  </p>  <p>  While the indications are positive, these initial reports are subject to review and are based on a small sample size and should be treated with caution.  </p>  <p>  An in-depth evaluation of the JobPath strand of the Department&rsquo;s activation service has commenced data gathering.  Completion of the evaluation is provisionally scheduled for the end of Quarter 3, 2018.  </p>  <p>  JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies.  The companies are paid on the basis of performance and with the exception of the initial registration fee; payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  The registration fee may be claimed once a jobseeker has developed a Personal Progression Plan (PPP).  Job Sustainment Fees (JSF) are payable for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).  </p>  <p>  The overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who participate in the programme and the number who get sustainable jobs.  </p>  <p>  It is not intended to publish the details of payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive.  The commercial sensitivity is specifically in relation to the release of information which has the potential to influence the pricing of future contracts providing a similar service, and thereby conferring commercial advantage on one bidder over another.  </p>  <p>  The total amount paid in fees to the two companies in 2016 was &euro;25.2m.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

It is therefore not possible to predict an individual&rsquo;s state pension (contributory) entitlement.  Eligibility is examined by a Deciding Officer following receipt of a completed application.  According to the records of the Department, the person concerned will not reach pension age until 19 December 2018.  The person should submit an application for pension at least 3 months in advance of that date.  </p>  <p>  A person who ceases insurable employment before reaching state pension age should, where possible, maintain their insurance record.  Where an individual wishes to consider payment of voluntary contributions, in order to maintain their paid contributions insurance record, they should contact the Department&rsquo;s Voluntary Contributions Section, Cork Road, Waterford.  </p>  <p>  It is also open to any individual approaching pension age to apply for state pension (non-contributory).  This is a means tested payment and not reliant on a social insurance contribution record.  On receipt of a completed state pension (non-contributory) application, the person&rsquo;s entitlement will be assessed and they will be notified of the outcome.   Where an individual qualifies for both pensions, the more financially beneficial rate will be paid.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Participants on CE work for 19&frac12; hours per week.  Work opportunities are within communities and, in the main, support the provision of valuable community services in areas of disadvantage.  </p><p>Following the publication earlier in the year of my Department&rsquo;s Report &ndash; <i>An Analysis of the Community Employment Programme</i>&ndash; the Government approved a number of changes to the terms and conditions around participation on CE.  In this context, a number of changes to the CE programme were introduced from 3 July 2017.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme.  </p><p>In addition the report recommends that all CE places should be categorised into one of two strands, either activation or social inclusion.  The purpose of this categorisation is to acknowledge that not all CE places are the same with some places providing an opportunity for those who are very distant from the labour market to work and deliver services in their local communities.  </p><p>Other places are more directly related to employment opportunities with participants getting more labour market relevant work experience.  In general, each CE scheme will have a mix<b></b>of both activation and social inclusion places.  The target progression rate for activation places is set at 50%, given their closer links to job opportunities, while the target progression rate for social inclusion places is set at 20%.  In terms of measuring the performance of CE schemes in terms of the progression of participants, regard will be had for local labour market conditions and the training and education opportunities available.  </p><p>Overall, my Department is conscious of the valuable contribution the schemes are making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension is being extended to the self-employed from 1st December 2017.  </p><p>This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.5% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.75% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.5% or 14.75%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.  </p><p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18<sup>th</sup>October 2017.  The Review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.  </p><p>The Review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers will be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the Actuarial Review.  </p><p>As part of the Review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.  </p><p>The Review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p><p>It should be noted that the projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.  The following table gives a breakdown of the costs of the individual benefits.  </p><p><b>Projected costs of extending Invalidity, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Benefits</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Invalidity</th><th>Illness</th><th>Jobseeker&rsquo;s</th><th>Carer&rsquo;s</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2015 (act)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>59</td><td>54</td><td>58</td><td>3</td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>87</td><td>72</td><td>60</td><td>4</td><td>223</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>125</td><td>88</td><td>63</td><td>5</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>152</td><td>94</td><td>67</td><td>5</td><td>317</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>176</td><td>99</td><td>71</td><td>5</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>198</td><td>104</td><td>75</td><td>6</td><td>382</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>218</td><td>108</td><td>81</td><td>6</td><td>413</td></tr></table></p><p>The Review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the Exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.  </p><p>This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension (contributory).  </p><p>The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.  </p><p>The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the Social Insurance Fund in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.  </p></reply>

Recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2017 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;83 million on the farm assist scheme.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 fully reversed the previous cuts to the Farm Assist means test.  The changes included that 70% of farm income is now be assessed as means, down from 100% being assessed as means (which is equivalent to a 30% income disregard) and an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children.  </p>  <p>  The farm assist means test is flexible so as to allow for significant income fluctuations from one year to the next.  It may also be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC) schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  With regard to this income the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded, and then 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded - with the balance being assessed as means.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of changing the farm assist means testing rules in order that irrespective of the source of income the first &euro;3,000 would be disregarded and the balance would be means tested at 50% is approximately &euro;15 million for a full year.  This estimate is based on the existing number of recipients and current rates.  </p>  <p>  However, it is envisaged that there would be an inflow of new farm assist claims if these measures were introduced.  The Department cannot quantify the numbers involved and as such cannot calculate the associated additional costs.  Therefore, the estimated cost of &euro;15 million should be regarded as a minimum estimate.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided for a &euro;5 per week increase in rate of payment for farm assist which will see the maximum rate increased from &euro;193 to &euro;198 per week from 26 March 2018.  </p>  <p>  Any changes to means assessment would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  </p></reply>

The changes to the form have been finalised following consultation with Family Carer&rsquo;s Ireland and carer representatives.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that applications are processed as soon as possible.

Under this approach, the rate of pension paid would more closely reflect the total number of Social Insurance contributions made by a person throughout her or his working life and the incongruities of the Yearly Averaging method of calculating entitlement would be removed. </p>  <p>  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020.  I intend that its design will include significant homemaker&rsquo;s provisions to assist those pensioners who spent considerable periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  </p>  <p>  A proposal for the precise method of how the Total Contributions Approach will be implemented is currently being finalised by officials in my Department, having recently received the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2015.  When this has been finalised, I intend to consult with relevant stakeholders before a decision in made on the final proposal by Government.  That proposal will then be subject to the legislative process, and which may result in further changes.</p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s strategic aim as set out in Rebuilding Ireland is to transfer all long-term rent supplement tenancies to HAP by 2020, with rent supplement reverting to its original purpose that of a short-term income support.  Since HAP&rsquo;s introduction it has been the main driver for rent supplement&rsquo;s customer base decline with over 30,000 tenants currently in receipt of HAP support.

Overall youth unemployment has fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 to well below the EU average of 16.6% in September 2017 (latest Eurostat data available).</p><p>Youth unemployment statistics from the QNHS are not available at the county level. </p><p>Administrative data from the Live Register include, as well as people who are unemployed, others who are working part-time or on a casual basis and receiving partial jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  They may nonetheless give some indication of the trend in, if not the level of, youth unemployment, and are available at the county level.  The number of young people signing on at DEASP offices in each county in October 2012 and October 2017 is set out in Table 1 below.</p><p><b>Table 1.

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. </p><p>The overall reduction in youth unemployment, and the indications from the Live Register that this improvement has been spread widely across the country, suggests that this approach has been relatively successful.</p><p>I am confident these policies, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p></reply>

These include the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) payment where the youngest child is aged 7-13 years and the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment which may be paid to lone parents where the youngest child is aged 14 or over.  The Family Income Supplement, which is being re-designated as a Working Family Payment (WFP) is also available to lone parents who are working 19 or more hours per week.  Lone parents who move to FIS/WFP can also apply for the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD).</p>  <p>  In addition to these income supports lone parents also have access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and the associated training, education and employment supports to assist them towards employment and financial independence.  A lone parent who seeks ongoing income support from the Department may receive a one to one meeting with a case officer from the Department who assists them to produce a personal development plan and guides them towards appropriate education, and employment opportunities.  While the customer is on the JST payment access to these supports is available, potentially for up to seven years.  This is a much broader support than the 12 month engagement that normally applies for jobseekers from their one to one meeting.  The aim of this broader support is to improve the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects.  </p>  <p>  The income and activation supports outlined above combine to ensure that there are effective resources available to lone parents.  </p></reply>

As such, the changes did not preclude any pensioner who would have qualified for a full State Pension (contributory) pre-2012 from qualifying for a full rate after September 2012.</p>  <p>  The current rate bands were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.   The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who both had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EU countries.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Firstly, by reversing the amendments made to the OFP scheme, this would likely result in a substantial cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible and therefore moving onto a social welfare payment.  As members of this cohort are not currently in receipt of any social welfare payment, the Department currently has no visibility of them and therefore, it would be impossible to estimate the numbers involved. </p>  <p>  Secondly, this proposal may incentivise some customers to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back onto the OFP. It would not be possible for the Department to estimate the magnitude of this flow between schemes. </p>  <p>  Finally, reversing the changes to the OFP would also increase the incidence of dual payments of OFP and the Family Income Supplement (FIS), which would lead to significant but unquantifiable reductions in FIS payments for some lone parents. </p>  <p>  These unknown factors are critical to providing a reliable costing.  The Department is therefore not in a position to provide the costing requested. </p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.   This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  We are all aware that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by roughly &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (although at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been a number of Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of over &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 28,858, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 28,858 such grants made in 2018, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be &euro;24.53 million.</p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Since the commencement of the scheme on 1 September 2016, 28,969 paternity benefit claims have been awarded to 31 October 2017.</p><p>The estimated additional cost of extending the duration of paternity benefit is approximately &euro;5.5 million for each extra week. The table below estimates the additional cost of increasing the duration of paternity benefit above its current 2 week duration at the current weekly rate of &euro;235.  It should be noted that Budget 2018 provides for the weekly rate of payment to be increased by &euro;5 per week from 26 March 2018.</p><p><b>Estimated annual cost of increasing the duration of Paternity Benefit based on 2017 rates</b><table><tr><th>No. of additional weeks</th><th>Estimated cost (&euro;m)</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>5.5</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>11.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>16.5</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>22.0</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>27.5</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>33.0</td></tr></table>These estimates are based on the cost for a full year and assume that any increase in duration is implemented from the beginning of the year.The cost in the first year would depend on the implementation date that the increase in duration would take effect.  This cost would be proportional to the full year cost.</p><p>It should be noted that this costing is subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2017.  It should also be noted that there are also costs to the Exchequer as these estimates do not include the costs of salary top-ups for public/civil servants.</p></reply>

Under that Act, a housing authority may request information from the owner or occupier of a house such as will allow that authority to determine if a house can be deemed to be overcrowded, having regard to section 63 of the Act. </p>  <p>  The housing authority may serve notice on the owner of a house specifying the maximum number of persons that may occupy a house without causing overcrowding and, where the owner of a house is causing or permitting the house to be overcrowded, may require the owner to desist from causing or permitting such overcrowding within a period not exceeding 21 days. </p>  <p>  Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with these requirements is guilty of an offence. Overcrowding may give rise to concerns in respect of fire safety, and may lead to enforcement action by fire authorities.  Situations of overcrowding should be reported to the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  I will shortly be introducing changes to legislation to require landlords, when registering a tenancy with the RTB, to certify that the property in question is compliant with regulations in relation to standards for rental accommodation, overcrowding and fire safety. This will mean a legally enforceable requirement on landlords to certify the quality and safety of their rental properties.  Failure to provide this certification, failure to register the tenancy or, very importantly, the provision of an untrue certification, will all constitute offences, prosecutable by the RTB. </p>  <p>  The RTB will play a key role in terms of standards and enforcement in the rental sector, and will be given the powers and the resources required to take on this enhanced regulatory responsibility. I have previously stated that this will entail a substantial programme of work that would need to be undertaken over a number of years.  However, priority is being given to exploring, as a matter of urgency, the changes needed in legislation and in the Board&rsquo;s financing arrangements in order to make early progress in the process that will progressively see the RTB become the sector&rsquo;s regulator over the next two years. </p>  <p>  Particular attention will be given to possible amendments to the provisions in relation to overcrowding, both in terms of its legal definition and the enforcement actions and sanctions applicable to such situations. </p></reply>

The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, including any exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate, are therefore determined at local authority level, in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this regard.</p>  <p>  The majority of development contribution schemes adopted by local authorities currently provide for charges in respect of telecommunications infrastructure development within their functional areas. I understand that, as of November 2017, the development contribution schemes of 17 local authorities include a specific charge for telecommunications infrastructure development. 13 local authorities do not include a specific charge for telecommunications infrastructure in their schemes. 1 local authority includes a specific charge for telecommunication infrastructure in their current scheme; however the amount of contribution charged has in practice since been revised to zero. </p>  <p>  For the purpose of supporting and incentivising economic development, including the roll-out of broadband infrastructure, my Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act on the implementation of development contribution schemes, which included a requirement that local authorities include a specific waiver for broadband infrastructure (masts and antennae) in their schemes. Most development contribution schemes adopted by planning authorities currently provide for such waivers. In this regard, 23 local authorities have adopted schemes which include a full exemption. Five local authorities do not specify a waiver for such infrastructure in their current scheme; however, as there is no provision included in their current schemes to charge for telecommunications infrastructure generally, the practice adopted is not to do so.  My Department has been engaging with the remaining three local authorities regarding the incorporation of explicit waivers in their schemes, one of which, as mentioned above, has in any event revised the development contribution charged for telecommunications infrastructure generally under their current scheme to zero.</p></reply>

Of the vacant properties where the enumerators indicated that the reason for vacancy was due to the property owner being deceased, it was not possible to ascertain if the property was the subject of any processing delays in the Probate Office.</p>  <p>  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the levels of vacancy recorded as part of Census 2016 have significantly reduced in the interim, particularly in urban areas where many habitable homes and buildings have since been occupied.</p></reply>

My Department recoups the cost of the land to the local authority once the land in question is utilised for the purposes of a social housing construction project.</p>  <p>  The data in respect of funding for land costs for each social housing construction project on a local authority basis over the period 2007 to 2017 is not readily available and its extraction would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that an approximation of the average land cost per unit of social housing delivered can be established through a comparison of average construction costs per unit and all-in costs per unit.  Assuming a weighted average mix of 1, 2, 3 and 4 bed units, the average construction cost per unit would be &euro;160,500 approximately, while the average all-in cost per unit would be approximately &euro;202,000.  However, it should be noted that while land costs account for the majority of the difference between the construction and all-in costs figures, the latter also includes other costs such as design team fees, utilities, site investigations, surveys etc.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>The terms of the Scheme involve discounts of 40%, 50% or 60% off the purchase price of the house, linked to the tenant&rsquo;s reckonable annual income.  On the sale of a house under the Scheme, the local authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount involved, as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Reckonable Annual Income</th><th>Discount</th><th>Charge period</th></tr><tr><td>Between  &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000</td><td>60%</td><td>30 years</td></tr><tr><td>Between  &euro;20,001 and &euro;29,999</td><td>50%</td><td>25 years</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 or more</td><td>40%</td><td>20 years</td></tr></table>In line with the commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.  The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p><p>The review is now complete and a full report setting out findings and recommendations has been prepared.  I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

The Water Services Strategic Plan - A Plan for the Future of Water Services (WSSP), which was published in October 2015, set out strategic objectives for the delivery of water services for 25 years up to 2040.  The WSSP committed to the preparation of Business Plans by Irish Water to set out targets for delivery of efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure and performance targets consistent with the delivery of the objectives of the WSSP. </p>  <p>  The Irish Water Business Plan - Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 was published in late 2015.  It set the priorities for the utility to 2021 and underpins the transformation plan for the water sector to a single utility model.  The plan was considered by Government and was approved subject to budgetary and regulatory review.  The Water Services Act 2017 contains provisions for the establishment of a Water Advisory Body (WAB).  The WAB is being established to advise on measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water.  The body will report on a quarterly basis to an Oireachtas Committee on the performance of Irish Water on the implementation of its business plan.</p>  <p>  The Confidence and Supply Arrangement in support of the minority Government has confirmed the retention of Irish Water as a single national utility in public ownership, responsible for the delivery of water and waste water services.  </p>  <p>  Since 2013, working through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with the local authorities, Irish Water has made significant progress in establishing the utility capability, which has included investing over &euro;2 billion in the system to date.  Over the past year, significant design phase work has been undertaken on the development of a transformation plan, in line with the Business Plan objectives.  Flowing from this, I have been informed by Ervia (which has responsibility for Irish Water), that they consider that the public water system will benefit significantly by greater integration of operations into the single utility.  Consequently, the Ervia Board has agreed in principle not to renew the SLAs beyond 2025 when they are due to end, and to move to a full integrated public utility operations model.  The Water Services Acts already provide the necessary protections for terms and conditions, and pensions, of local authority staff working under the SLAs in such circumstances.  It is the intention of Ervia to work with local authorities to manage this change within the life of the current Business Plan (i.e. by end of 2021). </p>  <p>  A process of engagement with local authorities on the proposed next steps on the transformation plan has now commenced.  The SLAs between Irish Water and local authorities have not been amended and remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed. </p></reply>

social housing through Part V and refurbished properties/Voids, together with some 6,500 acquisitions, over the period 2016 to 2021. </p><p>I will shortly be issuing new targets for social housing

In this context, it is important that an appropriate balance is maintained between personnel costs and equipment investment.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for a Permanent Defence Force Establishment of 9,500 personnel and as at 31st October 2017 (the latest date for which figures are available) the strength of the PDF was 9,219 personnel.  The Defence Budget for 2017 provides for a full strength of 9,500 personnel and every effort is being made to reach this strength.  With regard to equipment and infrastructure, I was pleased to have recently secured additional capital funding of &euro;98 million over the balance of the timeframe for the Capital Investment Programme 2016&ndash;2021 which will contribute to meeting equipment and infrastructure requirements. </p>  <p>  Apart from the White Paper targets, the Department does not maintain costings for increasing the strength of the PDF to those outlined by the Deputy.

The health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces are a priority for me and I will continue to seek updates on this important matter. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the White Paper a range of projects are under way which are examining capability requirements across the Defence Forces.
