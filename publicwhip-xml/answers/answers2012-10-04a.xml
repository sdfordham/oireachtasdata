    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-04a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100400045#WRA00500"><p>Last year, the Government established a Fiscal Advisory Council which is to, <i>inter alia, </i>assess and report periodically on the official macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts.  The Council issued its third Fiscal Assessment report in September 2012.  A large part of the report was devoted to assessing the appropriateness of the economic and budgetary forecasts of the Department of Finance. As the Council notes, economic and budgetary forecasts are subject to a degree of uncertainty and this is reflected in the wide range of projections and ongoing revisions. However, the findings of the Council are that the forecasts produced within the Department of Finance show no sign of optimism bias.  This is one of the key conclusions of the report, and is evident for all to see.  To quote from page 15 of the report,<i> &quot;....... the official forecasts do not exhibit evidence of optimism bias.&quot;</i></p><p>  The Fiscal Advisory Council notes that forecasts of the timing and magnitude of the recovery have been revised down by my Department in recent years, but also notes that similar revisions have been made by all institutions which forecast the Irish economy. The recovery in the global economy - on which we rely for an acceleration of export growth - has, in recent years, proved weaker than initial expectations of a number of international forecasting agencies such as the IMF and OECD.  </p><p>  I am sure the deputy is familiar with the March 2011 report on Strengthening the Capacity of the Department of Finance, carried out by Canadian expert Rob Wright.  It recognised that the Department&#8217;s forecasting record was as good as any other institution engaged in the process. Nonetheless, the Department has taken steps over the last eighteen months to improve its capacity in the economics field. New graduate staff with economics qualifications to MSc level have been recruited and a separate Economics Division has been set up.  </p><p>  My Department will publish its next set of economic and fiscal forecasts later this month to allow an informed debate in advance of December&#8217;s Budget on the fiscal space the government will be operating within.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-04a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100400045#WRA00700"><p>On 16th March 2011 the European Commission, which has the right of initiative to bring forward legislative proposals, published its proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.   This represented the beginning of a process that involves a detailed examination of the proposal, line by line, by all Member States at the Council Working Group. Since the Commission's proposal has been published, Department of Finance officials, along with officials from the Revenue Commissioners have been attending the Working Party on Tax Questions which is the forum for discussions on the proposal. To date, my officials have attended meetings on a regular basis in relation to the proposal and there is still a long way to go before agreement on the Commission's proposal could be expected.</p><p>  This proposal has the potential to affect the economic interests of all Member States. Therefore both I and the Government have made it clear that Ireland, like all other Member States, intends to constructively engage in that process because only in that way can we absolutely ensure that all of the arguments are brought to the table and our interests are protected. </p><p>  I want to assure the Deputy that it is clearly understood that our engagement is strictly on the basis that taxation is a matter of national competence and that the principle of unanimity in taxation is fully respected.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-04a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100400045#WRA00900"><p>I do not agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that there has been a failure to encourage the pillar banks to lend in adequate amount to meet demand in the economy. The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets and I would be confident of them achieving the more challenging target this year.   In terms of rejection rates from banks, I would remind the Deputy that the Credit Review Office (CRO) can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &euro;1,000 up to &euro;500,000. The CRO is overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and I would appeal to SMEs and farmers who have been refused credit by the banks to avail of the services of the CRO.</p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act provides for a scheme which will facilitate up to &euro;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  Furthermore, the Government is in the process of facilitating up to &euro;150m per annum of additional credit through the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, designed for SME&rsquo;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.</p><p>  In summary, it is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed. I remain open to any constructive suggestions which could augment the Government&rsquo;s initiatives in this area.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-04a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100400045#WRA01100"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently reviewing the Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General for 2011, published on Thursday, September 27th, which contains a comprehensive section on Revenue.  Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by filing the required tax return and paying the right amount of tax on time.  Revenue&#8217;s overall compliance strategy is to influence compliance behaviour in the community in general, including by making it as easy as possible for people to comply. In that regard, the Deputy will be aware of Ireland&#8217;s high ranking in a World Bank/PSC index on ease of payment of business taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners also actively support compliance by reducing the administrative burden on businesses. A measurement carried out recently in accordance with the internationally accepted Standard Cost Model, and overseen and validated by external consultants showed a reduction of 25% in the compliance cost burden for business.</p><p>  Some examples of initiatives that Revenue has delivered to support tax compliance include:</p><p>-  The development of its well-regarded Revenue&#8217;s Online Service (ROS), incorporating the electronic filing of tax returns and tax payment.  Its usage continues to grow (with increased use of Electronic Funds Transfer for tax payments). The number of payment transactions made via ROS increased by 35.6% in 2011 to 975,105, while the value of those payments increased by 16% to &#8364;32.1bn.</p><p>-  The extension of mandatory electronic Filing &#8211; which now incorporates all public sector bodies, all VAT registered businesses and employers that employ more than 10 people</p><p>-  The introduction of electronic Relevant Contracts Tax from January 1 2012 which, by streamlining processes has also had a very significant compliance impact:.  This project</p><p>-  Reduced the administrative burden on business and Revenue,</p><p>-  Streamlined and modernised the administration of Relevant Contracts Tax </p><p>-   Enhanced tax compliance,</p><p>-   Reduced the opportunities for fraud, </p><p>-   Improved cash flow for compliant subcontractors, and</p><p>-   Removed approximately 1,000,000 pieces of paper from the system.</p><p>-   Principal contractors now electronically inform the Revenue Commissioners of the payments made and the associated tax implications.</p><p>  It is international best practice amongst tax administrations that making it easy to comply with tax obligations encourages good compliance and I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are to the forefront in that approach.  The following statistics are indicators of the achievements of the Revenue Commissioners in 2011 through its strategy of encouraging voluntary compliance:</p><p><b>-</b> A 95% Return and Payment Compliance for Large Cases by the Due Month,</p><p><b>-</b>  A 95% average of tax collected by the due date for PAYE/PRSI,</p><p><b>-</b>  A 91% average of tax collected by the due date for VAT, and</p><p><b>-</b>  A 97% average of tax collected by the due date for Preliminary Income Tax (non-PAYE).</p><p>The other aspect of Revenue&#8217;s strategy to maximise tax compliance is the development of a comprehensive compliance programme.  Here Revenue&#8217;s approach is to undertake a range of compliance interventions that are the most appropriate to target the specific risk or risks identified and to influence the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer by so doing.  By carefully selecting the cases for intervention, and carefully choosing the type of intervention, Revenue strives to maximise the use of resources and minimise the compliance burden on compliant taxpayers<i>. </i>   In his 2011 Report, the C&amp;AG noted &#8216;that Revenue&#8217;s risk assessment is relatively effective in targeting higher-risk cases&#8217;.</p><p>  Among the outcomes that Revenue&#8217;s compliance activities have delivered for 2011 are the following:</p><p><b>- </b> In excess of 11,000 audits completed generating a yield of &#8364;440.5m,</p><p><b>-</b>  A further &#8364;81.3m collected from other assurance checks,</p><p><b>-</b>  16 convictions for serious tax offences, and</p><p><b>-</b>  366 published audit settlements to a value of &#8364;76m.</p><p>  It is now widely accepted by Revenue administrations that there is no one absolute way to measure changes in compliance levels. Most modern administrations use a number of indicators that can be looked at as a package, to help them form a view on whether compliance levels are improving or otherwise.  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing programmes that maximise voluntary compliance and deal in a very determined way with tax non-compliance.</p></reply>

One of these building blocks is an integrated financial framework or banking union which comprises three elements (a) an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks (b) a European deposit insurance scheme, and (c) a European resolution scheme.  The Euro Area Summit also on 29 June called on the Commission to quickly present proposals for the setting up of a single supervisory mechanism which would be considered by the Council as a matter of urgency. Significantly the statement of the Euro area Summit clearly stated that when such a mechanism is in place for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly.<b></b>  The statement also committed the Eurogroup to examining the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of our well-performing adjustment programme.</p><p>  The Commission presented legislative proposals in September for a single supervisory mechanism conferring powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis. </p><p>  Ireland supports in principle the development of a banking union for Europe.  Our support for a single supervisor is contingent on such a system definitively breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector. We are also seeking to ensure that shared supervision is progressed as part of a package which will also address shared risk and mutualisation of debt. The question of retrospective application of ESM remains firmly on the table as far as Ireland is concerned and we would expect to see more detail on how this can be addressed over the coming months. Any move to a banking union must respect the integrity of the single market and be consistent with the principle of free movement of capital throughout the European Union.</p><p>  The Commission called on the Council and European Parliament to adopt the legislative proposal by the end of 2012. While the timetable is ambitious we will be supporting efforts by the European Council to meet this target. </p><p>  The establishment of the single supervisory mechanism is a crucial and significant first step to completing the banking union. The banking union will also require further work to develop a common system for deposit guarantees and an integrated crisis management framework. </p></reply>

Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as set out in the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the bank. This Framework was published on 30 March 2012 and can be found on my department&#8217;s website. (<i></i>).   Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of the bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to the bank, including deposit pricing, is under pressure. Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. </p><p>  The Government and BOI are acutely aware of the social and economic impacts that any lending rate increases may have in the current environment. However, the bank has informed me that the majority of its lending products are currently priced on a par with their peers, with interest rate increases required in order to return the Bank to profitability and long term viability. </p></reply>

These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at; <i></i>.   Per the Relationship Framework with AIB, &#8220;the Minister will continue to work with the Board to strengthen its membership through the appointment of suitably qualified, independent non-executives&#8221;. In this regard, the Board is expected to consult with the Minister in respect of any Board appointments that it proposes.</p><p>  The process for independent non-executives selection involves the relevant board of AIB identifying what vacancies they have and the relevant skills they require.  To help facilitate the selection process, the Department of Finance placed advertisements in the national papers during 2011 seeking expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons for inclusion among those to be appointed or nominated to the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. This formed part of the commitments given in the Programme for Government. The bank considers potential candidates from this group, as well as from other sources. </p><p>  With respects to the individual whose details were supplied in this PQ, I was informed that he passed the Central Bank of Ireland&#8217;s Fitness and Probity (F&amp;P) Review.

The Commission was of the opinion that tax expenditures should be the subject of ongoing evaluation and appropriate and timely cost benefit analysis. This is to ensure that they are both economically efficient and that parliamentary oversight can be well informed.   However, there is an underlying principle of proportionality in cost benefit analysis. In other words - the level of resources invested in carrying out the analysis should be commensurate with the scale of the expenditure involved. </p><p>  In addition sufficient time is needed to undertake the analysis required for various measures.  </p><p>  An example of such work recently conducted by my Department would be the Economic Impact Assessment of Potential Changes to Legacy Property Reliefs. This assessment, undertaken last year and published by my Department, included a consultation paper, engagement from over 700 submissions and an analysis, enabled the Department to understand the possible legacy costs to the State as well as the impacts on individuals and economic sectors of a change in law relating to the use of these particular reliefs. </p><p>  Another example, which is currently work in progress, is the Public Consultation on Section 481 Film Tax Relief.  I published a consultation paper which set out preliminary analysis and data and invited interested parties to make submissions as part of an economic impact assessment of film tax relief. The impact assessment will enable the Department to better understand the benefits that may accrue to the exchequer as well as consequences for investors, the audiovisual industry, and the wider economy arising from potential changes to the relief. </p><p>  Such approaches provide a transparent and comprehensive process in line with best international practice for policy evaluation.</p><p>  I would note further that costs of tax credits, allowances and reliefs are provided by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in their Annual Statistical Reports. The most recent figures related to tax expenditures appear in the 2010 report, which sets out the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer of all income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available for 2008 and 2009, the most recent year for which information is available. The work of updating cost details for the following year is well advanced and Revenue hope to be in a position to publish them in the near future. </p><p>Finally, I would advise the Deputy that all tax reliefs are kept under review and as a matter of course form part of the Tax Strategy Group&#8217;s (TSG) discussions in advance of the Budget. The TSG papers are subsequently published on the Department of Finance&#8217;s tax policy website:   <i>www.taxpolicy.gov.ie.</i></p></reply>

The Commission recommended that the credit union sector should be restructured on a voluntary, time-bound and incentivised basis and that the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) should be established to facilitate and oversee the restructuring process. </p><p>  The Credit Union Bill 2012 was published on 28 September 2012 and implements over 60 of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  The Bill makes provision for the establishment of ReBo on a statutory basis and sets out the functions of the board and staff of ReBo.   This new legislation also provides the basis for the restructuring of the sector over time in a way that is stable and protects credit union members.</p><p>  I want to ensure that progress on restructuring is not delayed pending enactment of the Credit Union Bill and so I have established the Board of ReBo on an administrative basis in the meantime.  The Board consists of 13 members and its composition reflects the recommendation in the Commission report, comprising five independent members as well as members from credit union representative bodies, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. The Board was established on 31 August 2012 and held its first meeting on 28 September 2012.  </p><p>  The first phase of ReBo&rsquo;s work will involve undertaking preliminary engagement with credit unions during Quarter 4 of 2012. I am pleased that progress is in line with the timeline as set out by the Commission on Credit Unions.	</p></reply>

As I stated on Budget day, the primary purpose of the Budget was to support the creation and retention of jobs in the short-, medium- and long-term.    It should be acknowledged that while restoring the public finances to a sound footing is crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s future, consolidation can have a negative short-run impact on the economy.  However, it is the framing of this consolidation which is important and I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is conscious of the need to minimise the impact of consolidation on the labour market.</p><p>  I would like to point out that employment data are presented in net terms and information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available. This unfortunately makes it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative.  </p><p>  Having said that, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that there are tentative signs of stabilisation in labour market conditions, albeit at a very weak level. For instance, the latest data from the Live Register show an annual decrease of 8,106 (-1.9%) people on the Live Register in September. </p><p>  So leaving aside the fact that quantifying the impact is difficult, I am confident that the measures targeted at job creation for the different sectors of the economy in Budget 2012, as well as the measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative and the Action Plan for Jobs, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value-added tourism sector, are playing an important role in both creating and sustaining employment.</p><p>  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the labour market difficulties remains the Governments biggest challenge and, accordingly, Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.</p></reply>

This forms part of a long term policy to broaden the tax base, to provide a stable funding base for local government and to assist the strengthening of democracy at local level.  A Bill to introduce the tax will be published with the forthcoming Budget.  </p><p>  The Government does not propose at this time to introduce a wealth tax, although all taxes and potential taxation options are constantly reviewed.  </p><p>  Asset values increase and decrease over time and in the context of recent economic circumstances, they may have declined considerably in many cases. Thus, if the value of an asset or of an individual&#8217;s wealth is measured at a particular time there is no guarantee that the asset value or the individual&#8217;s wealth will remain at that level or increase from that point.  This would make it difficult to predict the potential yield from a wealth tax and would have to be borne in mind in terms of its consistency as a source of revenue.  Although property valuations have also experienced much fluctuation in recent years, international experience shows that an annual recurring property tax is a stable source of revenue and is therefore an important base-broadening measure for the Irish tax system.</p><p>  To estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, we would need to identify the wealth held by individuals, which is not possible at present.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potentially annually recurring tax on wealth.  Although an individual&#8217;s assets and liabilities are declared in a limited number of specific circumstances - for example, after a death - Revenue state that it is not in a position to link an individual&#8217;s income to her/his financial assets.  It would therefore be difficult to gauge the likely return from a tax on wealth. </p><p>  I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that the institutional sector accounts do not give an indication of the number of households or persons classified by the categories of wealth they hold.  These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  However, I understand that, following discussions between the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform, the CSO and the Central Bank, the CSO has commenced a &#8220;Household Finance and Consumption Survey&#8221;, which will include, <i>inter alia</i>  , a survey of wealth.  The first results of this survey will be available in 2014.  The data to be collected by the CSO as part of this survey is primarily targeted as general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.</p></reply>

However the State is required to advance funds to meet the cost of the wind down. While these funds are ultimately recovered through the industry levy, it is a matter of concern to ensure in as much as is possible that the cost of the wind down is kept to a minimum.   The position is that under a Transaction Services Agreement (TSA) entered into as part of the QIL sale agreement, Liberty is obliged to provide a number of services to QIL until November 2014, including the settlement of claims in the part of the business under administration.</p><p>  The Joint Administrators have advised me that they have recruited a new CEO who has extensive experience in the insurance industry to oversee the operation of the TSA and in particular the settlement of claims. In addition, as part of a new enhanced governance structure a claims advisory committee (CAC) has been set up to guide and advise the Joint Administrators and QIL management on future claims strategy and policy.  You should note that Ciaran Breen Director of the State Claims Agency has been appointed as Chair of this Group at my request. I have been advised by the Joint Administrators  that the CAC  is currently devising a robust and distinct strategy for managing the settlement of their outstanding claims going forward with a view to settling them as quickly as possible and at the lowest possible cost.</p><p>  The Joint Administrators have also indicated to me that in light of the historic volatility in claims reserves, they have spent considerable time reviewing and improving claims controls. Based on independent reviews carried out to date they are much more confident in the underlying controls and processes governing file estimation.  The Joint Administrators advise me that taken together, these arrangements will allow them to manage claims in a more cost effective way. In the circumstances outlined above, I am satisfied that all reasonable efforts, particularly in terms of claims management are being undertaken by the Joint Administrators  in order to mitigate the cost of the winding down of Quinn Insurance. I can assure the Deputy that my officials will continue to work closely with the Joint Administrators on this matter in order to achieve this objective of minimising costs. </p></reply>

However, in general terms I would like to advise the Deputy that a recently published report of the United States Senate Permanent Sub-Committee on Investigations of their hearing on Offshore Profit Shifting and the U.S. Tax Code gave prominence to the tax arrangements of two U.S. multinational corporations, both of which have operations in Ireland. The Report finds that U.S. multinational corporations are able to significantly reduce their tax liabilities by legal international tax planning arrangements - there was no allegation of fraud or evasion - and makes recommendations on how U.S. tax law could be improved.</p><p>  Ireland is not mentioned as a tax haven in the Report - and rightly so. The international community does not regard Ireland as a tax haven. Ireland has a comprehensive taxation system covering income, capital and indirect taxes. Tax Treaties with the United States and many other countries confirm our international standing. The January 2011<i> Global</i><i>Forum Peer Review</i><i>Report</i>   on Ireland&#8217;s legal and regulatory framework for transparency and exchange of information found that Ireland has an effective system for the exchange of information in tax matters and is fully compliant with OECD standards.</p><p>  Ireland is bound by the same rules on State Aid, the Code of Conduct on Business Taxation, and rulings of the Court of Justice as all EU Member States. Ireland does not support harmful tax competition. Ireland continues to participate fully in the EU Code of Conduct Group, which addresses harmful tax competition, and in the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices.</p></reply>

As outlined, the Exchequer Returns for the period to end-September provide further evidence that the Government is restoring the public finances to a more sustainable position. The tax base is growing; the majority of Departments are managing expenditure within allocations and where there are overruns action is being taken to bring these under control. September 2012 is the third month this year in which Exchequer revenues exceeded expenditure.    As regards tax receipts, specifically while there was some minor weakening in the third quarter taxes are significantly ahead of the same period last year and &euro;385 million (1.5%) ahead of profile as a cumulative basis at end-September. Three of the &lsquo;big four&rsquo; tax heads - income tax, corporation tax and VAT - continue to perform ahead of profile with three quarters of the year already passed. This is a positive development as we strive to reduce the deficit in our public finances further.</p><p>  We cannot lose sight of the fact that, despite the significant progress made, the deficit, at &euro;11 billion for the first nine months of the year, remains too high and the Government is committed to reducing it further in the coming years.</p></reply>

The NTMA and the NPRF Commission accept those recommendations.

In relation to the specific cases of overcharging, it should be noted that:</p><p>-  The NTMA suspended State Street Bank Europe Ltd (SSBE) from its panel of transition managers when questions arose about the application of commissions by SSBE after NTMA queried  the departure of two senior executives;</p><p>-  SSBE is authorized and regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority and the NTMA has informed the Authority about the charging issues with SSBE at the request of the NPRF Commission;</p><p>-  the overcharging involved the application of unauthorised commissions to NPRF trades in a manner that was never visible to the NPRF or its global custodian and had the effect of reducing the sale proceeds obtained by the NPRF by 0.07%, and</p><p>-  it would appear that the unauthorised commissions were not identified either by SSBE&rsquo;s internal controls and procedures or by its internal audit or compliance functions.</p><p>  The measures identified by the NTMA relate to, where possible, assessing settlement arrangements for trades, engaging the NPRF&rsquo;s internal auditor where it is cost-effective to audit the books of the transition manager relating to the NPRF transactions and  seeking to promote the development of improved market standards and practices.</p><p>  The recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General include a recommendation that the NTMA should consider referring trade data for review by a third-party firm, reviewing if penalty terms should be included in contracts and reporting matters of this nature to the relevant regulatory authorities even though there may be no legal obligation to make such a report.</p></reply>

IBRC is subject to an EC Restructuring Plan which requires it to work out its balance sheet over time, including where possible via disposal of loan books.  To this end, each of the banks have established dedicated Non-core units focused on managing sales processes and  are required to report quarterly to the Central Bank which monitors their progress in achieving their deleveraging programmes. Each bank has a deleveraging committee to govern, monitor and oversee its deleveraging plans. Representatives from my department and the Central Bank attend the meetings of those committees, as non-voting observers. My department has established a Deleveraging Review Committee to oversee and monitor the operation of the institutions&rsquo; deleveraging committees and to refer transactions that give rise to actual or financial stability considerations to the Central Bank for joint consideration. Additionally, each quarter, the banks and the Authorities meet with and update the External Partners (IMF/EU/ECB) as to the progress of the plans including asset sales.</p><p>  In most instances the Banks have also employed expert professional sales advisors to assist in ensuring that the sales process undertaken maximises sales proceeds. These processes are conducted under strict confidentiality rules to ensure the economic position of the bank&rsquo;s and by extension the taxpayer as majority or part owner is fully protected. As referred to above the Deleveraging Committees and the Main Boards of the Banks must approve all material sales conducted by the banks.  To date significant progress has been made. Total deleveraging achieved across government supported banks was &euro;53bn as at 30 April 2012. Deleveraging has been achieved within planned assumed discounts. From a capital perspective, the loss incurred on the divestment of these assets is broadly offset by a reduction in the level of risk weighted assets.  The layers of Governance described above, give me sufficient comfort that adequate oversight is in place to protect the interests of the taxpayer. </p></reply>

The Government's new strategy for the development of the International Financial Services sector was issued approximately 14 months ago. Over this period, both the public and private sectors have been working together through the Clearing House Group, which is organised through Department of An Taoiseach to execute the strategy across a broad front.</p><p>  There have been notable investment wins by IDA Ireland including Northern Trust, Mastercard, Paypal, HedgeServ, ICBC Leasing and CIMB Principal Islamic.  Clearly, the Strategy is a 5 year one and we should have reasonable expectations about what will be achieved so early in its implementation and in view of the ongoing challenges facing the sector internationally.  That said, progress and business delivery to date has been has very positive.  In relation to Islamic Finance - we are now seeing a gathering momentum in this area.</p><p>  The IDA, accompanied by the Department of Finance, have recently completed a five-day promotional programme in Singapore and Kuala Lumpar with a special focus on Islamic Finance. The programme included meetings with several key prospective investors at the Global Islamic Finance Forum (GIFF).  In August 2012 the Irish Funds Industry Association welcomed the CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management Irish UCITS funds range, the first Malaysian fund promoter to establish funds in Ireland.  In relation to the Green IFSC, I would firstly highlight that a number of measures were introduced in Finance Acts 2011 and 2012 to support this initiative.</p><p>  Finance Act 2011 introduced the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) to replace the Business Expansion Scheme (BES).  The changes introduced in EII now allow for an increased lifetime limit that can be raised by a company to &euro;10 million (up from &euro;2 million). They also provide for an increase in the amount that can be raised within a twelve-month period of &euro;2.5 million (up from &euro;1.5 million).   The new scheme also allows for green energy companies to be deemed to have commenced trading when they have made an application for a grid connection agreement.  Under the previous BES, such companies were not considered to have commenced trading until they had begun to produce energy. </p><p>  In addition, under Section 110 of the tax code which deals with securitisation transactions, Finance Act 2011 broadened the scope of the &lsquo;qualifying assets&rsquo; which can be held by a Section 110 company to include a broader range of &lsquo;carbon offsets&rsquo;. Most recently, Finance Act 2012 extended tax relief for corporate investment in renewable energy projects and expanded the scope of Section 110 to explicitly include forest carbon offsets.</p><p>  In relation to other developments, I am informed that Summit Finuas and Green IFSC, in partnership with Government&rsquo;s Skillnets, has invested &euro;700,000 in sustainable finance education.  Ireland is leading the way in green finance education and over 70 professionals in the finance and enterprise sectors will have a MsC, Diploma or Postgraduate Certificate in the area of sustainable energy finance by mid 2013.  An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny with Green IFSC launched the Global Green Asset Management Network in March 2012 at the New York Stock Exchange in order to accelerate the growth in green assets managed, domiciled or serviced from Ireland, setting the target of US $200 billion by 2017.  With some $16 billion already managed, serviced or domiciled from Ireland, Green IFSC will shortly begin a global road show, lead by former Taoiseach of Ireland &amp; current IFSC President, John Bruton, to highlight why Ireland is the prime jurisdiction of choice for green asset management. The first international event takes place in New York 28th / 29th November. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-04a.86.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100400047#WRC02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 88 together.</p><p>  When the Programme of Financial Support was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to drawdown from the external sources was estimated by the EU Commission to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at the time of the agreement. The average life of the borrowings, which involve a combination of longer and shorter dated maturities, was initially set at 7.5 years.  The Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed on 21 July 2011 to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which will disburse &euro;17.7 billion, to interest rates equivalent to those of the EU Balance of Payments facility i.e. close to, without going below, the EFSF&rsquo;s cost of funding.</p><p>  The amendments to the EFSF framework have removed the interest rate margin on EFSF funds and these were incorporated into a new legal agreement on the 27th October 2011 in which the interest rate margin, which was 2.47%, is now defined as zero. The agreement incorporates a guarantee commitment fee of 0.1% per annum and a service fee to cover the cost of operations of the EFSF.  It also provides that EFSF lending done after that point will be done on a floating rate basis.  It is estimated that the overall reduction in the interest rate margin which Ireland pays to the EFSF is estimated to be in the region of 2.7 to 2.8 percentage points which includes the margin and other structural changes. The original weighted average maturity of Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans has been increased to 15 years.</p><p>  In October 2011, the EU Council of Ministers approved an EU Commission proposal to eliminate the margin of 2.925% on the EFSM facility which, when fully drawn, will amount to &euro;22.5 billion. This applied to EFSM disbursements back to the date upon which they were issued. The actual cost of funding depends on the prevailing market rates at the time of each drawdown. The original weighted average maturity of EFSM was extended from 7.5 years to 12.5 years.  Lengthening of maturities provides benefits in terms of phasing of loans and ensuring that the profile of redemptions is more orderly &ndash; avoiding as far as possible exceptionally large amounts in particular years. By contrast, money borrowed at longer maturities is generally more expensive. However, on balance, savings arising from maturity extension are significant though complex to calculate.  Given these changes, the total savings on the original EU facilities with an average life of 7.5 years is some &euro;9 billion, or approximately 5.7% of 2011 GDP. This reduces the annual repayment on these loans by an average of &euro;1.2 billion per year over 7.5 years.</p><p>  In addition, the cost of Ireland&rsquo;s IMF loans is falling as a result of an increase in our IMF quota effective from March 2011 and a further quota increase when the quota changes agreed in 2010 come into effect.  This further quota increase is expected to become effective in the near future and to result in an overall improvement of the order of 100 basis points on the interest rate on our IMF loans.  The overall benefit of these interest rate reductions is estimated to be some &euro;1.9 billion. These expected savings may change either upwards or downwards in the light of future quota revisions.</p><p>  The United Kingdom bilateral loan of GBP3.3 billion has been re-negotiated to remove the interest rate margin of GBP 2.29% although the base interest rate has been changed from a GBP interest rate swap level to the UK Debt Management Office cost of funds plus a service fee of 0.18%. The bilateral loans with Sweden and Denmark, which will amount to total disbursements of &euro;1 billion by the end of the programme, were negotiated after the interest rate margin reductions on both the EFSF and EFSM facilities and their interest rate is floating three month EURIBOR plus a margin 1.00%.  For 2012, the interest rate margin reductions in the EU and bilateral loans amount to some &euro;929 million. When the impact of the IMF changes are taken into account, the savings amount to some &euro;960 million on a General Government basis or a reduction of our interest repayment in 2012 of 0.60% of the current 2012 GDP estimate.</p><p>  As noted above, our EU programme funding is being provided at, or close to, the cost of funds for the lenders. The scope for on our programme interest payments is therefore limited.</p><p>  However, we are also seeking ways to alleviate the cost burden of assisting the banking sector.  Arising out of the 29th June 2012 statement by the Euro Area Heads of State or Government that &ldquo;... it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&rdquo; work is continuing at a technical level to put in place both the single supervisory mechanism, and the European Stability Mechanism&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation facility, at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

Interest is applied on maturity, which is after 3 years, or on encashment, which could be at any stage during the life of the Savings Bond.    Based on the estimated interest payout on Savings Bonds in 2012 of &euro;146 million, if this was subject to the higher DIRT (Deposit Interest Retention Tax) rate of 33% it would lead to an estimated tax yield in 2012 of some &euro;48 million.  The higher 33% rate of DIRT applies when interest is paid less frequently than annually, as is the case with Savings Bonds. The standard DIRT rate of 30% applies to interest paid annually or more frequently than annually and therefore is not appropriate to Savings Bonds which have no annual interest payments and all interest is paid on maturity or encashment.</p></reply>

For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow/hidden economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that its compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy, and that this approach contributes to optimising the effectiveness of their audit resources.  The results of its audit and compliance programmes are published each year in the Revenue Annual Report and in 2011, Revenue carried out over  11,000 audits that resulted in additional yield of  &#8364;440.5m to the Exchequer,  with a further  &#8364;81.3m collected from other compliance interventions and assurance checks,</p><p>  The type of initiatives aimed specifically at shadow economy activity include:-</p><p>-  Joint Investigation and information sharing activities with the Department of Social Protection aimed at uncovering either non-declaration<b></b>or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims;</p><p>-  Strengthening tax legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion, including recent provisions relating to the making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers and the more effective investigation of white-collar crime;</p><p>-  A comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, a requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, a requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place;</p><p>-  Revenue&#8217;s tobacco strategy, &#8220;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&#8221; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans;</p><p>-  Regulations introduced in 2011 requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details of payments made to the Revenue Commissioners;</p><p>-  Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses. All possible sources of information, including following up on services advertised on TV, radio, local newspapers, internet, special interest publications are used by Revenue;</p><p>-  Holding meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where mutual interest issues are discussed;</p><p>-  Focussing Revenue investigations on the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records;</p><p>-  Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out to detect unregistered businesses and non-recording of cash sales. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the scale and range of activities carried out by the Revenue Commissioners to tackle the shadow economy are extensive.  In addition, the nature of these activities is highly resource intensive however, as is the case with all public service organisations, the Revenue Commissioners must play its part in meeting Government policy on public service staffing numbers.  I am satisfied that Revenue is optimising the outputs from its existing audit and compliance resource, and as the Deputy will see from the list of activities above, audit, which is costly for business and for Revenue, can only be a part of a broader strategy.</p><p>  As part of its published Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for 2011, the Revenue Commissioners indicated that by increasing audit, investigation and compliance resources by approximately 125 qualified staff, which they estimate would cost &#8364;6.5m per annum, an estimated additional yield of &#8364;100m per annum could be achieved.  I can confirm to the Deputy that all proposals of this nature are kept under ongoing review by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government in the context of other tasks assigned to the Revenue Commissioners and competing demands for resources across the public service.</p></reply>

We will continue to target the reduction of the burden to the State of funding the bank recapitalisation and due consideration is being given to various mechanisms to achieve this goal.

To enable meaningful evaluation to take place, the reliefs need to have been in place for some period of time.

The Commission was of the opinion that tax expenditures should be the subject of ongoing evaluation and appropriate and timely cost benefit analysis.

I would generally agree with the view of the Commission but regard has to be had to the  principle of proportionality in relation to any analysis. In other words, the level of resources invested in carrying out the analysis should be commensurate with the scale of the expenditure involved and of course sufficient time is needed to undertake the analysis required.</p><p>  Finally, I would advise the Deputy that all tax reliefs are kept under review and form part of the Tax Strategy Group&#8217;s (TSG) discussions in advance of the Budget.

The Government is eager to hear reasonable proposals for budget measures from all interested parties and organisations. We will consider them fully and give them due consideration. Last year&#8217;s <i>Medium-Term Fiscal Statement</i>  set out a multi-annual fiscal consolidation strategy agreed by Government for the period to 2015. It showed the levels of consolidation it is estimated are necessary to deliver annual General Government deficit targets. It also showed the proposed split between expenditure and revenue measures and within expenditure, between current and capital measures.</p><p>  The Government is committed to meeting annual General Government deficit targets and to reducing the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015. In that context it is clear that there remains a large deficit in our public finances that must be closed further in the coming years and this will require adjustments to both expenditure and revenue. </p><p>  The objective of Government is to ensure that consolidation is implemented in a credible manner, while seeking to minimise the impact on the economy and the labour market. In line with the economic literature and the broad consensus amongst various economic agencies the Government believes the most effective and growth friendly way to implement such consolidation measures is by concentrating the majority of the adjustments on the expenditure side. Consequently, around two-thirds of the forthcoming adjustments are expected to be realised from expenditure.  However, revenue raising measures have and will continue to be an important part of the overall adjustment process.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no standard list of what is deductible for tax purposes for either companies or individuals that submit annual tax returns. The nature and extent of deductions will vary depending on the type of income or business involved.  For example, deductions in relation to rental income are limited to the items listed in section 97 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  These are expenses related to rent, rates, maintenance, repairs, property management expenses, insurance and interest.</p><p>  In general, profits in relation to a business are based on the profits as computed in accordance with normal accounting rules. This is subject to specific rules in the tax code such as those which provide that certain deductions may not be claimed for tax purposes.  For example, section 81 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 ensures that only expenses which are incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes are deductible.

The information is located in Table TR6, under the main chapter heading of Total Revenue. That table provides a percentage breakdown of the net receipt of PAYE, VAT, Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax by trade sector. The corresponding figures for 2011 will be included as soon as possible in the Statistical Report for 2011. Corresponding figures for earlier years and projections for later years are not available on a similar basis.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy of the various rates of corporation tax for the period 1990 to 2012 is shown in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><div><b>Standard Rate of Corporation Tax applicable to profits earned in the year</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>43%</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>43% &amp; 40%</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>1994</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>38% &amp; 40%</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>38% &amp; 36%</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>32%</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>24%</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>12.5%</td></tr></table></p><p>Note: Where two tax rates are shown for a year it denotes a rate change applying during the year.</p><p>I assume that when the Deputy refers to effective corporation tax she is referring to the effective corporation tax rate. In that regard I wish to advise the Deputy that companies operating in Ireland over the past eight years have been chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on their trading profits. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities. Companies&rsquo; capital gains are effectively chargeable at the capital gains tax rate and the rate was increased:</p><p>- from 20% to 22% for disposals on or after 15 October 2008;</p><p>- to 25% for disposals on or after 8 April 2009 and</p><p>- to 30% for disposals on or after 7 December 2011.</p><p>The 10% corporation tax rate for profits from manufacturing expired at the end of 2010 and the 12.5% rate now applies to such profits.</p><p>There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used. As there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure in place, I am not in a position to provide such a measure for the period referred to by the Deputy. However, I mentioned previously that an effective rate of corporation tax of 11.9% was estimated for Ireland in a <i>Paying Taxes</i> study produced by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2011 as part of an annual <i>Doing Business</i>   report. The study includes a measurement of effective tax rates across 183 countries based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country and using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances. Projected corporation tax profiles are not produced at the disaggregated level requested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Apart from the various technical meetings with Troika members, we are pursuing a diplomatic offensive which has included officials from my Department travelling recently to several capitals; my own visits to Paris, Berlin, Rome and onto the Informal Ecofin in Cyprus; and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with several colleagues at the level of Heads of Government.  All our interlocutors agreed that the imperative is to move ahead urgently to implement all of the important decisions taken on 29 June. </p><p>  In advancing our ideas, we are conscious that other member states will also put forward their proposals.  In the nature of EU business, there may be differences of interpretation but these must be within the context of the over-arching principles agreed on 29 June.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is clear in this regard and work is continuing in line with the 29 June Summit agreement to break the link between banks and sovereign and the principle that similar cases will be treated equally.   We have followed up on that basis as a matter of urgency following the latest developments. </p><p>  We want to continue to work in a constructive spirit to enhance the sustainability of our debt.  We have made strong solid progress in implementing the terms of our EU/IMF programme and have lived up to all of our commitments.   The financial markets have recognized this and this is reflected in the reduction of our bond spreads in recent months.  Let me be clear, the Heads of State or Government have made a decision on these issues and we continue to work within that framework to deliver the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer.</p></reply>

As I stated on Budget day last December, Budget 2012 balances the need to restore confidence in Ireland's fiscal position with the key objective of supporting economic growth that delivers jobs.   Budget 2012 implemented the necessary corrections to keep Ireland on track with our fiscal targets to bring down the deficit and stabilise public debt. While the short-run impact of fiscal consolidation may see a reduction in economic output, over the medium term there can be positive effects such as increased confidence and a reduction in the risk premium as the deficit is reduced and debt is put on a declining path. In addition, it must be recalled that Ireland is a small, open economy with imports comprising a large share of final demand. This means that a substantial part of fiscal consolidation leaks out of the economy in the shape of lower imports.</p><p>  Despite large consolidation efforts in recent years GDP growth of 1.4% was recorded in 2011 and almost all commentators are agreed that GDP will increase again in 2012. This performance is bringing benefits in the form of a fall in bond yields in recent months and successful re-engagement with the markets by the NTMA.</p><p>  My Department will publish its next set of economic and fiscal forecasts later this month.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy should note that the Economic Letter contains a footnote stating that the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Central Bank of Ireland or the ESCB.  The figures published in the report are based upon previously published data and I should point out that they show that Ireland has the second highest rejection rate rather than the highest as stated by the Deputy.  While this rejection rate is obviously a concern, I feel that it is important not to always focus on the worst aspect of such reports.  Business confidence is crucial in the restoration of the credit market and the continued negative narrative is unhelpful.  The report also found that there was a slight improvement in the rejection rates compared with the previous survey. </p><p>  The findings of the Mazars survey commissioned by my Department and other independent surveys, such as the SAFE survey, are used by the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to inform discussions with banks on this key area of the Irish economy and that the pillar banks, in particular adhere to their lending commitments under the recapitalisation agreements.  Robust discussions have taken place between the Department, the Credit Review Office and the banks to ensure that the banks are lending into the real economy.  In addition, the Government, through the EMC, continue to meet with the banks on a regular basis to underscore the requirement to have credit available to viable SMEs to facilitate and support the recovery of the economy. </p><p>  In terms of rejection rates from banks in general, I would remind the Deputy that the Credit Review Office (CRO) can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities (including applications for restructured credit facilities) from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000.  The Credit Review Office is overturning 55% of the refusals decisions referred to them and I would appeal to SMEs and farmers who have been refused credit by the banks to avail of the services of the CRO.</p><p>  The latest initiatives by my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in relation to the credit guarantee scheme and the microfinance loan fund should also assist the flow of credit to SMEs. </p><p>  In summary, it is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.  I remain open to any constructive suggestions which could augment the Government&#8217;s initiatives in this area.</p></reply>

Therefore, while the need for Customs attendance at fast parcel depots can be informed by the results of risk analysis, this option is not available in respect of postal consignments and it is necessary to maintain a physical presence at the main depots where postal consignments are brought into the State so as to exercise real time control prior to their release.

This involves the reassignment and training of our existing teams so that they can develop greater technical, management and leadership skills necessary to the challenge.  We will challenge and acknowledge the efforts of our key performing staff by further developing their skills and add to the value they contribute to the Department.  In parallel, we will be adding to our teams to supplement our skills base where gaps are identified.  This will also be necessary for succession planning for the work of future generations of our department.</p><p>  The addition of any new staff to date has occurred through a combination of employment via open competition and the secondment of staff from other areas of the Civil/Public Service and private sector.  This Department, following a competitive competition by the Public Appointments Service (PAS), has recruited graduates in the following disciplines to meet the needs of the Department: Human Resources (HR), Law, Accountancy, Economics, Finance/Banking and Tax Policy.</p></reply>

However, all these schemes have now come to an end and no current expenditure on the provision of any of the above facilities qualifies for the capital allowances relief.   In relation to private registered nursing homes, the termination date for incurring qualifying expenditure was 31 December 2009 but where certain conditions were met a later termination date of either 30 June 2010 or 30 June 2011 may have applied.  The nursing home must come within the meaning of section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and must be registered under section 4 of that Act.</p><p>  A separate scheme of capital allowances was available for residential units constructed on the site of, or on a site immediately adjacent to the site of, a registered nursing home.  The units must be operated or managed by a registered nursing home and an on-site caretaker must be provided.  Certain other conditions must also be met in relation to the number, design and occupation etc. of the units and in relation to the provision of back-up medical care.  The allowances were originally available for qualifying expenditure incurred up to 25 March 2007, and were finally phased out by end April 2010.</p><p>  In relation to convalescent homes, the termination date for incurring qualifying expenditure was 31 December 2009 but where certain conditions were met a later termination date of either 30 June 2010 or 30 June 2011 may have applied.  A convalescent home provides medical and nursing care for individuals recovering from treatment in a hospital.  The hospital in question must be one that provides treatment for acutely ill patients.  The convalescent home must satisfy the requirements of Section 4 and 6 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and any regulations made under section 6 of that Act as if it were a nursing home within the meaning of section 2 of that Act.</p><p>  Qualifying expenditure incurred under all of the above schemes could be written-off at a rate of 15% per annum for 6 years and 10% in year 7.  Expenditure incurred on work carried out after the various termination dates does not qualify for any allowances.  As mentioned already, all these schemes have come to an end and no current expenditure on the provision of any of the above facilities qualifies for the capital allowances relief.  Furthermore, provisions which I introduced in the Finance Act 2012 (section 17) will ensure that with effect from 2015, the Exchequer cost of the legacy of these and other property based schemes will rapidly decline.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data for the tax years 2011 and 2012 is not yet available as the income tax returns for those years are not due for filing until October 2012 and October 2013 respectively.</p><p>  Based on the information that has been received and collated to date for the tax year 2010, the latest year available, a total of &euro;43 million was included in 696 claims for capital allowances for the construction of nursing homes.  This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of &euro;17 million for these returns in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone.  These estimates are calculated before the application of the restriction on the use of certain reliefs by high earners which took effect from 1 January 2007.  This restriction on high earners was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.</p></reply>

In relation to the tax aspect of the question the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that in the circumstances outlined in the question, it would seem that the insured has incurred a capital gains tax liability under Section 535 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  However, an annual exemption of 1,270 Euro is provided for in the capital gains tax code in the case of gains made by individuals.

The Central Bank made its decision on required recapitalisation based on loan-loss projections along with further calculations concerning the prospective income, expenditure, and deleveraging plans of the banks as outlined in the 2011 Financial Measures Programme Report.  To arrive at a stressed loan-loss estimate that was fully credible to the international markets, the Central Bank engaged BlackRock Solutions, a specialist in analysing potential loan losses under stressed conditions.

These Promissory Notes are an amount due from the State to IBRC.

This should apply to both Executive and Non Executive Board members and provides a process to ensure a smooth succession of incumbent board members who were in place before September 2008.  I expect this succession to be substantially completed by early 2012, and will use my powers as shareholder to affect such changes if necessary.&quot;</p><p>Across the financial institutions covered by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, only 1 of the 43 board members currently in place was in place in September 2008.  That single director, Mr. Richie Boucher of Bank of Ireland, has passed a full fitness and probity review by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 became operational on 1 December 2011 when the Central Bank prescribed regulations into law setting out those functions (&ldquo;controlled functions&rdquo;) which would be covered by the Act, and a smaller subset of controlled functions (&ldquo;pre-approval controlled functions&rdquo; or &ldquo;PCFs&rdquo;) which will require the prior approval of the Central Bank before an appointment can be made to a Bank.  The Central Bank fulfils its functions under the Act by processing applications for approvals to all PCFs in all regulated financial service providers since 1 December 2011.  The Central Bank may refuse to approve a proposed appointment to a PCF role where it is of the opinion that the proposed appointee is not of such fitness and probity as is appropriate to perform the relevant function.  Where the Central Bank refuses to approve a proposed appointment, then a regulated financial service provider may not appoint the person to the role.</p><p>  Further, the Central Bank as part of its role in the ongoing supervision of the financial services sector, including the banking industry, may from time to time consider that there is reason to suspect the fitness and probity of any person performing a controlled function and may commence an investigation into that person.  The existence and progress of such investigations are confidential and details of such investigations may not be disclosed by the Central Bank.  As previously announced, the Central Bank is reviewing the position of executive and non-executive directors of covered institutions that received state support and who are remaining in director posts after 1 January 2012 to decide whether or not an investigation into any of those persons might be appropriate. This process provides opportunities for persons to make representations to independent decision makers appointed by the Central Bank. The Central Bank does not comment on individual cases.  All assessments of fitness and probity of persons being proposed to PCF roles, and of persons performing controlled functions are made with respect to the criteria set out in Section 25(3) of the Act and a Code issued by the Central Bank under Section 50 of the Act entitled &ldquo;Fitness and Probity Standards (Code issued under Section 50 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010)&quot;.</p></reply>

All NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA.  Under Section 42 of the NAMA Act 2009, the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA.  Other than a small number of staff reassigned from other functions within the NTMA, NAMA staff are employed by the NTMA on the basis of specified purpose contracts.  Their employment lasts for as long as their particular skills and experience are required by NAMA.  NAMA reimburses the NTMA the costs incurred by the NTMA in assigning staff and providing business and support services to NAMA.  As of 24 August 2012, some 217 staff had been assigned by NTMA to NAMA.  The highest paid executive in NAMA is the Chief Executive Officer whose salary is &euro;430,000.  However, the CEO agreed to a request from me that he waive 15% of salary in 2012, thereby reducing it to &euro;365,500.  Under the NTMA business model, there are no general pay scales.  Staff are employed on the basis of confidential individually negotiated contracts.  The average annual salary of staff assigned to NAMA is &euro;100,000.  This reflects the fact that, given the nature of its activities, the staffing complement assigned to NAMA is primarily composed of experienced professional staff with substantial private-sector experience.  Remuneration scales by band for all NTMA and NAMA staff are set out in NTMA's 2011 Annual Report.  Vacant positions within NAMA are openly advertised on the NTMA website and positions are filled through a process involving competitive interview and aptitude tests.</p></reply>

NAMA advises that, in the case of debtors that it manages directly, the value of art that it currently holds as security for its loans is of the order of &euro;7.5 million.  This relates to four debtor connections.  NAMA further advises that art belonging to a fifth debtor connection has been sold for an amount of &euro;1.9 million and that art belonging to a sixth debtor connection is currently on the market for sale.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not appropriate for commercial reasons to discuss the expected realised value of assets that are currently on the market.  The Deputy will be aware that NAMA does not own nor does it sell assets, including art, securing its loans.  The sale of these assets is undertaken and managed by their owners or, in enforcement cases, on behalf of these owners by duly appointed Insolvency Officer Holders.</p><p>  NAMA advises that the sale of art by debtors and Receivers/Administrators is conducted in accordance with the prevailing market practice for that asset and the jurisdiction to which the sale relates.  The strategies adopted, including the engagement of selling agents, are designed in all cases to maximise the realised proceeds from the sale of the art.  I would also note that while it is the clear policy of NAMA itself to maximise the realised proceeds from all sales of assets securing its loans, it is also clearly in the absolute interest of NAMA debtors to maximise the realised proceeds from the sale of their assets in repayment of their debt.  The Deputy will also note the legal, fiduciary and professional obligation on Insolvency Office Holders to maximise the realised proceeds from the sale of debtor assets.  NAMA advises that sale arrangements applied for the disposal of art are a matter for debtors and appointed Receivers/Administrators in accordance with Agency guidelines and that it would not be appropriate for it to detail the future disposal strategies, including timelines, for the sale of art by debtors and Insolvency Office Holders.</p></reply>

NAMA has to date agreed with certain debtors that the transfer of assets to connected parties be reversed.  This has involved 31 debtors with assets worth &euro;160 million. </p><p>  I am also advised by NAMA that it has been granted charges over previously unencumbered assets with an aggregate value of &euro;354 million, bringing the total value of previously unpledged assets secured through its engagement with debtors to &euro;514 million.

The sale of these assets is conducted by their owners, that is, NAMA debtors, or, in enforcement cases, on behalf of these debtors by duly appointed Receivers/Administrators.  I am advised by NAMA that its debtors and receivers have recorded over 2,500 cash receipts in respect of asset sales totalling &euro;4.6 billion as of end August 2012.  NAMA advises that cash receipts may relate to sales of individual properties or sales of multiple units as well as disposal of non-real estate assets such as shares and also deposits paid on such transactions.  Included in the these cash receipts are sales of some 3,500 individual property units, which can range from undeveloped sites and parking spaces to completed office blocks.</p><p>  However, these sales have been achieved in accordance with NAMA Board guidelines, a key principle of which is that the conduct of disposals should be on a competitive basis wherever practicable and in accordance with prevailing market practices for the asset class and jurisdiction to which the sale relates. </p><p>   The Deputy will further note that the NAMA Board guidelines require, where feasible, the sale of assets on the open market and their public advertisement and I am advised by NAMA that in the vast majority of cases the sale of assets securing its loans have been so conducted.

Relatively lower price inflation over this period means that Irish price levels have fallen relative to our major trading partners.  At the same time there has been a significant improvement in our cost competitiveness. Indeed, the European Commission earlier this year forecast that our nominal unit labour costs will improve by 22 per cent relative to the euro area over the period 2009 &ndash; 2013.  Furthermore, from a macroeconomic perspective an important measure of competitiveness across the euro area is the real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI).  This reflects relative consumer prices trends together with exchange rate developments and is produced by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Since mid-2008, the real HCI has fallen by almost 20 per cent, indicating an improvement in our international competitiveness. </p><p>  On foot of these positive developments, we have seen a recovery in our exports as well as an improvement in inward foreign direct investment, and I am encouraged by this.  Having said that, further improvements in competitiveness are clearly needed in order to make significant inroads into the unacceptably high rate of unemployment that we are currently faced with.</p></reply>

This is evident from the establishment of various institutions, such as EFSF and ESM, as well as from ECB involvement from the outset, notably as provider of liquidity.  With the June 29 Heads of State or Government statement, these responses have been placed within an overall framework with a declared intention to break the link between banks and sovereign.  Indeed, markets&#8217; reaction to this announcement as well as ensuing measures has been broadly positive and has already helped to reinforce Ireland&#8217;s efforts to regain market confidence, as also substantiated by our recent return to longer-term capital markets.  Further, economic growth is an important cornerstone of this framework, as the adoption on June 29 of the <i>Compact for Growth and Jobs</i>   reflects. Finally, the June 29 statement clearly states that &quot;[s]imilar cases will be treated equally.&quot;</p><p>  The June 29 statement and ensuing measures at Member State and European level have resulted in a general fall in sovereign funding costs across Europe, especially in programme and vulnerable countries, including large ones.  As we further implement the agreed upon measures, one would expect sovereign funding costs to continue their move to more reasonable levels.  This includes larger countries, which have benefitted from the greater flexibility and efficiency with which European support can be delivered without having drawn on these innovations.  An instance of these is the August announcement by ECB President Draghi that the ECB will do whatever it takes, within its mandate, to ensure the integrity of the euro area.  Of course, this had a significant and immediate impact.  The concrete announcement on Outright Monetary Transactions resulted in further reassurance.  Similarly, ratification in Germany and other Member States of greater flexibility and efficiency of use of EFSF and ESM instruments in the following weeks has a very positive effect, in particular on Spain and Italy.  While the positive effect on Ireland will likely not be limited to this, it is clear that Ireland has already benefitted from the wider improvement in confidence, especially regarding the stability of larger Member States.  Looking ahead, one would expect that Ireland will continue to benefit from implementation of the agreements and, of course, we would expect equal treatment.</p><p>  In recognition of the fact that countering high public and private sector debt can have limiting effects on growth, Europe has acted to stimulate growth by adopting the <i>Compact for Growth and Jobs.</i>  Necessary conditions within this framework are the tackling of public sector deficits with measures as friendly as possible to growth and differentiated across members as well as the normalisation of financial sector conditions.  Indeed, for markets to be reassured, it is necessary that measures ensuring fiscal sustainability are being taken.  To the degree that this is achieved, sovereign funding costs would fall, as also witnessed in Ireland.  These lower funding costs should eventually trickle down to the wider economy.  Facilitating this process would be a sound and stable banking system.  In regard to achieving this, Europe has already agreed wide-ranging measures to ensure sustainable fiscal positions and financial stability are ensured.</p><p>  Further growth boosting measures have been taken at the European level, also in light of the fact that private sector debt is elevated in a number of countries.  I believe the cumulative impact of all of these measures will have a positive impact in terms of supporting economic activity in the EU at this difficult juncture.  This, in turn, can be expected to benefit Ireland, given the importance of the EU as a trading partner.</p><p>  At EU level, the growth-boosting measures announced include a deepening of the Single Market and reducing the regulatory burden.  Another important measure is the mobilisation of &#8364;120 billion - about 1 per cent of EU gross national income - to boost European growth.  These funds will be made available via EU structural funds, the Project Bonds initiative, and EIB lending.  We continue to make progress in terms of maximising the amount of funding that can be made available to Ireland in these regards.</p><p>  Finally, as regards the interaction between Central Banks, I am not privy to the discussions that take place between member states&#8217; Central Banks and the ECB.  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank has sole responsibility for the performance of the functions imposed, and the exercise of powers conferred, on the Bank by or under the Rome Treaty or the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) Statute.  Section 6A(3) of the Central Bank Act 1942 provides that the Minister for Finance may not request information relating to those (ESCB) functions from the Governor or the Bank. </p><p>  That said, I do believe that there is widespread recognition generally of the need for the implementation of a coordinated approach at European level to tackle the very serious financial and fiscal problems that are evident at present and as I have alluded to earlier in my answer, action is being taken to address these problems. </p></reply>

Nevertheless, there are specific areas where inflationary pressures are emerging.  Over the past year wholesale energy prices have remained elevated on account of tensions in the Middle East.  Coupled with the depreciation of the euro, these higher prices have fed through to consumer price inflation.  Indeed, energy price inflation was running at 10 per cent in annual terms in August.  Additionally, some specific sectors have seen considerable upward price pressures, most notably insurance.  I would point out however, that excluding energy prices, inflation remain subdued.  In August, for instance, CPI excluding energy rose at an annual rate of just 1.1 per cent, in contrast to a headline CPI rate of 2.0 per cent.</p><p>  In terms of corrective steps to reduce costs for consumers, the Deputy will be aware the prices of utilities are now set by independent regulators.  I would stress that the Government is introducing a series of structural reforms, to bring down the cost of doing business, which should help reduce consumer price inflation more generally.</p></reply>

Three of the &#8216;big four&#8217; tax-heads &#8211; income tax, corporation tax and VAT &#8211; are ahead of profile at end-September.  This is a positive development.  As regards expenditure, while the majority of Departments continue to manage within their agreed limits, there are pressures, in the health and social protections areas in particular.  I know that my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department are working closely with Departments to ensure spending is managed effectively.</p><p>  As we stated in our joint press release issued on Tuesday 2 October, the Exchequer Returns for the period to end-September highlight the progress the Government is making in restoring the public finances to a more sustainable position.  The tax base is growing; the majority of Departments are managing expenditure within allocations and where there are overruns action is being taken to bring these under control. </p><p>  Overall, I am confident that on the basis of these Returns, we are on track to meet our budgetary targets for the second consecutive year this year.  </p><p>However, despite the significant progress made, the Exchequer deficit, at &#8364;11 billion for the first nine months of the year, remains too high and the Government is committed to reducing it further in the coming years. It will still be necessary to introduce measures in <i>Budget 2013</i>  which further align our revenues and our spending more closely.</p></reply>

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them. </p><p>  A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.</p><p>  It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process.</p><p>  Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance: Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings; Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal); Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff; Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools, and; Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis. </p><p>  The support of the whole school community, parents and the relevant external agencies such as NEWB and NEPS are key to the provision of guidance and support to schools. </p><p>  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service ( NEPS ) also provide a range of supports to schools. These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p><p>  My Department is also aiming to launch the Guidelines on Mental Health for Post-Primary Schools later this year. These guidelines aim to support schools in developing a whole-school approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention and are of relevance to all members of the school community. In particular, they have been developed to support principals, guidance counsellors, student support teams, and teachers. </p></reply>

Ireland has a high proportion of primary schools relative to our population and a relatively high proportion of small primary schools.

This level of close co-operation is underpinned by a Code of Practice for planning authorities on the provision of schools and the planning system.</p><p>  In addition, I recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the County and City Managers' Association on cooperation between local authorities and my Department on the identification and acquisition of sites for school buildings.</p><p>  Furthermore, in order to expedite the process of delivering projects and to maximise the output from within existing resources, my Department has been exploring alternative methods of delivering major school building projects.  Louth County Council delivered a 16 classroom primary school on a greenfield site in Drogheda earlier this year and are currently engaged in the delivery of a post primary school on the same site.  Discussions are ongoing with another local authority on the possible delivery of a school.</p></reply>

The public body has no contractual relationship with a subcontractor. Therefore any contractual issue that arises during a contract is exclusively a matter between the main contractor and its sub-contractor. </p><p>  I am conscious of the difficulties being experienced by sub-contractors.  In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies.  My colleague Minister Brian Hayes has been working with Senator Quinn to develop the Construction Contracts Bill, which is now before the D&aacute;il, into a robust piece of legislation.</p><p>  The main purpose of the Bill is to help address the issue of non-payment to construction sector subcontractors who have satisfactorily completed work on construction projects.  Minister Hayes is now examining the Bill and will decide how best to proceed.  It is important that a solution to the problem of non-payment must not place an unnecessary regulatory or cost burden on the parties to the dispute, other parties involved in the project, or the State.</p></reply>

The PSPR is an income&ndash;graduated reduction applied to each gross annual public service pension in excess of &euro;12,000. It came into effect on 1 January 2011 as part of the then Government&rsquo;s programme of measures to urgently address the serious position of the public finances. </p><p>  In January of this year I introduced a new 20% PSPR rate on pension amounts above &euro;100,000 (before then a 12% rate had applied on all pension amounts above &euro;60,000). The change was made by section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011, which amended section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010.</p><p>  The new rate is estimated to realize an additional &euro;400,000 savings in a full year.  Pensioner groups affected include former Office&ndash;holders (Presidents, Taoiseach, Ministers), former Chief Justices, Supreme Court and High Court Judges, former Civil Service Secretaries General, former Chief Executives of non-commercial state bodies, etc.</p><p>  The details of former Ministers and former Office Holders affected by this levy will take some take to collate and will  be provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The requirement to constrain such pay costs is ongoing and accordingly there are no plans to revisit this decision regarding the pay rates of public service entrant grades including teachers. Equally, it is not planned to change the position in respect of the recent Government decision to withdraw the payment of qualification allowances to new entrant teachers. </p><p>  In the context of the removal of the qualifications allowances for new entrant teachers, the Government has decided that new entrant teachers who will no longer be in receipt of qualification allowances will commence on a salary of &euro;30,702, which is equivalent to the fourth point of the existing teachers salary scale from 1 January 2011. In gross salary terms this amounts to an incremental salary gain of &euro;2,888 on the base incremental point of the scale for new entrant teachers. New entrant teachers will also have the option of being paid a pensionable allowance of &euro;1,592 for supervision and substitution, thereby bringing their starting salary to &euro;32,294.</p></reply>

I personally chair the Research Prioritisation Action Group tasked with driving implementation of the recommendations in the report and a primary focus of our agenda is to target support towards the 14 priority areas identified as offering the greatest opportunity in terms of economic and societal impact. Implementation is still in the early stages and we still have some way to go to bed down prioritisation fully. In this context and for the moment at least, consideration is not being given to adding to the list of 14 priority areas.</p><p>  However, as the Deputy may be aware, Marine Renewable Energy is one of the 14 priority areas with a focus on positioning Ireland as a research, development and innovation hub for the deployment of marine renewable energy technologies and services. Along with a number of other priority areas (e.g. Food for Health, Sustainable Food Production and Processing, Smart Grids and Smart Cities) the focus on Marine Renewable Energy will serve simultaneously to generate enterprise, improve quality of life and help meet legally binding obligations. This will help sustain and promote our reputation as a &lsquo;green economy&rsquo; ensuring the economy is competitive, inclusive and provides a high standard of living with lower environmental impacts.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the International Energy Research Centre (IERC) which is an industry led, world-leading, collaborative programme of research and innovation in integrated sustainable energy system technologies.  The IERC was established in April 2010 with a commitment to provide &euro;20m funding from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp; Innovation and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and is located at the Tyndall National Institute, based in Cork.   The IERC brings together international companies and researchers in the energy space, leveraging research capabilities and technologies to find commercial solutions to the global energy demand challenge.</p></reply>

Currently my Department is engaged in the development of a more joined-up approach to the direct delivery of supports to the micro and small business sectors which are a crucial part of our economy. This will focus primarily on the establishment of a network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) within Local Authorities. The LEOs will provide a high quality, innovative, &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; support service for small businesses, and integrate key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office.</p><p>  The Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government recently announced the Local Government enterprise and jobs strategy &ndash; Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs.

It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem, facing pension scheme is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to the increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.</p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of a scheme can be tested. When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.</p><p>  The Pensions Regulator suspended the Funding Standard four years ago, following the downturn in financial market, to give trustees/employers an opportunity to assess the impact on pension funds and to enable them time to develop responses to the challenge. Both national and EU law requires the maintenance of a Funding Standard. The reintroduction of the Funding Standard was delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to the funding challenges facing pension schemes. It was considered desirable that, when the Funding Standard was re-introduced, schemes should be given an indication as to how the defined benefit model might develop in the future. Following consultation with stakeholders in 2010 and 2011, revisions to the defined benefit model formed part of the re-introduction of the Funding Standard. </p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is being introduced from 2016, to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes, however, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which trustees and scheme members can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023.</p><p>  It should be noted that the changes to the Funding Standard are being implemented over the next 11 years, not immediately. This is the longest recovery period generally allowed in any European country. </p><p>  The guidance issued by the Regulator is being kept under review and the Regulator made an announcement last week extending the timeframe for the submission of funding proposals to address scheme deficit, until 30 June 2013.</p><p>  There are currently no plans to reverse the recently reintroduced funding standard.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two involve the enhancement of the website  and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main recognised accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders.  The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence.</p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers.  The advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis.  It is intended to review the operation of the framework in June 2013 at which point other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.  The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p></reply>

In considering the matter, I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate, and in particular, the pressures facing smaller and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>  There is a range of complex issues that need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme &ndash; the extent of coverage; the rate of payment; possible compensatory mechanisms for employers where appropriate and how a scheme would be enforced and policed &ndash; and these will be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of Budget 2013.

Internships are offered across a broad range of occupational sectors and geographic areas.  Our records indicate that 37% or 2,091 of the 5,722 interns who have finished (including both early and full completions) their JobBridge internship placement have immediately progressed into employment, 1,117 of whom with their Host Organisation and 974 with another organisation. These progression rates compare very favourably with European averages in this area.  Of the 5,722 finishers to date 3,388 or 59% are Early Completers and 2,334 or 41% are Full Completers. It is critical to highlight that 1,534 interns or 45% of those interns who leave their placements early do so to take up immediate employment either with their Host Organisation or another organisation.  It is clear that a significant number of jobseekers are obtaining employment as a direct result of the experience and skills gained on their internship.</p></reply>

The average for oral hearing excludes two protracted cases registered before 2011, and withdrawn and closed in 2012.  Processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012. </p><p>  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market. </p><p>  Analysis shows that for County Kildare, there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients.  The maximum rent limit for a couple or one parent family with two children in County Kildare is &euro;725. </p><p>  The number of rental properties available in North Kildare, including Leixlip, Maynooth and Celbridge, is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for rent supplement.  Latest figures show that there are over 900 rent supplement recipients in the Leixlip, Maynooth and Celbridge areas, indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation in these locations within the rent limits. </p><p>  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits.</p></reply>

Examples where the Department and local authorities work together in this context include:</p><p>-  Officers administering exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance may engage with the local authorities in providing assistance to applicants towards the cost of furnishing accommodation provided by local authorities.  </p><p>-  Departmental officers, in determining eligibility for rent supplement, refer applicants to the local authority for an assessment of eligibility for social housing where appropriate.  My Department also engages with local authorities in relation to housing standards in supporting the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in their aim to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards. </p><p>-  The Department has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the floods experienced in Cork in July last.  While the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for severe weather emergencies and the Office of Public Works has responsibility for capital flood relief activities, the Department&rsquo;s response to flooding situations, involves departmental officers liaising with the local authority with responsibility for the areas affected and other parties who may offer assistance to those affected.  Through this cross-disciplinary approach, appropriate supports are made available to those in need as swiftly as possible.  </p><p>-  The Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp; New Communities Unit, provides assistance to people and assists in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided in exploring accommodation options and, where necessary, liaising with the local authority to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that, where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.   </p><p>-  In order to streamline their processes and consequently provide better service to the public while reducing administration costs, staff  in external agencies, including local authorities, have been given access to the Department&rsquo;s customer information systems.</p><p>  In addition, the Department has had previous engagement with some local authorities regarding the operation of the Household Budgeting Scheme which is operated by An Post on behalf of the Department.</p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to ensure that persons do not rely on rent supplement for their long term housing needs.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative, as announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on 16th June 2011.  Both initiatives provide the local authorities with the specific responsibility for meeting the long term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement.</p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association; and the Housing Agency.  </p><p>  Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government indicate that, to date, local authorities had transferred a total of over 41,200 households from rent supplement.  The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplement whilst ensuring that rent supplement returns to its original role of a short-term income support. </p></reply>

The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses or civil partners.  Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).</p><p>  While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I have no proposals at present to extend existing arrangements for postal voting.

To this end, they have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site.  I expect local authorities to use their statutory powers as they consider appropriate.  The National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments identified the Derelict Sites Act as a potential legal instrument that could be used by local authorities as part of a range of measures to deal with the problems generated by, for example, unfinished housing developments.</p><p>  While I have no plans to amend the Derelict Sites Act at this time, I will keep the need for further legislative reforms to assist local authorities in addressing the issues of dereliction, including unfinished or unoccupied estates, under review.

Air quality monitoring carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that the ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin and the ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.</p><p>  On 9 July, following consideration of submissions received from local authorities, the health sector, the solid fuel industry, NGOs as well as members of the public under a public consultation process to review the smoky coal ban regulations, I announced that the ban would be extended to include the use of smoky coal within ban areas to complement the existing ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of such fuels. This has now been given effect through new Regulations signed by me on 31 August 2012.</p><p>  The Regulations also provide for the revision of most existing smoky coal ban areas to take account of recent urban development. The Dublin ban area has been extended to include all of Dublin city, Fingal, South Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, including many satellite towns such as Balbriggan, Saggart and Rathcoole, with effect from 31 August 2012.</p><p>  In addition, seven new towns will be subject to the ban from May 2013: these towns are Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town. The lead-in period for these new towns will allow local authorities and fuel retailers time to familiarise themselves with the new regulatory requirements in preparation for the switch-over to smokeless fuels.   </p><p>  The Regulations also require that all bituminous coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%. This consolidates the environmental and related human health benefits achieved by an earlier voluntary agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers.   </p><p>  The Regulations, along with maps of the revised smoky coal ban areas and new towns being included in the ban from May 2013, are available on my Department&#8217;s website at the following link: .</p></reply>

The preparation of the register is a matter for each local registration authority &ndash; the city and county councils.  It is their duty to ensure as far as is possible, and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.</p><p>  Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Electoral Act 1992 provide that a person is entitled to be registered where he/she is ordinarily resident on the qualifying date &ndash; 1st September in the year preceding the year in which the register comes into force. A new register comes into force on 15th   February each year. Rule 5(3)(a) of the Second Schedule to the 1992 Act provides that the registration authority may for the purposes of their duties in relation to the preparation of a register require a person to give any information in their possession which the registration authority may require.</p><p>  The publication of the draft register in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15th   of February following allows for corrections to be made.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period and they may bring errors or omissions in the draft to the attention of the registration authority. Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer. The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence.  </p><p>  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have taken up ordinary residency in a constituency after the qualifying date, come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day. Where such an application is received on the basis of a person having taken up ordinary residency in a constituency, the registration authority may require a statutory declaration from the applicant to establish that he/she has taken up that  ordinary residency.  </p><p>  An application for inclusion in the supplement must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the applicant&rsquo;s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person&rsquo;s identity before signing, dating and stamping the form. The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate.</p><p>  Electoral law is kept under review. However, I consider that the current arrangements strike a reasonable balance between facilitating voter registration and ensuring that there are adequate measures in place to counteract any possible abuse.  Electoral law also provides for significant measures in relation to voter identification and the prevention of personation.</p></reply>

The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge.    The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the household charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund.   The proceeds from the household charge   are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the contex t of the annual allocations of general purpose grants. </p><p>  General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of this year in light of the level of compliance with the household charge. </p><p>  It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 28 of September 2012 some &euro;10 5.4m or over 65% had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 general purpose grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total general purpose grant allocation for 2012. </p><p>  Local authorities can maintain the remainder of their general purpose grant allocation for 2012 through improved household charge compliance in the coming weeks. Those authorities achieving the average collection rate of 65% nationally will not have a further reduction in their final quarter general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% will incur a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% will incur a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation. The final amount of general purpose grants available for 2012 will be revisited and reviewed in mid-November to take account of the financial position at that stage, including progress on securing an increased household charge yield.   </p><p>  I am confident that the level of general purpose grants together with other Government grants and subsidies, and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.</p></reply>

The OECD defines rural areas as those with a population density of less than 150 persons per square kilometre. It was considered, in the Irish context, that a more appropriate course of action would be to remove the urban areas defined as hubs and gateways in the National Spatial Strategy from coverage under the Programme. </p><p>  The use of this definition, rather than a population density calculation, ensures that Axes 3 &amp; 4 Rural Development Programme funding is available to a more significant number of rural areas, which would otherwise not receive funding under the Programme. This approach was adopted following detailed negotiations with the European Commission and is the best possible outcome in relation to Programme coverage. The positive impact on rural areas will far outweigh any potential loss in hubs and gateways and, in overall terms, the level of investment resulting from the Rural Development Programme is a significant boost to the country as a whole. </p><p>  This specific element of the eligibility of this project was referred to the Eligibility Review Group (ERG) for consideration. The ERG process offers support to Local Development Companies (LDCs) when considering eligibility under the RDP but does not make a definitive ruling on overall project eligibility as that function rests entirely with the LDC. The ERG looks only at the query submitted to it and initially in this case the ERG considered the project ineligible. The project was subsequently submitted for review with additional clarifications and documentation; in this context, I understand that the ERG has informed the LDC, in this case South Kerry Development, that, on the basis of the additional information submitted through the ERG review process, it would consider the proposed project eligible in principle subject to the project meeting all other relevant criteria. </p></reply>

As such, local authorities are multi-functional agencies that deliver services on behalf and in support of a number of Government Departments. In particular, local authorities deliver services and/or enforce legislation in connection with a range of issues on behalf of my Department including planning and housing, fire and rescue, environmental protection, maintenance and cleaning of streets and street   lighting etc. Local government is the primary vehicle of governance and public service at local level, delivering efficient and good value services to people, performing a wide range of appropriate functions, and representing citizens and communities, as effectively and accountably as possible. </p><p>  With regard to engagement with local authorities, m y Department&rsquo;s Senior Management Team meets a number of times each year with the executive of the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA) to discuss topics of interest including the efficient and effective delivery of services . I hav e also met with the M anagers on a number of occasions and earlier this year I met with the chairs of the CCMA sub-committees to discuss a range of topics. Furthermore, a s a matter of course I attend the annual conferences and seminars of the Councillors&rsquo; representative associations &ndash; the Local Authority Members Association, the Association of County and City Councils and the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland. At these meetings, I generally meet with the officers of the associations and discuss matters of interest, including the delivery of services . Regular visits to individual local authorities also afford me the opportunity to discuss such matters with both Councillors and County/City Managers.   </p></reply>

The purpose of the pilot is to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  I am pleased to say that the pilot has been a success in demonstrating the feasibility of the new model. The experience and learning from the pilot will form the basis for proposals to extend the model on a full scale basis to Dublin Airport, and possibly to other ports if entry to the State also. These proposals are being finalised and will, of course, be the subject of any necessary Government approval and consultation with all the parties concerned. </p><p>  The pilot originally operated for 6 months and has been extended for a further period. It was never the principal intention that the pilot itself would result in savings: although, as it transpires, I understand that a result of its introduction, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been able to reassign four Garda members to other duties around the State. </p><p>  The pilot, which was initiated in the context of the terms of the &quot;Croke Park&quot; Agreement with reference to the greater flexibility provisions in it required for the discharge of public services, involved assigning a total of three Executive Officers six (currently seven) Clerical Officers as immigration control personnel operating the passport control booths. They were appointed as immigration officers in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 2004 and assigned o the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration services (INIS). </p><p>  The civilian staff undertake administrative tasks including decisions on the grant of permission to enter or refuse entry to the State to non-national in accordance with the Immigration Acts and Orders. They do not carry out any arrest or coercive functions (such as detention or removal) which remain the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. All officers selected for the pilot undergo extensive training. The staff concerned are deployed at Pier B in Terminal One between the hours of 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday. No additional core pay or allowances are paid to staff during the operation of the pilot. Requirements for immigration services outside of these hours or at other locations are currently provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who continue to preform their duties on a professional and effective manner. </p><p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to have a crucial role to play in the implementation and enforcement of immigration laws, there is the potential for greater use of civilians in the delivery of immigration services, including at ports of entry as demonstrated by the pilot. The pilot project has clearly demonstrated that and I intend to move forward on that basis. </p><p>My proposals in this area are driven with a number of goals in mind, including:</p><p>- the release of Garda members  to undertake core policing functions; </p><p>- to provide a more cost effective way of providing immigration services including at ports of entry to the State;</p><p>- to deliver on the aims of the Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014 (&ldquo;Croke Park&rdquo; Agreement) and the commitments therein by changing the way in which the Public Services are delivered to continue to meet the need for services and improve the experience of service users.</p></reply>

However, it  should be noted that the coroner is not an officer of, or in the service of, the local authority and is an independent, quasi-judicial office holder responsible for the investigation of sudden or unexplained deaths.</p><p><b>Immigration Service</b></p><p>  My Department has grant-aided a number of local authorities to assist them in promoting the integration of immigrants in their communities.  Over &#8364;3.3 million has been allocated since this funding line commenced in 2008.   My Department also works with local authorities, including through the provision of grants where appropriate, to assist them in meeting the needs of programme refugees resettled in their area.</p><p><b>Probation Service</b></p><p>  Community Service is a sentence imposed by the Court as a direct alternative to custody and is served by an offender in the community under the direction of the Probation Service. The Community Service Graffiti Removal and Site Rehabilitation Project operates in partnership with South Dublin County Council, Dun Laoghaire- Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Cork City Council, Fingal County Council and Galway City Council. Community service projects, where there are linkages with local authorities, also extend to beach cleaning, pathway clearing, work in a dog pound and house maintenance.</p><p>  The Probation Service is represented on the Multi Agency Group on Homeless Sex Offenders (MAG) which operates under the Dublin Regional Homeless Consultative Fora chaired by Dublin City Council. MAG aims to address the challenges of sex offender resettlement and works with the full support of the four Dublin local authorities.</p><p>  To aid the transition from custody into homeless/housing services, the Probation Service is a cosignatory to a recently agreed protocol involving the four Dublin local authorities, the Irish Prison Service, the HSE and the Department of Social Protection. This co-operation between the agencies is what secures the Homeless Persons Unit Inreach Service (HPU) (provided by the Department of Social Protection) into Prisons. The interface with the HPU is part of ongoing client work in both prisons and the community. In a similar vein, protocols are currently being developed for piloting between Louth County Council, Department of Social Protection, the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service in support of prisoner throughcare in County Louth.</p><p><b>Traveller Support</b></p><p>  Since 2006 Traveller Interagency Groups (TIGs) have been established under each County Development Board (CDB) to coordinate the efforts of state agencies and other stakeholders. The aim of these groups is to develop effective coordination of actions and delivery of services among agencies. The Traveller Policy Unit in my Department is monitoring progress and supporting the dissemination of good practices in implementing the interagency approach. </p></reply>

Where, for the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, it is established that the number of the entitlements allocated to a farmer in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 or Regulation (EC) No 1120/2009 is incorrect, and where the unduly allocation has no impact on the total value of the entitlements the farmer received, the Member State shall recalculate the payment entitlements and where appropriate correct the type of the entitlements allocated to the farmer.</i></b></p><p><b><i>However, the first subparagraph shall not apply if the errors could reasonably have been detected by the farmers.</i></b></p><p>  It is clear from the above that the re-calculation of entitlements can be undertaken if the area reduction would have had no impact on the total value of entitlements allocated i.e. if the reduced area was sufficient to carry the level of Premia payments made to an applicant during one or more of the years during the 2000 to 2002 SPS reference period. However, in the case of the person named, as the reduced area was not sufficient to enable the person named to have benefited from the full Premia payments made, the person named does not qualify for a re-calculation under the provisions of the EU Regulation.  </p><p>  It should be appreciated that the re-calculation of entitlements only applied to claimants, who declared commonage land, which formed part of the 2009/2010 LPIS Commonage Review. It did not apply to non-commonage land. In addition, it can no longer be applied to commonage land, as applicants are fully aware of the need to exclude ineligible land from their area declarations.</p></reply>

In 2012 the Government provided almost &euro;112 million in funding for the forestry programme, reflecting its continued commitment to a sector which is important both in creating and maintaining employment in rural areas, while also playing a significant climate change role.  I am committed to achieving the highest possible level of funding for forestry into the future, to ensure a sustainable and viable industry, and to provide attractive incentives to farmers and other landowners to plant their land.  The level of interest in forestry remains high among farmers with approval of applications running ahead of levels achieved in the corresponding period in 2011.  I am confident that this level of interest will be sustained.</p></reply>

As part of the reform process within my Department which has been ongoing for some time and has led to significant savings, I have decided to merge my Department&rsquo;s Clonakilty activities in the Clogheen complex. This will leverage further cost savings while maintaining the highest level of services to shareholders.  Administrative staff located at Darrara will, on their transfer to Clogheen, take up duties in the Marine Divisions of the Department and their former duties will be absorbed by the existing staff in the Cork Regional Office.</p><p>  These arrangements will enable the Department to maintain service levels across the county with the result of leaner staffing levels into the future.  It is important to point out that these changes will not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers and frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will be available at Park Road. The Department vets, inspectors and technical officers will remain in place at Clonakilty to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from our Regional Offices. In Cork city, current services will continue as before.</p></reply>

The local authorities are also represented on the Cross Agency ABP Group which is chaired by my Department</p><p>  In 2010, in an effort to minimise duplication of farm inspections between the two Departments, my Department agreed to carry out some 1,600 farm nitrates inspections under the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) regulations on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  This arrangement was retained for both 2011 and 2012.</p><p>  EU regulations governing the Cross Compliance regime require relevant competent authorities, including local Authorities to cross report to my Department details of cases where non-compliances are identified as a result of an inspection undertaken by that authority to establish if a penalty should be applied under the Single Payment Scheme and other area-based schemes.  Details of any relevant non-compliance identified during the course of the annual cross compliance inspections under the Single Payment Scheme undertaken by my Department are cross reported to the Local Authorities. </p><p>  My Department is also working with Cork County Council in preparing an application to the Environmental Protection Agency under the Waste Management Act for a landfill licence in respect of the East Tip of Haulbowline Island.</p><p>  As part of Public Service (Croke Park) Action Plan my Department is examining the scope for broader co-operation with local authority vets with a view to achieving a more integrated public service and creating efficiencies and improved customer service.</p><p>  Under the Marine Works (Ireland) Act 1902, I, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, am responsible for maintaining a range of piers, lights and beacons around the coast.  The lights and beacons are important navigation and safety aides for a large number of vessels and are maintained by the Engineering Division of the Department.  These Navigational Aids mainly serve harbours and piers that are under the control of coastal Local Authorities.  Cape Clear in Co. Cork is also maintained by my Department under the 1902 Act. Maintenance and ownership of these structures which serve local coastal communities may be more appropriate to a Local Authority rather than a central Government Department.  A number of such structures have been transferred to Local Authorities in the past.</p></reply>

My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter. Following cross departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC. The ISPCC has been successful in securing EU Daphne funding to support the establishment of the line.   Officials of my Department met as recently as this week with the ISPCC and a revised application for funding, in addition to the EU Daphne funding, is expected to be submitted to my Department this week.</p><p>  Officials of my Department are liaising with the ISPCC in relation to the implementation of the 116 hotline.  It is envisaged that a phased implementation of the 116000 line will commence in 2012. In the interim, a holding response is currently heard if an individual rings the 116000 number. The number advises callers wishing to report a missing child to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and advises children seeking assistance to contact the ISPCC. </p><p>  Once operational, the line will;</p><p>  1) Provide emotional support to children who are missing, their family and others responsible for the missing child</p><p>  2) Offer guidance and advice to the callers regarding a missing child; </p><p>  3) Report risk cases (where identifying information has been received) to the Garda/HSE as per Children First Guidance;</p><p>  4) Support the Garda Investigation, where appropriate;</p><p>  5) Redirect calls outside the scope of the line.</p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number. Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated. The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.</p></reply>

There are a total of 16 such committees. </p><p>The membership of all Children Services Committees (CSCs) includes senior managers from the major statutory providers of services to children and families. The Chairperson of each CSC is either the HSE Local Health Area Manager or the Area Manager for Children and Family Services and it is their function to ensure that the Children's Services Committees secures better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of existing services and interventions at local level. The Deputy Chairperson is a senior Local Authority officer. </p><p>In June this year, my Department established a CSC Steering Group whose main function is to support the effective operation and practical implementation of the work of the CSCs at local level. The Group, chaired by an independent Chairperson includes among its membership five representatives of Local Authorities.</p><p>Comhairle na n&Oacute;g (youth councils) were established in 2002 by the 34 City and County Development Boards (CDBs) in each local authority area, as part of the National Children's Strategy. Comhairle na n&Oacute;g provides a forum for children and young people to discuss local and national issues of relevance to them. Delegates from Comhairle na n&Oacute;g are elected to represent their local area at the annual D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g are recognised as the official structures for participation by children and young people in the development of policies and services. </p><p>In response to the recommendations of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Implementation Group Report (2007), the former OMCYA established the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Development Fund aimed at improving the operation of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and providing meaningful opportunities for children and young people to be involved in local decision-making.The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Development Fund is designed to assist local authorities to support and develop Comhairle na n&Oacute;g. The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Development Fund is managed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) and administered in collaboration with Pobal. </p><p>The objectives of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Development Fund are to support the development and improvement of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g as:</p><p>- a firmly embedded structure and key consultative/participative forum for children and young people in each CDB area;</p><p>- an effective mechanism for children and young people to improve their own lives in partnership with adult stakeholders.</p><p>Application and reporting requirements of the Fund requires each CDB to submit documentation on plans, progress, achievements and challenges.Report on budget expenditure is also sought. </p><p>My Department provides for the delivery of a range of youth work schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector. Funding is made available to national youth organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme and to projects/organisations under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2) Local Youth Clubs Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres and for a number of Play and Recreation programmes. </p><p>In general funding for these schemes is channelled through the Vocational Educational Authorities (VECs) but in some instances funding is paid through the Local County Councils/Local Authorities on behalf of this Department.</p><p>My Department also provides a series of small grants to local authorities each year to assist with the cost of staging National Play Day and National Recreation Week events in July and October of each year respectively. In 2011 my Department provided approximately &euro;60,000 to local authorities towards the cost of these events. Local authorities in many cases provided matched or additional funding for the remainder of the costs incurred.</p></reply>

The matter is further complicated by the fact that 3 distinct delivery/financing methodologies were also considered, namely direct investment, lease, and PPPs.</p><p>  In the list of 200, 21 separate options for PPP are interspersed throughout.  It is therefore clear that the potential net for PPP possibilities is drawn from 23 to no. 181.  It was important to note that Swords was ranked at 130 and Balbriggan at 47.</p><p>  When the index for urban and rural deprivation was multiplied by 3 to produce a further list in July, this list produced a new ranking of 338 locations in need of PCCs.This is further complicated by the increase in the number of PPP options which then totalled 44.</p><p>  The decision-making at that point was further complicated by converting planned direct options into PPPs.  Swords ends up positioned at 135 and Balbriggan at 43.  The effect of that change left Swords and Balbriggan excluded from the PPP list.</p><p>By any objective, structured criteria, Balbriggan and Swords should receive primary care centres.  Had they been completed in accordance with the original 2008 list of the HSE they would have been developed as a matter of priority and would now be serving the population of swords and Balbiggan.</p></reply>

These dealt with a range of matters, including measures to ensure that the relevant parts of the Health Sectoral Agreement within the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 can be given effect.  </p><p>  The outcome of this engagement is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are the following.  Consultants will be available for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present.  There can be rostering of consultants where required on a 16/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24/7 basis in services where this is required.  Clinical Directors will have a much strengthened management role in respect of consultants.  Consultants will cooperate with a range of measures to support improved Community and Mental Health services.  Consultant will comply with the contractual requirements regarding private practice.  Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers.  There will be more cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.  </p><p>  The agreement also puts on a formal basis consultants' co-operation with a range of productivity flexibilities, which will allow for considerable efficiencies in the use of hospital beds, with the potential to deliver a saving of 220,000 bed days annually.  Given that these flexibilities are centred on enhancing productivity on an ongoing basis, they are not expected to deliver immediate monetary savings.  A range of other measures are in train to address the current deficit. </p><p>  Separately, a 30% reduction in salary for future consultant appointees is being applied.  Management proposals to reduce the &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; arrangements that currently apply and to eliminate the fee to consultant psychiatrists for giving a second opinion under the Mental Health Act 2001 will be referred to the Labour Court, in line with the procedures provided for in the Public Service Agreement.  The issue of &ldquo;historic rest days&rdquo; will be referred to the Labour Court in line with normal procedures.</p><p>  I believe that the proposals which have been agreed between the parties, when implemented, will allow for very significant reforms in how health services are delivered and ultimately will lead to improved outcomes for users of the services. I expect the changes to be implemented in a timely manner having regard to the relevant provisions in the Public Sector Agreement.  </p></reply>

The health service must make an appropriate contribution to this reduction. The employment target for the health service is approximately 102,000 for the end of this year. While the HSE has some flexibility in relation to the filling of exceptional posts, the HSE introduced a pause on recruitment in July of this year due to the serious budgetary situation being faced.</p><p>  Therefore, decisions on the filling of vacancies of care assistant, or other posts in the health service, must have regard to the need to reduce employment levels and the requirement to meet budgetary targets. However, the Public Service Agreement allows the HSE to redeploy staff based on service need.</p></reply>

It is supported by a National Coordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in addition to other key stakeholders. </p><p>  The Programme aims to address the following issues in relation to children&rsquo;s disability services: inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services; environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion; increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability; and the need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.</p><p>  Implementation of the Programme encompasses two elements: ongoing work in co-ordinating and re-organising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams; and supporting the re-organisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.</p><p>  The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  </p><p>  The HSE is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; perspective, the services provided by each sector are integrated. A detailed action plan is being implemented with the following objectives: one clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need; resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families; and health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools. Within this context, the HSE envisages that children attending special needs primary schools will have access to health supports and therapy services based on their needs.</p><p>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for children according to need. Implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of which school they attend.</p></reply>

Mainstream Home Help and enhanced Home Care Package services  are core to not only supporting vulnerable older people's preferred wishes, but also to reducing pressures elsewhere in the wider care system. The demand for these services, and for additional supports such as Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care, will continue as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.</p><p>  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of home support services is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times.    However, this has been a challenging year for the health services generally, including trying to maintain services to older people in line with evolving resource pressures.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE home support provision over the remainder of the year, investment in such services will still be significant, with expenditure of around &euro;335 million expected to be incurred for Home Help and Home Care Packages this year.  All measures are being taken by each Local Health Office to ensure that as many people as possible continue to receive a prioritised service, in line with assessed individual needs. The objective of reducing pressures on the Acute Hospitals and the Long Term Residential Care systems is also being addressed by the HSE in the context of various on-going operational improvements to enhance the quality and focus of its home support services.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body. Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act. From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.</p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position. </p><p>  The former Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31/12/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the DAO and is independent in the performance of this function. This is a temporary measure only and a longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible.  </p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act. As part of its service the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line which is manned during normal working hours.  </p><p>  The availability for public inspection of the Determination and Reasons for Decision Reports that are produced at any particular time by the DAO is a matter for the DAO and is outside of my remit. I am advised by the DAO that all completed Determinations are available on the ODAO website. </p><p>  I can confirm that an amount of &euro;12,500 plus VAT in legal costs has been incurred by the ODAO since 1 January 2012. </p></reply>

To this end, the NAS is examining, in consultation with staff representatives, the introduction of tactical deployment from ambulance stations and suitable emergency dispatch points in west Roscommon. Work is progressing, under the terms of the Croke Park Agreement, on the introduction of the type of new work practices that would allow this service development to proceed.</p><p>  Talks were held locally in May on the use of the fire station in Ballaghaderreen as an emergency dispatch point by the NAS.

In light of this development, the NAS is considering other locations. However, challenges in relation to costs and access to appropriate accommodation mean that it is not possible a this stage to indicate when an emergency dispatch point will commence operation in West Roscommon.</p></reply>

Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.  In addition, it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole, but  that the Government is not in a position to make funding commitments for the period post-2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  The NSMC plenary approved a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the &pound;50m committed by the Irish Government.</p></reply>

It would not be practical to treat those creditors differently to those individuals who have contacted the Deputy. Ultimately the Irish tax-payer cannot be liable for failed private companies. Almost all companies in the State are regulated or licensed by the State or a State agency or body. This does not confer liability on the State.</p></reply>
