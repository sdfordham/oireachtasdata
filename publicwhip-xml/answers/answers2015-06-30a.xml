This is the best way of protecting and improving services.  A key priority for funding at primary level is catering for our rising demographics so that every child has a school place.</p>  <p>  I do recognise the need for further investment at primary level in particular to improve capitation funding to help schools with their day to day costs.  In the last Budget, I was able to secure the first increase in education spending in recent years.  I am determined to continue pressing the case for increased investment in education in the forthcoming budget.</p></reply>

Following appointment, the Design Team was authorised to advance directly to Stage 2a Developed Design.  The school's Design Team are currently working on updating site surveys and investigations in accordance with planning conditions in preparation for the Project Stage 2a Stakeholder Meeting with my Department. Arrangements for this meeting, which will include the school, will be made following receipt of confirmation from the school and Design Team that the Stage 2a material is ready.  Following this meeting and subject to no issues arising, the project will be progressed to the final stages of architectural planning and will then be well placed for consideration for inclusion in future construction programmes.</p></reply>

That Bill imposed a stricter test for discrimination on educational or medical institutions that are in receipt of public funding.  The Government accepted the Bill in principle.  The Bill is currently at Committee stage in the Seanad.</p>  <p>  Prior to framing amendments to the Bill, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission designate was asked to undertake a public consultation and examine the issues involved in relation to amending Section 37 of the Employment Equality Acts 1998 - 2011.  Its report was referred to the Attorney General's Office for further consideration.</p>  <p>  Work is now progressing on draft amendments to this Bill which were approved by Cabinet earlier today, and will be debated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann tomorrow.</p></reply>

My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to the HEA designated higher education institutions including the IoTs.  The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>  The recruitment of staff is a matter for individual IoTs and should be in line with public sector appointment criteria and the provisions of the Employment Control Framework for the sector.</p>  <p>  My Department does not hold details on the amount of funding allocated internally by IoTs for chaplaincy services; however, I have requested my officials to seek to have this information collated and forwarded directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

From 2015/2016 onwards the Primary Online Database will provide the Department with the capacity to compile this vital information on children that do not make the transition from primary to post-primary education.</p></reply>

This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  The Equal Status Act provides that a primary or post-primary school does not discriminate where the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  The recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill does not propose changes to the Equal Status Act.</p></reply>

The Plan contains details of the 275 major school projects that are planned to commence construction over the duration of the period of the Plan.  In addition, arising from the Government's stimulus funding package, a further 44 school projects are also being progressed to construction.</p><p>My Department is committed to publishing an annual construction programme.  The current status in relation to the projects contained in the annual programmes for the four years, 2012, 2013, 2014 and the current year 2015, is published on my Department's web-site which is updated regularly.  To date, 88 projects contained in the Five Year Plan have been completed. </p><p>Under my Department's Prefab Replacement Initiatives 2012 and 2013, approval was given to 217 schools (209 primary and 8 post-primary) nationwide, including Co. Kildare, to replace 614 prefab units with permanent accommodation.  In excess of &euro;57m has been allocated to these initiatives, of which &euro;46.5m has been paid to date.  Of the 217 projects approved, 168 projects have been completed and a further 14 projects are on site.</p><p>In addition to the prefab replacement initiatives and as part of my Department's large scale school building programme, prefab accommodation continues to be replaced with permanent structures on an on-going basis.</p><p>The Department continues to review the most up to date demographic information to ensure that any emerging school accommodation shortfalls are identified and met in a timely manner.  In this regard, the Department is currently carrying out a nationwide demographic exercise to determine where additional new schools and extensions will be required from 2017 onwards to meet additional demographic demand.  On foot of this review, arrangements will be made to provide additional accommodation where this is required.</p></reply>

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p>  <p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.  This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the current position is not available centrally within my Department.

Although it was not formally on our agenda, the European Council addressed the situation in Greece in some detail.  During that meeting, I joined with other Heads of State and Government in urging Prime Minister Tsipras to make every effort to conclude an agreement and to bring an end to the instability which is first and foremost hurting the Greek people.  I reiterated these points in informal contacts with Prime Minister Tsipras in the margins of the European Council.</p>  <p>  At the time of the European Council meeting, it was widely expected that enough common ground would be found between the proposals from the institutions and from the Greek authorities to ultimately bridge the gap and reach an agreement acceptable to all.  The Eurogroup meeting scheduled for Saturday 27 June stood ready to take forward negotiations among Finance Ministers.  However, that morning, we learned, to our disappointment, that the Greek Government had unilaterally decided to withdraw from negotiations.  The Greek people will now be asked to accept or reject the latest compromise proposals prepared by the institutions, in a referendum to take place on Sunday, 5 July.</p>  <p>  In addition to our contacts last week, I received a letter from Prime Minister Tsipras on 28 June requesting that the Irish Government support a request for an extension of the Greek EFSF financial assistance arrangement for a period of one month beyond the current date of termination, which is today, 30 June.  I understand that similar letters were received by my counterparts in all euro area Member States.</p>  <p>  I have since responded to Prime Minister Tsipras pointing out that, while it had been hoped that agreement could have been achieved at the Eurogroup meeting on 27 June, the decision by the Greek government to break off the negotiations made this impossible.</p>  <p>  I also underlined that Ireland, having ourselves experienced a very difficult economic period and worked our way through a programme of assistance, has great sympathy for Greece and its people.  Furthermore, I reaffirmed that we will continue to support the objective of a sustainable and mutually beneficial agreement, acceptable to all concerned, which will return Greece to growth within the euro area.</p></reply>

Another advantage of having the participants employed by their Sponsoring organisation is that they are protected by all applicable employment legislation (e.g. legal entitlement to annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, etc.).  The PRSI contributions paid as part of employment under CE goes towards future contribution-based social welfare claims (e.g. jobseekers benefit, illness benefit) and State Pension entitlements. </p>  <p>  The Department has examined the implications (legal, administrative and operational) of changing CE participants&rsquo; status to that of welfare recipients after CE was moved under the direct control of the Department in 2012.  If CE participants were paid directly by the Department as welfare recipients, they would no longer be covered by any employment legislation (as they would not legally be &ldquo;employees&rdquo;).  They would no longer have access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations mechanisms where disputes arise (Rights Commissioners, Labour Court, Employment Appeals Tribunal) and trade unions could no longer represent CE participants&rsquo; interests as employees.</p>  <p>  In terms of cost savings to the Department of the CE scheme, changing the participants&rsquo; status would have little effect, as the participant gross pay rates would remain the same regardless, as each scheme manages the payroll for participants.  In terms of the participants, only those who currently pay Class A9 PRSI (4% on all income) that have weekly earnings in excess of &euro;352 per week would see a slight increase in their net pay (as no PRSI would be deducted).  The downside of that is that they would not have the benefit of any paid contributions for their future social welfare entitlements and State Pension. </p>  <p>  However, it is an issue I am aware of and I have asked my Department to examine possible solutions to ensure it does not act as a barrier to activation.</p></reply>

For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast, and confined to social welfare dependency.  The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment.  The purpose of the reform of the one parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.</p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports, such as back to education allowance, back to work enterprise allowance and community employment.  In addition, I was pleased to introduce the back to work family dividend in the last Budget.  This provides a significant incentive for families with children to move into employment, as recently reported by the ESRI.</p>  <p>  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future.</p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment.</p>  <p>  However, I look forward to examining the various supports available to all families, including single parent families, in the next Budget.</p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone. It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.</p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network.</p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.</p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend toward electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms and I am aware of concerns that have been raised in regard to some of the amended forms.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office.  This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers.  In order to ensure that the department&rsquo;s forms present payment options equally, I have asked the department to update them to ensure that a neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided and to also ensure that one payment option is not favoured over another.</p>  <p>  These amendments will be carried out over the next number of weeks. My officials have already commenced preparatory work on this process and I expect this work to be completed in a timely manner.  However, given that the department&rsquo;s forms are integrated into its automated systems the work must be done carefully and properly to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers.  I do not wish to cause delays to our customers through loss of our automated systems due to improperly considered changes or modifications.</p></reply>

JobsPlus provides a direct monthly financial incentive to employers in the form of a monthly grant paid over two years with two levels of grant payable-&euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 provided the employment is maintained.  The level of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.</p><p>Eligibility was broadened in 2015 to include young jobseekers (under 25s) unemployed for four months or more in the previous 6 months, jobseekers transitioning from a one parent family payment (OFP) and former OFP customers whose youngest child is 14 years of age or over who are currently in receipt of a jobseekers payment.</p><p>At the end of May 2015, the Department made payments of just over &euro;1.886 million to 3,587 employers in respect of 4,901 employees.

Over 5,600 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s recent review of rent limits points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting and seeking to rent is the reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  In this regard, the Government will deliver significantly increased supply of social and affordable housing through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.  My colleague, Alan Kelly T.D., Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, has also advised his intention to bring proposals on rent certainty to Government before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  In response to the difficulties experienced by persons renting or seeking to rent in the current market, the Department has implemented preventative measures to provide for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, the circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits.  The Department also works with Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Sustainment service in Dublin and Cork city where supply is most acute.  This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,100 rent supplement households nationwide through increased rent payments.</p>  <p>  Where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss, the preventative measures are implemented as appropriate.  The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign to encourage people at risk to avail of these measures.  I am continuing to keep this matter under review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided.</p></reply>

For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast, and confined to social welfare dependency.  The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment.  The purpose of the reform of the one parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.</p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports, such as back to education allowance, back to work enterprise allowance and community employment.  In addition, I was pleased to introduce the back to work family dividend in the last Budget.  This provides a significant incentive for families with children to move into employment, as recently reported by the ESRI.</p>  <p>  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved.</p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future.</p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment.</p>  <p>  Child care policy, including the delivery and/or expansion of child care services, is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA).</p>  <p>  The reforms to the one-parent family payment have highlighted the need for child care supports to be available for lone parents who make the transition into employment.  With this in mind I introduced the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment in 2013.  This is available to OFP customers who transition from the OFP scheme onto a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment and who have a youngest child aged under 14 years.  These customers are exempt from the JA conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking full-time employment, which would have been difficult for lone parents with young children to adhere to.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment allows this cohort of customers to balance their caring responsibilities and significantly reduces their requirement for child care, while allowing them to work part time should they so wish.  Through the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, I have provided lone parents with children aged between seven and 13 years with a very long transition period of seven years within which to engage with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service to become job ready and find sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  My Department in conjunction with the D/CYA, introduced the after-school child care scheme and the community employment childcare programme in 2013 and 2014 respectively.  Both of these schemes were funded by my Department from savings from the child benefit scheme and build on the 25,000 subsidised childcare places provided by the D/CYA each year.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, I introduced increases to the child benefit rate, the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, as well as the back to work family dividend, all of which provide additional financial assistance to parents.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also established a group at senior inter-Departmental level to carry out an economic and cost-benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility, and affordability of quality child care, including early years and after-school child care.  It is intended that the group will finalise its work in the summer of 2015.</p></reply>

These organisations contract with the Department to provide work experience and training opportunities on an annual basis for jobseekers and other qualifying adults.  The sponsoring committee members act on a voluntary basis.  Grant aid is provided by the Department to cover the following costs:</p>  <p>- Supervisory costs;</p>  <p>- Participants&rsquo; wages;</p>  <p>- Training grant; and</p>  <p>- Materials grant.</p>  <p>  Voluntary community groups wishing to avail of grants under the CE scheme have to meet the Department&rsquo;s criteria for receipt of such grants.  Incorporation as a legal entity is the primary requirement that must be met in advance of any contract/agreement being issued by the Department.  Incorporation as a separate legal entity gives the sponsoring organisation members certain legal protections and also grants competency for the legal entity/company to sign contracts on behalf of the Sponsor group.  Without having the legal entity with which to contract, any contracts or agreements signed would be unenforceable.  There is no derogation possible with this requirement to incorporate.</p>  <p>  CE is a valuable resource in the support of a range of social services to communities, including childcare.  The primary objective of CE is the provision of valuable work experience and training to unemployed and other disadvantaged groups.  CE is a broad and flexible programme that has been utilised to address many social challenges presenting at individual and/or societal level e.g. rehabilitative programmes and supporting communities in the provision of services.</p></reply>

During the first two years of self-employment, the allowance is paid at 100% for the first year of operating and at 75% for the second year.  The Short Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) provides immediate access to those who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and wish to set up a business. Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. At the end of May, 2015 there were 11,523 people availing of the BTWEA and 486 on STEA.</p><p>In the event that a business venture is unsuccessful, the customer may have an entitlement to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in the same way as any other jobseeker.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing whether they are entitled to State pension contributory, and the level of any such entitlement.  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 defines insurable employment as &ldquo;employment such that a person, over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, employed in that employment would be an employed contributor".  To qualify for a state pension a person must &ndash;</p>  <p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions, and</p>  <p>  - satisfy a yearly average test (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and/or credited is required for a maximum rate pension, reduced rates may be paid at various levels where the yearly average is between 10 and 47). </p>  <p>  Once a person reaches pension age he/she is no longer in insurable employment and therefore is not liable to pay PRSI contributions.  There are no provisions in legislation which allow a person to pay contributions beyond pension age. </p>  <p>  If legislation was to be introduced to exempt those with 40 years of contributions from paying further PRSI, it would reduce the yearly average of those people at retirement, and they might consequently qualify for a lower rate of State pension (contributory), depending on their circumstances.  It would also mean, before retirement, that they might lose entitlement to working age payments, such as Jobseekers Benefit and Illness Benefit.  It would also reduce the level of PRSI payments made into the Social Insurance Fund, thereby requiring (a) an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the fund, (b) an increase in the rate of PRSI paid during working life, and/or (c) a reduction in the rates of PRSI-funded payments, such as the State pension (contributory).</p></reply>

The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  </p>  <p>  The Government decided that the LPT should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity; and that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions and reliefs.  Limiting the reliefs available allows the rate to be kept to a minimum for those liable persons who do not qualify for relief.</p>  <p>  With regard to properties in estates where the estate has not been taken in charge by the local authority, I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that the taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Section 180(1) provides, in relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission, that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities on 26 February 2008 on Taking in Charge of Residential Developments/Management Arrangements.  This required each planning authority to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 which is based on the following principles (among others):</p>  <p>  - Certain core facilities/infrastructure to be taken in charge on request - public roads and footpaths, unallocated surface parking areas, public lighting, public water supply, foul and storm water drainage and public open spaces;</p>  <p>  - The procedures for taking in charge to begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate.  Protocols, including time frames, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking in charge.</p>  <p>  With regard to properties in managed estates, to which management fees apply, such properties would have been purchased by their owners in the knowledge that they would be taking on commitments to partake in, and to fund, the management of the estate, and that it was the intention that many such estates would not be taken in charge by local authorities, nor would it be appropriate for local authorities to do so.</p>  <p>  Management fees in these estates can include services such as refuse collection, maintenance of common areas as well as a sinking fund for certain repairs to the buildings, depending on circumstances.  These are costs which homeowners in other households have to fund themselves for their own properties. </p>  <p>  A requirement to pay management fees, or to contribute to estate management via a residents association, is not relevant in determining whether a property is subject to the LPT.  Accordingly, whilst those who are liable for management fees to property management companies, or are party to resident association arrangements, may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific exemption for the payment of management fees.  There are no plans to change the basis of liability to LPT. </p>  <p>  Revenue from the LPT accrues to local authorities and supports the provision of local services. Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm, which benefit the wider community.  The proper functioning of these services are important for the wellbeing of every community and household.  These include: fire and emergency services; road maintenance and cleaning; street lighting; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions and business support services, as well as libraries, parks, and other recreation and cultural public amenities.  The benefits of these services accrue to all members of society.</p></reply>

As these certificates are issued by competent experts, Revenue has no role in interpreting the tests referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  It is important that any changes that may be made do not go beyond the objectives of providing a temporary exemption only for homes with "significant pyritic damage".  Without prejudice to the outcome of the review to which I have referred, the resolution of the matter may necessitate a change in the relevant provisions of the Finance (LPT) Act 2012 (as amended) and/or the Finance (LPT) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations.

In that regard, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that rental income for tax purposes is the gross rental income less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent, as specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The main deductible expenses are:</p><p>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>- the interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with Private Residential Tenancies Board registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and</p><p>- the payment of local authority rates. </p><p>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.  These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years. </p><p>Section 5 of Finance Act 2009 imposed a cap of 75% on the amount of interest on loans used to purchase, improve or repair a rented residential premises that can be deducted in computing the amount of a person's taxable rental income.  This restriction was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget in respect of all residential lettings as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances.  The restriction does not apply to loans taken out to finance non-residential property and the full amount of interest can continue to be deducted in such cases. </p><p><b>Local Property Tax </b></p><p>A deduction is not allowed in respect of LPT as it is not one of the specified deductions provided for in section 97(2) of the TCA.</p><p>Local Property Tax is an annual self-assessed tax on residential properties in the State and is administered by the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended). </p><p><b>Stamp Duty </b></p><p>The rate of stamp duty applicable to Conveyances/Transfers of Non-Residential Property is 2%.  The rates of stamp duty applicable to Conveyances/Transfers of Residential Property are:  1% for the first &euro;1,000,000 and 2% on the excess over &euro;1,000,000. </p><p><b>Commercial Rates </b></p><p>I am advised by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that properties used for commercial purposes are subject to rates levied by local authorities which are based on values entered on the valuation lists by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 (as amended).

The company must pay corporation tax on rental profits and gains and when the after-tax profits are paid out to the investors (as dividends), income tax is then payable on the dividends received (i.e. on the profits which have already been subject to corporation tax).</p>  <p>  The double layer of taxation does not apply to residential property owners directly holding property.</p>  <p>  The purpose of a REIT is to remove this double layer of taxation, which has tended to result in individual investors holding individual, highly-mortgaged properties.  This has exposed investors to significant risk in times of falling equity and falling rental returns.</p>  <p>  A REIT is exempt from corporation tax on qualifying income and gains from rental property, subject to a high profit distribution requirement to shareholders (the Irish distribution requirement is 85% of property profits).  Under Irish REITs legislation, there is no distinction in tax treatment between residential and non-residential property.</p>  <p>  Irish investors are subject to tax on receipt of REIT dividends in broadly the same way as if they had invested directly in rental property. </p>  <p>  When individuals invest directly in property, they are subject to income tax on their rental profits and capital gains tax on sales proceeds. </p>  <p>  Similarly, REIT dividends will be taxable income for individual shareholders, so their rate of tax will depend on what other income they have in the relevant tax year.  Marginal rate Irish taxpayers will be liable to income tax at their marginal rate on REIT dividends, and taxpayers under the marginal rate threshold will pay the standard rate of tax on their dividends. </p>  <p>  Foreign individual investors will receive REIT dividends net of Dividend Withholding Tax at 20%, which may be mitigated under the terms of a double tax agreement.  Foreign investors may also be subject to further tax in their country of residence.</p></reply>

The restriction was introduced in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget in respect of all residential lettings as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the year 2013, the latest year for which relevant information is available, and making certain assumptions about the data available to Revenue, it is estimated that the cost from increasing the level at which individuals can claim interest repayments against tax for residential rental properties from 75% to 100% could be in the order of &euro;80 million.  This is based on the assumption that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figures provided could be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost.</p>  <p>  Rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings and the figures for interest are not separately distinguished in Corporation Tax returns.  There is, therefore, no basis for an estimate of the cost of changing the tax relief for corporate landlords. </p>  <p>  As with all proposals to change reliefs relating to property, there are a number of considerations which must be taken into account to correctly target the measure and ensure this success.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.339.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000071#WRF04300"><p>I understand that this question relates to transactions to which capital gains tax (CGT) relief for farm restructuring under section 604B Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 may be sought. The details relating to this relief are set out hereunder.  As regards a special tax relief for land previously owned by the Land Commission, I can say that no specific relief in relation to such land has ever been provided for under CGT legislation.  I would require much more detailed information on the nature of the tax relief being referred to before I could comment more generally.  My understanding is that the Land Commission was dissolved in 1999 and that any questions regarding its activities and responsibilities would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr Simon Coveney TD. </p>  <p>  As regards the CGT farm restructuring relief, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 604B Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended by section 49 Finance Act 2014, provides for relief from CGT on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring. </p>  <p>  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2016 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes.  The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase. </p>  <p>  Full relief from CGT will be given where the consideration for the purchase of agricultural land is equal to or greater than the consideration for the sale of such land.  Where the consideration for the purchase of agricultural land is less than the consideration for the land that is sold, relief will be reduced on a proportionate basis. In the case of an exchange of agricultural land, full relief from CGT will be given where the value of the land that is exchanged is equal to or greater than the value of the other land that is exchanged.  Where the value of the land that is exchanged is less than the value of the other land that is exchanged, a corresponding reduction will apply to the relief that will be given.   </p>  <p>  Provision is made for the clawback of the relief where qualifying land in respect of which relief has been given is disposed of within 5 years of the date of the purchase or exchange of that land.  A clawback does not apply where the disposal arises under a compulsory purchase order.</p>  <p>  A prerequisite to any disposal and acquisition of farm land qualifying for this relief is that an application for a farm restructuring certificate is made to Teagasc, that Teagasc grants such a certificate and that such certificate has not been withdrawn.  Guidelines relating to the application for, and the issue of, a farm restructuring certificate are available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's website.</p></reply>

The rate of tax deduction to apply depends on the sub-contractor's tax compliance record.  A person who previously held a C2 Certificate under the old regime, and whose tax compliance record has remained good, is very likely to be allocated a 0% tax deduction rate in the current regime. </p><p>As to the amount of tax paid under the &quot;C2 arrangement&quot;, as I have explained, holding a valid C2 Certificate meant that a subcontractor received payments from a principal contractor without having tax deducted at source from those payments and therefore the matter of tax paid does not arise in such cases. </p><p>As to the Deputy's question about the number of registered subcontractors who held a C2 Certificate, as explained, the C2 Certificate was abolished at the end of 2011.  A person who previously held a C2 Certificate under the old regime, and whose tax compliance record has remained good, is very likely to be allocated a 0% tax deduction rate in the current regime.  The number of subcontractors at the 0% allocated rate of tax deduction under the new system, is as follows:<table><tr><th>Tax Year</th><th>Number of sub-contractors with  0% rate of tax deduction</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Construction</td><td>Meat Processing</td><td>Forestry</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>30,015</td><td>355</td><td>533</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>30,606</td><td>349</td><td>536</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>31,981</td><td>362</td><td>568</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These payments, in aggregate, totalled &euro;79,200.  No performance-related payments were made to any employee earning a salary of over &euro;150,000.  I am also advised that no such performance-related payments were made to any staff assigned to NAMA.  I am further advised by the NTMA that performance related pay is determined at the end of the year, therefore figures for 2015 are not available at this stage.  As outlined in my Department's review of NAMA under Section 227 of the NAMA Act, NAMA's ability to achieve its ultimate objectives is premised on a number of assumptions, including that it is able retain sufficient operational capacity and specialist staff.  As a result a key finding of that review was that any proposal to help safeguard NAMA's operational capacity and staffing expertise should receive careful consideration in light of potentially significant value implications associated with losing key employees.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I am working with the NAMA Board in this respect and, as the Deputy is aware, arising from those discussions, appropriate staff retention and redundancy measures are being put in place to protect the financial performance of NAMA.  The overall cost of these measures, including statutory redundancy, will not exceed &euro;20m.  NAMA is hopeful that these measures will enable it to manage its staffing requirements to help ensure the delivery of its objectives.  I refer the Deputy in this respect to my response to Parliamentary Question 107, which was answered on 12th March 2015 and to page 9 of the 2014 NAMA Annual Report which is available on NAMA's website.</p></reply>

I did, however introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015.  I did this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.  I confirmed in my Budget 2015 speech that the additional 0.15% levy will expire at the end of this year. </p>  <p>   The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p>  <p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of members benefits exceed the members or class of members share of the levy. </p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levy will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.363.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000072#WRG01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</p><p>It is clear that NAMA is a making a substantial contribution to the provision of social housing.  Since 2012, under an initiative agreed with the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, NAMA has identified 6,391 houses and apartments held by its debtors and receivers as being available and potentially suitable for social housing.  These properties have been identified on an ongoing basis by NAMA as being available either through the completion, with NAMA funding, of previously unfinished properties, or as formerly tenanted properties have become available.  These 6,391 properties equate to more than 45% of the total stock of completed residential properties securing NAMA's loans when it acquired the loans from the participating institutions. </p><p>To explain the process, once NAMA identifies a property as being available, it is a matter for local authorities, working through the Housing Agency, to determine demand for that property by reference to criteria such as location and wider planning and housing policy considerations.  NAMA has no role in this process - it is a matter for the statutory housing authorities.  Once local authorities have confirmed demand for properties, the approved housing bodies (AHBs) are, through the Housing Agency, asked to confirm and progress their interest in leasing or purchasing the properties.  Local authorities also have the option of directly acquiring the properties.  Again this is a matter entirely for the statutory housing authorities and NAMA is not involved in the process. </p><p>Of the 6,391 properties identified by NAMA as available, local authorities have confirmed demand for 2,356 of which 1,198 have already been delivered by NAMA across 74 individual transactions.  As requested by the Deputy, a breakdown of delivery by year under this initiative is set out as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number </th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>229</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>367</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>472</td></tr><tr><td>Q1 2015</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>Total to Q1 2015</td><td>1198</td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised that NAMA expects the other units for which demand has been confirmed will be delivered in 2015 on the basis that local authorities and approved housing bodies contract to purchase or lease the properties.  Updated figures for the period to end Quarter 2 2015 will be published on both the NAMA and Housing Agency websites in early July.  </p><p>Once demand has been confirmed for units and contracts signed there is no impediment to the early delivery of properties by NAMA's debtors and receivers or directly through NAMA's social housing SPV, National Asset Residential Property Services Limited (NARPSL).  In the case of NARPSL, once demand has been confirmed by local authorities NAMA acquires the related properties from its debtors and receivers for onward leasing under long-term leasing arrangements to AHBs.  Where obstacles have emerged, there has been no shortage of effort to work around them and along the way the parties have collectively identified way to help streamline the process.  The establishment of NARPSL is one example of the initiatives that NAMA has taken, in conjunction with the other key stakeholders in this process, to streamline the delivery of properties for social housing.  NAMA has also introduced standardised leasing terms.  NAMA also advises me that, based on working on this initiative over the past number of years, its experience is that every party involved does whatever it can to deliver these units as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that NAMA's specific role relates to making the houses available in the first place and ensuring that where demand is confirmed the properties are delivered as efficiently as possible.  NAMA does not determine which units are selected for social housing nor how these units are allocated.  </p><p>In relation to NAMA's role, the Deputy will note that, in the vast majority of cases, the properties for which demand has been confirmed require substantial completion or remediation work and the resolution of compliance issues in relation to planning conditions, and regulatory standards, title issues and Multi-Unit Development Act compliance including transfer of common areas and insolvent management companies.  It is NAMA's policy and practice that all properties are completed to a high standard, in compliance with all relevant planning and building regulations.  In this context, NAMA has to date provided over &euro;25m for completion works to facilitate the delivery of properties for social housing. </p><p>Further detail on this initiative can be found at <i></i></p><p>The following table provides a detailed breakdown by local authority functional area of the properties identified by NAMA and the take up by local authorities.</p><p><b>Table 1: Social Housing Delivery by Local Authority</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Identified by NAMA</th><th>Demand Confirmed</th><th>Delivered</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co.

The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan.  This Bill will require entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct.  Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad.  New owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated.  Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January 2015 and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February 2015.  The Bill is continuing its progress through the legislative process.  The Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il on 17 June 2015 and Second Stage taken in the Seanad on 24 June 2015.

Previously the write off of the loan was treated as a capital adjustment and was not taxable.</p><p>The purpose of these changes was to deny tax deductions in circumstances where there is no real economic loss suffered by the taxpayer.</p><p><b>Section 88A and section 472A:</b>Section 7 Finance Act 2013 discontinued the double deduction in respect of certain emoluments and relief for the long term unemployed, in respect of employments commencing on or after 1 July 2013.  They were replaced by the new JobsPlus scheme.</p><p><b>Section 126: </b>Section 8 of the Finance Act, 2013 removed the tax exemption in respect of maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and health and safety benefit with effect from 1st July 2013.</p><p><b>Section 201:</b>Foreign Service Relief on ex gratia termination lump-sum payments, provided for in section 201 of Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, was abolished with effect from the passing of Finance Act 2013 (27 March 2013).</p><p><b>Section 201 and Schedule 3:</b>Top Slicing Relief (TSR) on ex-gratia lump sums payments was ceased from 1 January 2013 where the payment was &euro;200,000 or over.  The yield was estimated at &euro;10m in a full year.  TSR was abolished completely for ex gratia payments made on or after 1 January 2014 with an expected yield of &euro;22m in a full year.</p><p><b>Section 201: </b>Finance Act 2013 applies a lifetime limit of &euro;200,000 on the amount that may be paid tax-free to ex-gratia payments made on account of the death or disability of an employee.  Any amount exceeding &euro;200,000 is taxable in full.</p><p><b>Section 253:</b>Relief to individuals on loans applied in acquiring an interest in a partnership was abolished for new loans with effect from 15 October 2013.  Relief for existing loans was restricted commencing in 2014, with relief being reduced on a sliding scale each year until 2016 with no relief available in 2017.  Savings of &euro;1m in 2014, and &euro;4m for each year thereafter, were estimated.</p><p><b>Section 261A and Section 267C:</b>Section 23 of Finance (No.2) Act 2013 removed the exemption from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) which applied to a portion of interest earnings on medium and long term accounts held in financial institutions or credit unions.  Medium term accounts are defined as accounts which are held by a deposit taker for a minimum of three years and long term accounts are those held for a minimum of five years.  The first &euro;480 of interest earned in any year on medium term accounts, and the first &euro;635 of interest earned in any year on long term accounts, was exempt from DIRT.  New accounts opened on or after the 16th October 2013 cannot qualify for the relief but medium and long term accounts opened prior to that date continue to qualify for a duration of three and five years respectively from the date the accounts were opened.  The amount of DIRT forgone in respect of medium and long term accounts is not returned to Revenue.</p><p><b>Section 268 and 316:</b>Section 8 of the Finance Act, 2009 provided that capital expenditure on two property tax incentive schemes had final termination dates in 2013.  In relation to the Mid Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme, capital expenditure incurred up to 31 May 2013 qualified for relief.  In relation to Qualifying Private Hospitals, provided certain conditions were met, capital expenditure incurred up to 31 December 2013 also qualified for relief.</p><p><b>Section 462:</b>The One Parent Family Tax Credit (OPFTC) of &euro;1,650 for a single individual with whom a qualifying child resided during a tax year was ceased at 31 December 2013.  It was replaced by the Single Person Child Carer Credit from 1 January 2014.  This was estimated to yield &euro;18m in 2014 and &euro;25m in a full year.</p><p><b>Section 470:</b>A cap was introduced on relief for premiums for qualifying health insurance policies in respect of policies entered into or renewed on or after 16 October 2013.  A maximum relief of &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child covered by a policy was introduced.  This was estimated to yield &euro;94m in 2014 and &euro;127m in 2015.</p><p><b>Section 481:</b>Income tax relief for individuals who invest in the production of qualifying films was abolished with effect from 1 January 2015.  This relief has been replaced by a Corporation Tax credit of 32% of qualifying expenditure incurred by a Film Production Company in the making of a qualifying film.  The cost to the exchequer for the income tax relief in 2013 was estimated to be &euro;76m based on investment in qualifying expenditure of &euro;185m relieved at the 41% marginal income tax rate.  If a similar level of qualifying expenditure is incurred in 2015 the move to relief by way of a 32% Corporation Tax credit will yield a saving to the exchequer of &euro;17m.</p><p><b>Section 486B: </b>Section 486B provided for a scheme of tax relief for corporate investments in certain renewable energy projects in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories.  The relief was given in the form of a deduction from a company's profits for its direct investment in new ordinary shares in the qualifying renewable energy company.  The relief expired with effect from the 31st December 2014.  As a relatively small number of claims where made in 2013 and 2014 in respect of this scheme, I am unable to provide a figure for the tax savings to the exchequer following the abolition of this scheme as release of this information may lead to the identification of the taxpayers who have availed of the relief.</p><p><b>Section 825B:</b>Repayment of tax where earnings are not remitted was phased out with effect from tax year 2012 with end year of 2015.  The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP - section 825C) was introduced from tax year 2012.</p><p><b>Section 848A:</b>The scheme of tax relief for donations made to approved bodies (i.e. charities etc.) was amended in a number of respects with effect from 1 January 2013.  One of the changes was that relief for donations made by self-assessed taxpayers, previously obtained by way of a deduction from taxable income, was aligned with that for PAYE-only taxpayers such that the relief is now given on a &quot;grossed-up&quot; basis at the rate of 31% to the approved body (and not to the donor).  This and the other changes made were on a cost neutral basis. </p><p><b>Section 604A</b></p><p>The CGT property incentive scheme introduced by Budget and Finance Act 2012 and which commenced on 7 December 2011 ceased with effect from 31 December 2014.  Since individuals must hold on to a property acquired for 7 years or more before disposing of it in order to qualify for the relief, no tax cost has therefore yet arisen in relation to the relief.  <b></b></p><p><b>Indirect Taxation</b></p><p>In Section 55 of Finance Act (No. 2), 2013, I did not extend the Vehicle Registration Tax relief of up to &euro;1,500 which had been available for flexible fuel vehicles, on the basis that this type of vehicle was largely redundant, which also meant that no savings arose.  </p><p>In Statutory Instrument 139 of 2014, I abolished the disabled drivers' fuel relief and replaced it with a fuel grant scheme with effect from 1 January 2015.  As the relief was replaced by a grant scheme of the same value, no savings resulted.  <b></b></p><p><b>Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme </b></p><p>As a consequence of a judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the excise repayment of fuel element of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme was converted into a fuel grant of the same value from 1 January 2015.  As the grant is the same value as the excise relief, no savings have arisen to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

In circumstances where there are grounds to believe that tax due has not been declared and paid by the taxpayer, Revenue investigates the suspect person's tax liabilities and  collects any unpaid tax, including income tax, SFCT and VAT, together with any interest or penalties due.  In addition, as part of its tax compliance programme, Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG), established to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Suppliers who suspect, or have evidence, that illegal and/or untaxed solid fuel is being sold in their area should report this to their Local Authority and to Revenue, respectively, either directly or through their representative associations.  Reports of this nature are treated confidentially and investigated by Revenue.  </p>  <p>  Revenue inform me also that the administration of the tax is heavily dependant on the regulatory regime for coal established by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2011.  This regulatory regime establishes higher standards for coal supplied in the State compared with Northern Ireland, and provides for enforcement of those standards.  Suppliers who supply solid fuels unlawfully are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State agencies charged with preventing such supply and with enforcing the coal regulations.  Any review of this regulatory regime is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

PRSI class S contributors can establish entitlement to maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, guardian's payment and long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks. </p><p>I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p><p>The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.  Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. </p><p>In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks.  This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. </p><p>In relation to switching, I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is planning to provide more information to consumers to encourage switching.  I expect that if financial institutions are convinced that there is a threat that they will lose these customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge existing customers.  The CCPC website <i></i>is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various<i></i>financial institutions.</p><p>The Government made a commitment in the Statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016 to applying downward pressure on mortgage rates by increasing and supporting competition in the market and it will continue to work to fulfil that commitment. </p><p>As I have previously made clear, officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks and a follow up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget.</p></reply>

The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, will also end after this year.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.</p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected as set out in the question.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees etc) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the income tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

These apply for all landlords, regardless of whether the landlord is renting elsewhere.</p><p>Mortgage Interest Tax Relief</p><p>Section 244 of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of interest paid on qualifying loans taken out to purchase, repair or improve a property that is used as a sole or main residence.</p><p>The relief, which is due to end in 2017, is available in respect of all qualifying home loans taken out between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2012. </p><p>Persons that purchased their home within this specified date range are entitled to a 30% rate of relief on interest paid up to an interest ceiling of &euro;20,000 if married/widowed and &euro;10,000 if single, for the first seven years.  Thereafter, the ceiling reduces for the remaining years to a maximum of &euro;6,000 if married/widowed and &euro;3,000 if single. </p><p>Revenue has informed me that the person would initially have been entitled to the relief at the 30% rate with effect from 1 January 2008 through to 31 December 2014. However the entitlement would have been discontinued from the time the person started to rent the property out because it no longer served as his/her sole or main residence. </p><p>If the person subsequently returned to live in the property as his/her sole or main residence, then he/she should reapply for mortgage interest relief.</p><p>Tax on rental income</p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxable amount of rental income from the letting of property is the gross rent less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent, as specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.  The main deductible expenses are:</p><p>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property; and</p><p>- interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property. This relief is restricted to 75% of the interest payable on borrowings related to residential property and is subject to full compliance with registration requirements of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.  These allowances are granted on the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings at the rate of 12.5% per annum over a period of 8 years.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has published a guide to the income tax treatment of rental income.  It sets out the amount of rental income to be taken account of for income tax purposes and provides a comprehensive list of expenditure items that are allowable for deduction in computing the rental income for income tax purposes.  This guide is available at:  .</p></reply>

The purpose of the revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers based on up-to-date rental values.  Following revaluation, there will generally be a much closer and uniform relationship between the rental value of a property and the commercial rates liability which applies to that property.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy. </p>  <p>  As part of the national revaluation programme, the Valuation Office published a new valuation list for the Limerick City and County Council rating authority area on 31 December 2014.</p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Valuation Act, 2001, as amended, provides that the commercial rates income of a local authority is capped in the year following revaluation, limiting the reasons for any increase in total local authority income from rates to the following: inflation; extensions to existing properties; and new properties coming on stream.  As a result, the revaluation of commercial properties in a Local Authority area is essentially a revenue neutral exercise concerned with the redistribution of the rates liability between ratepayers by reference to the net annual value of the commercial property they occupy. </p>  <p>  As a result of Section 56 of the Valuation Act, 2001, as amended, and the shift in relative values of various property types and uses between the late 1980's and the valuation date of 1 March 2012, some 65% of ratepayers in the Limerick City and County Council rating authority area have had a reduction in their rates liability while 35% have had an increase.  This is more or less in line with the outcome in other recently revalued rating authority areas.</p>  <p>  The trend of change in liability occurred across a range of property uses and is not confined to the categories of property to which the Deputy refers.  The question of the Commissioner adopting a different approach to the valuation of certain categories of property which receive public support does not arise as all valuations determined by the Valuation Office in all sectors are carried out solely in accordance with the valuation principles prescribed by section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001.  Government policy in relation to support of the areas mentioned does not play any part in the determination of values under the Act.</p>  <p>  Revaluation is not a new policy and is being carried out under legislation enacted in 2001.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his function under the Valuation Acts, 2001 to 2015 and the carrying out of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative.  The Act does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard.  I would not be aware of the values emerging for different sectors before the final valuation list is published and the legislation provides for an extensive appeals process.  The carrying out of a Regulatory Impact Assessment does not therefore arise.</p></reply>

The final values attributed to wind energy farms would, after the application of the Annual Rate on Valuation, determined by the local authority, result in a substantial increase in the rates bill for these properties.  In parallel with the Limerick revaluation, Minister of State Harris was bringing the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 through the Oireachtas on my behalf. </p>  <p>  There were a number of consultations in February and March between my officials and relevant stakeholders including the Irish Wind Energy Association and the Irish Wind Farmers Association regarding the increase in rates and whether changes could be made to the legislation that was going through the Oireachtas at that time.  There was also substantial correspondence from interested parties up until the Bill was passed on 14 April 2015.  The matter was also raised at D&aacute;il Committee and Report Stages of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.</p>  <p>  The Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources were made aware of the concerns that were being expressed by the wind energy sector and the calls that were being made for amendments to the legislation. </p>  <p>  There was no working group established to consider the valuation process.  The Commissioner of Valuation is responsible for the drawing up and maintenance of valuation lists and is completely independent in the exercise of his functions.  Valuations are made in accordance with the provisions of the Valuation Act 2001 and I have no function in the valuation process.  The role of the Commissioner is to draw up a valuation list which local authorities can use to allocate the rates burden on a fair and independent basis.  There would have been no role for a working group to consider the valuation process. </p>  <p>  The valuations made on wind energy farms are the subject of appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation as provided for in the Valuation Act 2001.  I and my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are aware of the concerns raised by the sector but we are also conscious of the need to respect the appeals processes that are provided and not to pre-judge the outcome of those procedures.  This was made clear in the D&aacute;il on Committee and Report Stages and when Minister Harris stated in conclusion at Report Stage on 31 March 2015.  "We should allow the appeals process to take its course.  A number of appeals are under active consideration. Let us see what arises from them and fully assess the impact.  If there is a need for a policy change, let us consider it".  When the outcome to the appeals process is known my Department will communicate with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation to any issues that might  arise for energy policy.  </p>  <p>  There was no direct contact between my Department and counterparts in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The Valuation Office are in regular contact with their counterparts in other jurisdictions and meet on a regular basis to discuss, in a general way, matters of mutual interest.  During the consultations that led up to the finalisation of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 the Valuation Office did contact their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Scotland to get basic information on the trends in valuations of wind farms.  This information showed that there has also been substantial increases in valuations in Northern Ireland following their recent revaluation but the valuations are not directly comparable as they have different legislation and their valuations would have been made with reference to the circumstances prevailing on different valuation dates.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.494.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000074#WRJ01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 280 together.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Office completed its revaluation of Limerick at the end of 2014.  This is part of a programme that will see the valuation of all commercial properties in the State brought up to date, by reference to modern property values, and maintained on a rolling 5-10 year cycle of revaluations as provided for in the Valuation Act 2001.  The revaluation of commercial properties in a Local Authority area is about redistributing the rates burden with each ratepayer's liability reflecting modern property valuations.  A revaluation is not about raising extra revenue from rates, and local authorities are prohibited from doing so in the year following a revaluation.  I am aware that the Limerick revaluation has led to large increases in the valuation of wind farms which could, subject to appeal, see the rates liability on those wind farms rise by c.200%.</p>  <p>  Wind farms in other counties are not directly impacted by this revaluation.  Valuation lists are compiled for each Local Authority area and are used by Local Authorities in the calculation of rates but the value assigned is only one element in that calculation.  The Annual Rate on Valuation, the relative movements in the values of other categories of property and whether the valuation list is made up of properties that are generally increasing in value or decreasing in value all feed into the whether an individual's or a sectors' rates bill increases or decreases.  For example the outcome for wind farms in a county where the value of other properties has generally fallen is much different from the outcome in a county where other values are rising.</p>  <p>  The appeals process has not concluded its consideration of the recent revaluation in Limerick so one cannot even be certain of what the final outcome will be in that county, let alone making assumptions for the rest of the country.  While every effort is being made to accelerate the revaluation process, and the recent enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 is part of those efforts, no additional county will complete revaluation before the end of 2016, impacting on rates for 2017 at the earliest.  </p>  <p>  Revaluation is not like the imposition of a new tax where an ex-ante evaluation might be conducted in the form of a cost-benefit analysis.  The objective of a revaluation is not about raising extra revenue so the consideration of extra revenue from rates as against the impact that raising it may have on any sector does not arise.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions and I have no role in the valuation of properties for rates purposes.  I would not be aware of the emerging outcome of a revaluation before it is finalised and it would be improper to start conducting analyses on the impact on any sector prior to the finalisation of the valuation list.  There is an extensive appeals process in place for those who feel that the valuation assigned to a property is incorrect.  The legislation provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, a subsequent appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</p>  <p>  I and my colleague the Minister for Communications Energy and Natural resources are aware of the concerns raised by the wind farm sector but we are also conscious of the need to respect the appeals processes that are provided and not to pre-judge the outcome of those procedures.  The potential impact on the sector, of the revaluation in Limerick was raised at both D&aacute;il Committee and Report Stages of the Valuation (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012, which has since been enacted.  As Minister of State Harris stated in conclusion at Report Stage on 31 March 2015.  "We should allow the appeals process to take its course.  A number of appeals are under active consideration.  Let us see what arises from them and fully assess the impact.  If there is a need for a policy change, let us consider it".</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.503.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000074#WRJ02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 to 285, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  These questions all relate to the methodology used in the valuation of wind farms.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Office, as part of a programme that will see the valuation of all commercial properties in the State brought up to date, by reference to modern property values, and maintained on a rolling 5-10 year cycle of revaluations as provided for in the Valuation Act 2001, has recently revalued all commercial properties in the rating authority area of Limerick City and County Council by reference to a valuation date of 1 March 2012.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions and I as Minister have no function in the valuation of property for rates purposes, or in any appeal against a valuation.  The purpose of a revaluation of commercial properties in a local authority area is the redistribution of the rates burden with each ratepayer's liability reflecting up-to-date property rental values. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Limerick revaluation as it has applied to wind farms may, subject to appeal, see the rates liability of those facilities increase significantly.  Wind farms in other counties are not directly impacted by the Limerick revaluation.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, a subsequent appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law, for all valuations carried out under that Act.  I understand that the valuations of all the Limerick wind farms have been appealed to the Commissioner of Valuation and that those appeals will be decided in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The basis of rateable valuation for all property is net annual value, as set out in Part 11 of the Valuation Act, 2001.  Net annual value is the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes and charges (if any) payable by or under any enactment in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property.</p>  <p>  In accordance with well-established valuation principles and case law, various methodologies may be used in estimating the Net Annual Value of a property.  One commonly used method is known as the Receipts and Expenditure method of valuation where trading accounts relating to the use of a particular property are analysed to arrive at the Net Annual Value.  Another method of valuation used from time to time, depending on the particular circumstances and type of property involved, is the Contractor's method where the annual equivalent of the cost of construction, allowing for depreciation as appropriate, and the value of the site, is used to arrive at the Net Annual Value.  </p>  <p>  I understand that as regards the Limerick wind farms the Valuation Office sought information on construction and development costs and detailed trading information for each facility and that this information was used in drawing up the valuation scheme for the Limerick wind farms.  The correctness or otherwise of the valuation approach taken is now being considered as part of the appeals process. </p>  <p>  All the assumptions made in the carrying out of the valuation of wind farms in the Limerick City and County Council rating authority area are those set out in Section 48 of the Valuation Act, 2001.  What has to be decided in a revaluation is the most appropriate method of valuation to arrive at the Net Annual Value for a particular property type. Regarding the reference by the Deputy to the profitability of wind farms and the relationship to rates, the concept of profitability, as understood by the occupier or operator of a wind farm or indeed any other commercial property, can vary significantly from the concept as understood and used in a Receipts and Expenditure valuation to determine a valuation in accordance with section 48 of the Act.</p>  <p>  As already stated, the valuation date for Limerick City and County Council area revaluation is 1 March 2012.  I am advised by the Valuation office that the oldest wind farms in Limerick date from c. 2008.  As a result, no adjustment was made to revenues to reflect market price after 15 years to take account of REFIT.  Furthermore, section 25 of the Act also provides that once a rating authority area has been revalued, not less than 5 years and no more than 10 years, must elapse before the next revaluation takes place.  Therefore all rateable property in the rating authority area of Limerick City and County Council area will be revalued again between 2019 and 2024.</p>  <p>  While the Receipts and Expenditure method of valuation was considered the most appropriate method of valuation to value the Limerick wind farms as well as some other categories of property, the Contractor's method of valuation was used to value the Huntstown power station in Finglas.  However the Fingal revaluation, which was published in 2009, had a September 2005 valuation date in contrast with Limerick which has a valuation date of 1 March 2012.  While the figures of net annual value per MW quoted by the Deputy are accurate, and net annual value per MW as a unit of comparison between wind farms in the same rating authority area may be valid, it is not a valid form of comparison to use with a fossil fuel electricity generating facility.  Such a comparison is further compounded when the facilities are located in different rating authority areas with different valuation dates.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is asking if legislative change will be made for the wind farm industry.  I and my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are aware of the concerns raised by the sector but we are also conscious of the need to respect the appeals processes that are provided and not to pre-judge the outcome of those procedures.  This was made clear in the D&aacute;il at Committee and Report Stages and when Minister Harris stated in conclusion at Report Stage on 31 March 2015.  "We should allow the appeals process to take its course.  A number of appeals are under active consideration.  Let us see what arises from them and fully assess the impact. If there is a need for a policy change, let us consider it".  When the outcome to the appeals process is known my Department will communicate with the Department of Communications,  Energy and Natural Resources in relation to any issues that might arise for energy policy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.506.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000074#WRJ02500"><p>At the outset, I wish to make clear that persons in civil partnerships or in same sex marriages are not discriminated against under any aspect of the public service pension scheme. </p>  <p>  The public service operates a Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme.  This provides benefits to Spouses or Children of deceased members. In summary, when a member dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one-half of the former member's pension is payable.  Dependent children are also entitled to a child's pension of one-third of the spouse's pension for each of the first three eligible children.</p>  <p>  The original pre 1984 scheme did not allow for the payment of a pension to a spouse who married or had children post retirement.  Thus, the scheme allowed a refund of contributions if the individual had not been married up to the point of retirement. </p>  <p>  In 1984, a revised Scheme which extended eligibility for benefits to spouses who married or had children after retirement was introduced and members of the original scheme and certain retirees were given the option of transferring to the revised Scheme, which became obligatory for subsequent recruits.</p>  <p>  One of the benefits of the Revised Scheme was that the spouse of a post retirement marriage was eligible for a spouse's pension.  The disadvantage of the Scheme was that there was no facility for repayment of contributions on retirement if the individual concerned did not have a spouse and would not therefore be in a position to avail of any benefit under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  For members who remained in the original Scheme there was an entitlement to claim a refund of contributions in the event that the member remained unmarried at the date of retirement.  Many members of the scheme availed of this option and received a refund.</p>  <p>  Across the entire public service, approximately 30,000 staff who were not members and an unquantified number who had been members of the original scheme opted not to join the new scheme.  Their reasons for doing so were presumably varied, including not expecting to marry, being in a relationship with a separated person who was not then able to divorce, or that it was personally more beneficial to them not to join the new scheme.  For example, women were not prior to 1984 required to join the pension scheme and pay contributions; they may have decided that was better financially for them.</p>  <p>  In recent years, some individuals have sought to reverse the decision they made at that point.  More specifically, a number of people have argued that they could not have envisaged that same-sex civil partnerships would be legalised in the state. </p>  <p>  A fundamental element of any new opt-in would have to be that it would have be open to all applicants regardless of their reasons for not opting-in the first place.  This would be required to avoid alternative claims of discrimination.  Every then serving and retired public servant who opted to remain in the old scheme, or chose not to join either scheme, would have to be given the opportunity to opt into the new scheme. </p>  <p>  Public service spouses' and children's schemes are structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.  Given the passage of time since 1984 and the greater clarity those who opted out then will now have about their lives, it is eminently foreseeable that only those persons whose spouses and/or children would benefit would opt in.  This would radically undermine the group insurance basis of the scheme. </p>  <p>  There is no way of knowing how many people would decide to opt in.  As an example of potential costs, the spouse and children of a pensioner who opted out in 1984 and retired age 60 with a full 40 years' service in 2010 and a final salary of &euro;50,000 would be entitled to a spouse's pension of &euro;12,500 per annum, and a children's pension of  one-third of the spouse's pension for each of the first three eligible children, in this case up to &euro;12,500 per annum, a total of &euro;25,000 for each year the pensions remained in payment.  The cost of a thousand such cases would be &euro;25m per annum and of 10,000 would be &euro;250m per annum.</p>  <p>  To offset costs, an upfront fee could be levied on those who chose to opt in.  However, the fee for opting in either could not cover the additional cost of the pensions involved or, alternatively, would have to be so large that it would be unfeasible for many persons to pay it.  </p>  <p>  My Department's position has also been that if decisions freely made about pensions or other matters could be reversed at any time this would have grave consequences for public administration.  Where changes have been made to pension schemes, individuals have only been allowed to opt in to the new arrangements at the time of the introduction of the new scheme.  This approach is in line with that of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</p></reply>

The 2004 Act provides for the establishment of the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) and of the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  PAS - an independent statutory body - provides a centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the civil service.  This recruitment model ensures that core principles of public service recruitment such as, for example, probity and fairness underpin the recruitment process.  In specific terms, under the Codes of Practice prescribed by the CPSA appointments into the public service must be made in accordance with the principle of merit.  In practice this means that candidates are ranked based on their performance in the competitive recruitment process, and are then offered appointments in order of merit.  On that basis, the type of information referred to in the Deputy's question is not routinely collected or monitored.  Indeed, in addition to privacy concerns, in the circumstances that high standards of public service recruitment are in place and implemented in practice, the rationale for compiling such information is not evident.</p></reply>

Their interactions when lobbied must be reported by the lobbyists in accordance with the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  My Department in conjunction with the Standards Commission is currently in the process of drafting guidance to ensure that designated public officials understand how the system works, how they fit into it and their part in supporting the effective implementation of the arrangements.  This guidance is available in draft form on .  In addition, my Department and the Standards Commission are holding a series of information sessions for designated public officials and a session specifically for TDs and Senators has been arranged for Thursday 9 July in Leinster House.</p><p>It is my view that lobbying is an essential part of the democratic process.  Organisations such as interest groups, representative bodies, industry, NGOs, charities and third party professional lobbyists all provide necessary input and feedback through communication of the views and concerns of the public to government.  This interaction is a welcome and necessary element of policy development.  I would urge public bodies to continue to actively facilitate and encourage such communications to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>The Act does not aim to prevent or inhibit lobbying activity.  Its objective is to make the process more transparent while supporting the interaction of public bodies with all stakeholder organisations.  I am a strong advocate of lobbying activity.  I believe that lobbying is absolutely necessary in order to maintain a healthy and well-functioning democracy.  The extent of lobbying activity is a good measure of an engaged citizenry but it should be open to public scrutiny as part of the desirable checks and balances in a democracy. </p><p>Transparency is our strongest weapon in discouraging attempts to seek to exert undue or improper influence on the conduct of policy formulation.  There is a strong public interest in identifying &quot;who is lobbying whom about what&quot;.  My intention in designing and guiding this legislation to enactment was specifically to achieve this goal.</p><p>With regard to the specific point raised in the Deputy's question, I am very aware, for example, of the substantial work carried out by the OECD in analysing and assessing the regulation of lobbying drawing on international experience.  Indeed, the OECD's principles on international best practice were strongly reflected in the approach adopted to the development of the Regulation of Lobbying Act, 2015.  I am not, however, aware of specific and detailed recommendations from authoritative international organisations (such as the OECD) to which the Deputy's question refers.  Indeed, I understand that our Regulation of Lobbying legislation is considered by international experts as strongly reflecting an effective approach to substantially enhancing the transparency of the lobbying process.</p><p>Finally, I am aware that the Council of Europe's European Committee on Legal Co-operation is currently in the process of drafting a recommendation on the legal regulation of lobbying activities for members and my Department has contributed to this drafting process through the submission of views on preliminary drafts.  My Department will continue to carefully monitor progress on this draft recommendation.  Any final recommendation from this process would not in any event supersede the statutory position as set out in national legislation.</p></reply>

It sets out the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives as a facilitator within the Irish entrepreneurship ecosystem.  The Statement covers the six key elements that impact on entrepreneurs and start-ups and signposts the direction that policy will take in the coming years.  This Policy Statement represents the first time a Government has published a comprehensive national plan for entrepreneurship in Ireland.</p><p>A key strategic objective of the Policy Statement is to ensure that greater numbers of people, particularly in under-represented cohorts such as youths, start and run their own business. </p><p>The Entrepreneurship Policy Statement contains a number of specific actions in order to ensure that more people, including young people, have an equal opportunity to start and run their own business. </p><p>I am personally driving and chairing the Implementation Group, comprised of senior officials from the key Departments and agencies, charged with oversight and delivery of the actions set out in the National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.</p><p>The specific objectives for 2015 are to:</p><p>- Progress the actions from the National Entrepreneurship Policy;</p><p>- Utilise the New Frontiers Programme optimally to support emerging entrepreneurs</p><p>- Continue to promote LEO&rsquo;s as one stop shops for small business; and</p><p>- Develop an action programme of support for pre-investment HPSUs.</p><p>- Develop an Entrepreneurial PhD programme with a view to training more scientists in SFI supported research teams to launch their own businesses. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for assisting start-ups, business development and job creation in each local area.  Since anyone can access the LEO supports, data by age category is not available.  Further information on LEO supports for business ideas can be found on the LEO website at <i>.</i></p><p><i></i>Specifically the LEOs have been driving the competition to find &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur&rdquo; (IBYE) 2015, which the Taoiseach and I launched last month.  This competition is<b></b>designed to foster a culture of entrepreneurship among young people in Ireland and to encourage the establishment of new innovative businesses by Ireland&rsquo;s best young entrepreneurs.  A &euro;2 million investment fund is available nationally and we are looking to improve on the 1,012 applications that were received last year.</p><p>The initial stage is a County-based competition leading to the naming of the Best Young Entrepreneur in each County.  This stage involves the hosting of Entrepreneurship Boot-camps at local/regional level, where entrants will receive expert training and mentoring advice and have their business proposals assessed.  The competition is open to individuals aged 30 and under.</p><p>The winners at County level will be eligible for an investment in their business of up to &euro;25,000, while the winners at National level can receive an additional investment of up to &euro;50,000, with one business-person being crowned &ldquo;Best Young Entrepreneur in Ireland&rdquo; before the end of the year.</p><p>I would urge any person under 30 who has a business or a business idea to contact their local LEO or visit IBYE.ie and apply to become Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur for 2015.  The deadline to apply for this year&rsquo;s IBYE competition is Friday, July 31.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland supports are available to all entrepreneurs, including young people, whose ideas and business plans are capable of internationalising in manufacturing and internationally traded services.</p><p>In 2014, Enterprise Ireland supported 183 new and early stage start-ups.  These are ambitious companies, with innovative products and business development strategies that will enable them to carve out a place in global markets. Enterprise Ireland has set itself an ambitious target of 550 new and early stage start-ups supported over the period 2014 to 2016.</p><p>No one policy intervention will generate substantial impact on the entrepreneurship ecosystem, but various actions if taken together will combine to create greater synergies.  The over-arching National Entrepreneurship Statement serves to co-ordinate all areas of Government policy in the area of entrepreneurship to drive these synergies and will deliver on increasing Youth Entrepreneurship.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.532.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000075#WRK00800"><p>The question which the Deputy has put down, supported by accompanying documentation, relates to the ability to enforce Intellectual Property Rights in Ireland.  This issue has been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s direct attention and, given that the matter raised involves legal considerations, has also been the subject of advice from the office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  The documentation refers to the Directive on Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights &ndash; Directive 2004/48/EC &ndash; and specifically to Articles 2 and 3 and Recital 17 thereof which, it is claimed, Ireland has failed to implement.  These Articles require EU Member States to provide for measures, procedures and remedies to ensure enforcement of intellectual property rights.  The measures must be fair and equitable, not unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time limits or unwarranted delay.  In Ireland, the requirements under Articles 2 and 3 of the Enforcement Directive are covered by the general jurisdictional powers of the Courts and did not necessitate any specific legislative measures in Irish law.</p>  <p>  Ireland transposed the EU Enforcement Directive in 2006 through Regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972 entitled European Communities (Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights) Regulation 2006 - S.I. no. 360 of 2006.  In the usual manner, the transposition process was completed in conjunction with advice and guidance from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  When the Regulations transposing the Directive were effected, the Department notified these to the EU Commission in compliance with the procedures operated by the Commission for notification Ireland&rsquo;s national measure implementing the Directive.  Subsequently, the EU Commission examined the transposition of the Enforcement Directive in all Member States and published a Report in 2010 analysing the transposition and implementation of the Directive in all EU Member States.  In its Report the Commission did not raise any issues in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s transposition and implementation of the Directive.  </p>  <p>  At the heart of the complaint outlined in the documentation is the claim that enforcement of Intellectual Property rights in Ireland is very difficult because it is not possible for small firms to bring low value cases (under &euro;15k) to court without solicitors and barristers and the associated costs which that entails.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Enforcement Directive does not contain provisions dealing with the question of whether individuals, or companies, must be represented by lawyers having a right of audience when they bring proceedings to enforce their intellectual property rights.  It is the case that, at present, under Irish law, the general rule is that a company must be represented in litigation before the District Court by a lawyer with a right of audience.  Of course, this issue applies across the board to all cases that are litigated before the District Court and is much wider than intellectual property law.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I do not take lightly the matters raised in the documentation in terms of costs associated with accessing justice before the Courts, particularly for low-value claims of the nature contained in the documentation.  The Deputy will appreciate that in general, the issue of the jurisdiction of the courts and of costs associated with litigation are not aspects that come within my Department&rsquo;s direct responsibility.  Nonetheless, I have directed my officials to pursue the issue with officials in the relevant Department to examine options to improve the situation as it impacts on the area of intellectual property for which I have responsibility.  You will be aware also of the current passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Legal Services Regulation Bill under the steerage of the Minister for Justice and Equality which is pertinent also in this area.  The Bill seeks to bring about a reduction in legal professional fees which has been widely advocated.  Further cost reductions in these fees will assist companies taking legal actions before the Courts to invigilate their rights.</p>  <p>  Separately, I understand that the issue of legal representation before the District Court is an issue that has been drawn to the attention of the Company Law Review Group.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.535.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000075#WRK01100"><p>The matters that have been in dispute at Dunnes Stores have revolved around a range of issues, including the introduction of banded hours contracts, individual and collective representational rights and a review of the use of temporary contracts.  The matter has been before the Labour Court on a number of occasions.  It is my opinion that engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way whereby the parties involved in disputes can hope to resolve their differences.  Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.</p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and I expect it to be enacted before the summer recess.  The Bill provides for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions governing terms and conditions in individual enterprises.  Such agreements will not be legally binding beyond the subscribing parties.  The Bill also provides for a new statutory framework to replace the former sectoral Registered Employment Agreements (REAs).  The Bill will further provide a mechanism for workers who seek to improve their terms and conditions in companies where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employer.  When enacted it will ensure that such workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies.  The Bill includes strong anti-victimisation protections.</p>  <p>  In relation to zero hour contracts, I have commissioned the University of Limerick (UL) to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts and the impact of such contracts on employees.  The key objectives of the study are:</p>  <p>  - To fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use</p>  <p>  - To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees</p>  <p>  - To enable the Minister to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  The study has a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors.  It will fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy.  The study will examine how such contracts operate in practice and assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee.  It will also assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts, and consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.  The findings will enable me to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  A wide range of stakeholders is being canvassed to contribute to the study, which I expect to be completed by the end of the Summer.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study, or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings.</p></reply>

For reasons of commercial sensitivity and client confidentiality IDA Ireland does not comment on upcoming site visits by potential investors.</p><p>Westmeath is marketed as part of the Midlands Region which also comprises counties Longford, Laois and Offaly.</p><p>IDA Ireland is and will continue to market the Mullingar Business and Technology Park through its network of overseas offices and present it to potential clients where the facility is considered to be a suitable property solution to meet their needs.</p><p>I understand from IDA Ireland that the office park in Marlinstown is not an IDA Ireland Business and Technology Park.  However, I have been assured by the Agency that it is also happy to promote the property to a potential and suitable investor should the opportunity arise.</p><p>Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s Business and Technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.  An advanced office building is planned for 2017 for Co. Westmeath as part of the programme.</p><p>In February, the Government announced details of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs: Regional</i>initiative which seeks to capitalise on the strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation.  The initiative will build on the success of the National Action Plan for Jobs, and encourage regional stakeholders - including enterprise agencies, Local Authorities, higher education institutions, other public bodies and the private sector - to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their own region. </p><p>In total, eight regional Action Plans will be developed and published this year.  The first of these plans for the Midlands region covering counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath was launched on Monday 29th June.  This plan sets out almost 120 actions aimed to deliver enhanced employment growth in the region over the coming years with a target of increasing employment in the region by 10-15 % by 2020.  IDA has been tasked with attracting 25-30 additional FDI investment projects into the region over the next 5 years while Enterprise Ireland is to increase the number of start-ups by 25% by increasing their flow of start-up companies through enterprise hubs and onto Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s competitive programmes.  The overall ambition of the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Midland Region is to increase employment by approximately 14,000 by 2020.</p></reply>

I also re-iterate my statement on the independence of the performance of the functions of Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority set down in section 46 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, as made in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 218 of 6 May. </p>  <p>  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is accountable to D&aacute;il Committees and Section 68 of the Act provides that the Authority from time to time, and whenever so requested shall account for the performance of the functions of the Authority to a Committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas and shall have regard to any recommendations of such Committee relevant to its functions.  A specific complaints procedure is also provided for under Section 49 of the Act.  This allows the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority to appoint one or more persons from outside the Authority as &ldquo;Complaints Officers&rdquo; to consider and furnish a report on any complaint made by a member of the public in relation to the enforcement of sea-fisheries law or food safety law.  The Authority is required to consider such a report and advise the complainant and the Complaints Officer of its decision in the matter.  It should be noted however, that a complaint cannot be considered if the matter relates to proceedings before a court or other tribunal or if it is not made within 28 days after the subject matter of the complaint arose or if it is the subject of a complaint to the Ombudsman or an appeal to the Information commissioner. </p>  <p>  Both the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Marine Institute are important agencies in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s role in the Common Fisheries Policy and the regulatory and advisory work of the respective agencies is held in high regard across the EU and internationally.</p></reply>

The Programme forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP) and allocates funding of some &euro;300 million over the next six years to suckler farmers in Ireland.  The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the overall genetic quality of the national beef herd.  While analysis of the applications is still ongoing, the initial figures suggest that the programme is fully subscribed.</p><p>The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and most of the actions will already be familiar to the majority of farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements.  Both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers.  Programme participants can contact my Department directly with any specific queries they may have regarding scheme conditions.  In addition, they will also receive additional information specific to their herds in the coming weeks from ICBF which will provide a useful overview of the current euro star ratings of the animals on their herds. </p><p>Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for each of the first eligible 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each of the remaining hectares up to the maximum payable area.  The maximum payable area is based on the number of calved suckler cows in each herd in 2014.  The payment rates provide for a higher payment linked to the first 10 animals on each herd as I felt it was important to favour smaller herds through this programme.  The payment rate of &euro;142.50 is the maximum amount which could be provided based on the cost incurred and income foregone associated with the actions under the BDGP, as negotiated with the European Commission, and it would not be possible to arbitrarily increase the payment. </p><p>The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP over and above existing schemes for the suckler beef sector.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and farmer margins.  The requirement for farmers to move towards using 4 and 5 star rated animals is essential to the Programme&rsquo;s objectives of delivering cows that perform better in terms of fertility and milk traits.  Furthermore, any adjustment to these provisions would require engagement with the Commission and would jeopardise the operation of the programme.  In any event, I should note that many farmers are already well on the way to meeting the 4 and 5 star requirement.  In addition, all participants will receive comprehensive training, and ongoing information and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy.  These requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time included in the design of the Programme. </p><p>As regards the penalty system, it is important to note that it includes appropriate tolerances where minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will be applied in these cases.  In more serious cases, however, a penalty will be applied.  I am satisfied that the approach reflects a proportionate response consistent with the Regulations.  The requirement to seek full refund of payment applies only in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme.  As always in such cases, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is caused by circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control, such as illness or animal disease.  My Department has also confirmed that where an applicant sells or leases his/her land, or transfers it by inheritance or gift, there will be no clawback of funds. Of course, where an applicant retains sufficient land to fulfil the requirements of the Programme (the maximum payable area), he or she is required to continue to meet its terms and conditions on an ongoing basis. </p><p>Almost 30,000 farmers have already successfully applied for the programme and there will be detailed engagement with these farmers in the coming years, starting with each farmer being provided with a BDGP Herd Status Report for their farm in the coming weeks.  Comprehensive training courses will then be rolled out later this year.  I can assure the Deputy that participants in the BDGP will receive information and guidance on an ongoing basis to assist them in meeting the requirements of the programme and ultimately improving the quality of their herds.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.618.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000076#WRL02500"><p>There is very considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine TB.  Research conducted over the years by the Department and others has demonstrated that the eradication of bovine TB disease is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed.  It is therefore necessary to eradicate TB in both species.  In view of this, the comprehensive TB Eradication Programme as implemented by my Department has incorporated a badger removal and population control policy since 2004.  </p>  <p>  I should emphasise that badgers are only removed in areas where an epidemiological investigation carried out by my Department&rsquo;s veterinary inspectorate has found that badgers are the likely source of the infection.  It is not the case that the badger culling programme is decimating the badger population; on an international scale Ireland is classified as having a medium density population of badgers as opposed to the very low and low densities throughout Europe generally and the medium to very high density levels seen in Great Britain.  My Department also monitors the animal welfare aspects of badger capture/culling on a continuous basis and is satisfied that the existing arrangements and procedures result in minimal injury to badgers.   </p>  <p>  While the current approach to badgers control is cost effective and has contributed significantly to the very significant improvement in the disease situation in recent years, the ultimate objective of my Department is to incorporate badger vaccination into the Irish TB eradication programme.  However, this strategy can only be deployed when data are available to ensure that this can be done in an optimally effective and sustainable manner.  In view of this, various projects, involving vaccine development and oral-delivery techniques are under way (including in collaboration with the United Kingdom), with a view to developing a viable badger TB-vaccine and vaccination strategy.  Considerable progress has already been made and vaccination by individual capture, with injection of human grade BCG vaccine, is already being deployed in 8 areas in the country involving over 8,000 km.  A process to measure the efficacy of this strategy is in train, but will take some time to complete. </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the implementation of badger vaccination on a national scale will depend on a number of critical factors, notably scientific evidence that badger vaccination is as effective as badger culling in preventing the spread of disease from badgers to cattle, the authorisation of an oral vaccine for badgers under veterinary medicines regulations and the identification of an efficient and effective oral-delivery method for that vaccine.  Standard requirements for authorisation necessitates proving that the vaccine and the chosen method of delivery fulfils criteria relating to safety, including safety in non-target species, efficacy, including duration of immunity, and quality.  As stated above, my Department is working very closely with DEFRA in the UK with a view to progressing these issues and is advancing the licensing process and the eight area vaccination programme in parallel.  I expect that significant progress can be made towards delivery of a fully authorised oral badger vaccine over the next 3 years.</p></reply>

This action plan is published on the Bord na gCon website.  </p><p>Bord na gCon has updated my Department as follows with regard to implementation of the action plan.</p><p>- In relation to governance, a Risk Facilitator has been appointed and a risk register has been developed which is reviewed on a quarterly basis.  Enhanced procedures have been introduced with regard to internal auditing, an internal audit tender is about to be launched and a staff survey has been conducted to review internal resources.</p><p>- With regard to the financial aspects, a plan for asset disposal<b></b>has been drawn up and due diligence has been carried out on all non-core assets.  Bord na gCon has submitted proposals to my Department for the disposal of its former headquarters at 104 Henry Street in Limerick.  The number of race nights or race meetings at poorly performing<b></b>stadia has been reduced and there is ongoing monitoring of performance at all stadia.  Bord na gCon is focusing on co-mingling and fixed odds wagering opportunities, having developed the required information technology.  Work is ongoing to increase commercial income at stadia and a budget has been committed to marketing with a view to boosting attendances.  Horse Sport Ireland has just concluded a very successful series of showjumping events in the Limerick, Cork and Shelbourne Park stadia.  Proposals to resolve the pension underfunding have been submitted to my Department for consideration and the proposals have been incorporated into the financial planning for 2015.</p><p>- With regard to regulatory reform, Bord na gCon has finalised a public consultation process with stakeholders with a view to publishing details of all adverse findings after positive results have been returned by the laboratory and prior to consideration by the Control Committee.  There has been an extensive review of procedures for regulatory control with many new standard operating procedures either finalised or close to finalisation dealing with sampling for prohibited substances, laboratory aspects, track maintenance, racetrack security and enforcement of penalties.  The work of an international expert in reviewing Bord na gCon&rsquo;s policy in anti-doping and medication control is nearing conclusion.  This may lead to the establishment of an advisory scientific group, amendments to legislation and a modification of practices and policies as appropriate.  The regime for testing for prohibited substances is being strengthened, and testing has commenced at trials.  In addition, I understand that more targeted testing on a risk basis has commenced.  Bord na gCon has also initiated a process to introduce mandatory penalties, including exclusion orders and disqualification orders, for breaches of regulations.</p><p>- With regard to welfare, Bord na gCon has commenced the process of strengthening the sanctions for animal cruelty.  It has taken its first successful prosecution under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 against an individual for failure to comply with a welfare notice issued by one of its welfare officers involving fines of &euro;2,500 and costs of &euro;1,500 being imposed at Nenagh District Court on 25 June 2015.  An online resource centre has been launched for <i>inter alia</i>the future publication of welfare information and notices as appropriate.  Bord na gCon will shortly go to public consultation on regulations to require records be kept of all medication administered to greyhounds.  It is proposed that failure to comply will be an offence under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.</p><p>My Department is in regular contact with Bord na gCon in relation to the implementation of the action plan.  I commissioned the Indecon report in recognition of the need to review and reform aspects of greyhound sector and I view it as critically important that its recommendations are implemented, with a view to ensuring that the greyhound industry can reach its full potential and prosper into the future.</p></reply>

As a general rule European alders are largely free from quarantine pest and disease problems.  Although not a regulated disease under the EU Plant Health Directive, one disease has gained particular prominence.  A disease of the Phytophthora species, known as alder Phytophthora (<i>Phytophtoraalni</i>), which is highly specific to alder is known to be widespread in Europe.  The disease was first identified in Britain in 1993 and surveys conducted by authorities there in recent years have shown the disease to be relatively widespread in riparian ecosystems, although the incidence is highest in southeast England and in parts of Wales.  The disease has also been recorded in Ireland in County Dublin.  </p><p>In the last five years there have been a number of incidences where signs or symptoms of disease or stress have been identified on alder plantings by Forestry Inspectors.  In all cases further investigations were undertaken.  On the two occasions where biotic causes of disease or stress were confirmed, these were identified as pathogens or insects naturally occurring in the Irish environment.  In the first incidence the Nut Bud Moth (<i>Epinotia tenerana</i>), a species of moth common to Ireland, was identified on the foliage of alder in County Wexford.  In the second, Fomes (<i>Heterobasidion annosum</i>), a common fungal disease causing root and butt rot of trees, was identified as affecting alder trees in County Kerry.</p><p>With regard to ongoing monitoring of pest and diseases, I can inform the Deputy that Forestry Inspectors in my Department carry out routine visual surveys for harmful pest and diseases throughout the national forest estate.  This work brings the Forestry Inspectorate into constant contact in the field with all stages of forestry operations throughout the country and across all tree species.  Details of these inspections are recorded on a standardised EU Forest Disease and Insect Survey, Sign/Symptom Report Form; where visual inspections are inconclusive, samples are taken for laboratory analysis.</p><p>The Department maintains a national pest and disease diagnostic and advisory service to forest owners.  This is an important survey component to enable the early detection of harmful pests and diseases.  The Department encourages tree owners to report unusual signs and symptoms and promotes the importance of maintaining the general health of forests.  Finally, all applications by landowners for afforestation support payments require written confirmation by a qualified forester, 4 years after planting, that there is no evidence of pest or disease problems.</p></reply>

These lands are designed as required under the provisions of Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds (1) and Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.  The designation does not require farmers to carry out specific practices.  The habitats, however, have associated Notifiable Actions or Activities Requiring Consent for which Ministerial consent must be sought if not regulated by another agency or Government Department.</p>  <p>  I have arranged for the compilation of details of payment reductions and penalties applied to farmers, who included land designated as Natura land, in their application under the Single Payment Scheme since 2010.  It must, however, be noted that it is not possible to isolate the Natura land in the payment reduction and penalty calculation.  In 2014, for example, the farmers, who declared 534,000 hectares of Natura land claimed a total of over 1.5 million hectares under the Single Payment Scheme.  Some land parcels contain both Natura and non-Natura land and the total area of the parcels in question amounted to over 920,000 hectares of which 534,000 is Natura.  I will arrange to provide this data to the Deputy when it is established.   </p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind also that while some of the exclusions relate to scrub, significant areas were excluded for payment purposes under the Scheme, as they were abandoned.  In the case of the hen harrier habitats, for example, it is important that the land does not become abandoned given the harrier also needs a mosaic of open areas extended beyond the areas of scrub identified in habitat map. </p>  <p>  The EU Regulations provide that where areas have become ineligible for payment and this is due to compliance with Special Protection Areas (SPA) or Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) management requirements these areas will continue to be eligible for payment provided that:</p>  <p>-  the newly ineligible area was due to compliance with SPA and SAC requirements;</p>  <p>-  the area in question was declared on a 2008 SPS application form;</p>  <p>-  the area was declared as eligible to draw down an SPS payment in 2008;</p>  <p>-  the applicant who declared that land on a 2008 SPS application form was paid under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme.   </p>  <p>  Any farmer, who had areas of Natura land deemed ineligible for payment under the Direct Payment Scheme, can submit an appeal to my Department (LPIS Appeals Section (Natura), Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise, Co Laois.

Registration of the land in Coillte's name is a matter for the company.  I understand that the registration of the lands transferred to the company in 1993 is progressing. </p></reply>

In that regard the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service will honour all existing immigration permissions of students in recently closed colleges and the students will be entitled to work in accordance with the rules for student migration.  However, it is expected that students will make efforts to continue their studies and if they are seeking to stay on at the end of their current permission their study record would be an important consideration.  Where a student is seeking to renew their immigration permission at the expiry of their current permission they should note that they will be required to demonstrate that they have enrolled on a new course at a new college.  This should be done in good time prior to the expiry of the permission.  It is recognised that some students may, through no fault of their own, be unable to access the usual documents required to renew their registration, notably attendance documents, however allowances will be made in such cases.  </p>  <p>  Contractually the relationship as such is between a private individual and a private company.  Students, whether in Ireland or in their home country, should pursue all legal options available to them to recover any monies owed to them by one of the closed colleges. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on foot of proposals I brought forward, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, the Government approved the implementation of a series of reforms to the student immigration system for international education, in response to concerning practices within certain parts of the sector and a number of English language college closures.  The reforms are designed to drive real, lasting change in the sector and will tackle abuse of the immigration regime and labour market, improve the overall quality of offering to international students, and improve protection for learners, whilst safeguarding the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers in line with the goals of Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy.  A key element of these new rules is the introduction of a number of measures designed to protect students including compulsory learner protection arrangements and a separate account facility to safeguard student advance payments.</p></reply>

Other illegally present migrants are returned under the IVARRP programme (irregular voluntary assisted return and reintegration programme), which is part funded by the EU on a 50/50 basis. </p><p>Under these programmes, the flights home for such persons are paid and where required, the IOM will assist<b></b>in securing travel documents and give assistance at the airport at departure and arrival.</p><p>Persons planning to return voluntarily under these programme can apply for reintegration assistance before they depart which they can then access once they have returned to their home country.  Irish reintegration assistance is in the form of a payment in kind, for example help starting up a small business, or to revive an existing one, vocational training classes or educational courses.  The value of this reintegration assistance for single individuals is up to &euro;600 and for families up to &euro;1000.</p><p>To date IOM Ireland has assisted nearly 4,000 migrants to voluntarily return in a dignified and humane manner to 96 countries or origin since the opening of the IOM Dublin office in 2001.  The 2015 budget allocation for the VARRP programme is &euro;769,169 (i.e. for the 12 month period from the beginning of January 2015 until the end of December 2015).  The IVARRP budget agreed with the EU Commission from the beginning of March 2014 until the end of February 2015 was &euro;771,230.

The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme is an innovative prevention and early intervention initiative consisting of committed funding for an area-based approach to helping to improve outcomes for children and thereby impacting on child poverty.  The ABC Programme is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies on a matched basis with &euro;29.7m being provided over the life-cycle of the programme.</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme targets investment in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in areas of disadvantage.  It aims to break &ldquo;the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions&rdquo; in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage.  13 Sites were approved for entry into programme and are now operationalising services in their consortia sites.</p>  <p>  I am especially interested in the learning yield from the ABC programme and specifically how best we ensure the identification and transfer of this learning into established services and supports for children and young people.  With specific regard to this, my Department has established a task-focused group to examine how best to mainstream the learning from the ABC programme in the domains of policy and provision to improve outcomes for children and young people.  This Task Group includes representatives from The Atlantic Philanthropies and ABC sites.  The Task Group will explore how the mainstreaming of the learning from effective evidence-informed approaches can best be progressed.  It is anticipated that the group will provide a succinct discussion paper outlining feasible options relating to the mainstreaming of learning for the consideration of the ABC Interdepartmental Project Team in the last quarter of 2015.</p>  <p>  With regard to broader funding provided by The Atlantic Philanthropies, this is a matter for that organisation to consider and I understand that The Atlantic Philanthropies have had specific regard to this issue in their funding provision in recent years.</p></reply>

Through the establishment of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium, cross-Government commitment and accountability for shared actions will be achieved.

This is monitored through regular reporting, planning and review to ensure progress and momentum over the course of the Framework.</p><p>In the development of the Implementation Plan for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>, all Government Departments and Agencies with lead responsibility for commitments in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>were asked to set out the specific actions which they would be undertaking in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to achieve each of their commitments.  They were also asked to provide a comment on the desired outcome for 2017 for each commitment.</p><p>By their nature, the commitments in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>vary considerably in scope and scale.  Some are ongoing business for Departments and Agencies, while others represent new initiatives.  Some are straightforward and readily actionable, while others require considerable planning, development and cultural change.

As this significant policy framework impacts on all of society, it is imperative that the community and voluntary sector have a strong role in its implementation.  This is achieved through the Advisory Council.  The Advisory Council provides a forum for the community and voluntary sector and independent experts to engage with the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and its constituent elements to actively inform and support the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. </i>The Council consists of four constituent groupings with representatives from the following sectors: Early Years; Children; Youth; and independent experts.</p><p>The Advisory Council was the final piece of the implementation structures to be established.  The Council is chaired by Dr Owen Keenan, and their first meeting was held on 5 November 2014.  The second was held in December 2014, where the Sponsors Group presented the cross-sectoral priorities for 2015 to the Sponsors.  Subsequent meetings were held in January, February, April and June 2015.  In April, drafts of the <i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision Making, </i>and the <i>National Youth Strategy </i>were presented to the Council, and in June the Council discussed another significant DCYA-led policy initiative in Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees.</p><p>The Advisory Council are convening regularly as they work towards establishing their role within the overall implementation process.

In 2015, funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.</p><p>Three of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme, were the subject of a recently completed <i>Value for Money and Policy Review.</i>The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  In 2015, expenditure on the schemes will amount to &euro;34m.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for on-going public funding. </p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  It recommends that the three schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities.  It sets out guidance as to how services may be developed to better meet the needs of young people in the target cohort and how demographic information and CSO data about local areas should be part of the programme design. </p><p>My Department has initiated a detailed consultation process with the youth sector and providers of youth services about the review's findings and recommendations.  To date, consultations have taken place at regional meetings for youth services in Cork, Sligo and Dublin City and County.  Further consultations will take place over the summer months.  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the youth sector interests in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.</p><p>The Department is developing an implementation plan to progress the reforms over the period 2015 &ndash; 2016.  A project team has been set up in my Department  to oversee this work.  I intend that the reforms will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy which is nearing completion.</p></reply>

The work of the voluntary youth work sector, in the provision of these services, has a significant contribution to make to the Government&rsquo;s jobs agenda including the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  Many youth organisations are working closely with relevant Government Departments and delivering measures to implement the Youth Guarantee for young unemployed people.</p><p>My Department, in consultation with the youth sector, has developed a '<i>Youth Employability Initiative&rsquo;. </i>This builds on existing youth work initiatives that increase the employability of marginalised young people in the 15 to 24 age group.  My Department has compiled  a mapping report which has gathered information about the innovative youth work activities and programmes underway in the sector that contribute to youth employability objectives.  This new initiative will target the hardest to reach young people who are at risk of becoming NEET (i.e. not in employment, education or training) for intensive support.  My Department has secured &euro;600,000 via Dormant Accounts funding for the new initiative.  It will shortly commence discussions with the Education and Training Boards, youth officers and other youth sector stakeholders with a view to rolling out the initiative in 2015.  The overall objective is to increase young people&rsquo;s employability, enhance their acquisition of key competencies and transferable skills and aid their progression to employment, education or training.  Dedicated youth workers will be central to the coordination and management of the individual projects at local level.</p><p>My Department is developing a National Youth Strategy for 10 to 24 year olds.  It will be a universal strategy for all young people and will aim to be responsive to issues which impact on young people&rsquo;s lives, such as youth unemployment.  The Strategy will, inter alia, set out objectives that young people are equipped to participate in the labour market through opportunities to enhance employability skills and acquire attributes that complement formal learning and training qualifications.  It is anticipated that the Strategy will be available shortly.</p><p>My Department continues to work closely with the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth unemployment and the Youth Guarantee and in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations. </p>  <p>  Ensuring quality service delivery is an ongoing priority.  My Department is progressing and supporting the implementation of quality standards initiatives in the youth area.  This will help ensure an improvement in good practice, that these services and projects are outcomes focussed and that the young people involved are deriving the maximum benefit from being involved.  The National Quality Standards Framework for youth work applies to all staff-led youth work organisations, services, projects and programmes funded by the Department.  All youth work services and youth organisations funded by the Department are now applying these standards. </p>  <p>  A set of best practice standards for volunteer led youth clubs and groups, such as Scouting Ireland and the Irish Girl Guides and others was introduced by my Department in 2013.  The aim of these standards is to support 1,600 clubs with some 10,000 members in creating and providing quality programmes and activities for young people in safe and supportive environments.  The implementation of quality standards and the best practice guidelines is being supported by a Quality Standards Training and Resource Development Group, which involves experienced youth workers and other experts.  Its task is to develop the resource materials and training to support the voluntary providers of youth services throughout the country.  The introduction of the quality standards has been welcomed by the national youth organisations and local services.  My Department has plans to further develop the quality standards and the supports for the voluntary youth services to implement them in the context of the new National Youth Strategy, which will be available shortly.</p></reply>

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.  Pneumonia is common, but not always present.  Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported.  Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit.  Approximately 36% of reported patients with MERS-CoV have died.  The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, people with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes.</p><p>Although the majority of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections, camels are likely to be a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of MERS infection in humans.  However, the exact role of camels in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown.  Between April 2012 and 26 June 2015, globally, 1355 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 483 related deaths have been reported to WHO. </p><p>The is an ongoing outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea.  Up to 26 June, a total of 180 MERS-CoV cases, including thirty (30) deaths have been reported to WHO from South Korea and one case has been reported in China.  Although the MERS-CoV cluster in South Korea is the largest observed outside of the Arabian Peninsula, the cluster remains limited to patients, visitors to patients and healthcare workers in a few healthcare facilities, and close relatives of the cases who were visiting the health facilities where the cases where admitted.  The pattern noticed in Korean hospitals corresponds to what had been observed in Saudi Arabian hospitals, when extended transmission in hospital occurred following the admission of one case.  This resulted in &lsquo;super-spreader&rsquo; situations, amplified by the absence of triage in emergency rooms.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE acts as the focal point in Ireland  for receipt of international alerts on communicable disease from the World Health Organisation  under the International Health Regulations  and also as focal point for  early warning on emerging infectious disease threats in Europe as part of the European Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).  These systems are monitored 24/7 by HPSC.  In addition the European Centre for Disease control provides rapid risk assessments of emerging infectious threats including zoonotic diseases.  These risk assessments are  analysed and disseminated by HPSC as appropriate.</p><p>The HPSC has sent  three recent alerts  to clinicians in relation to MERS-CoV - on 2 June, 8 June and 17 June.  The main points to note for clinicians/public health at this time are:</p><p>1. Continued clinical vigilance and awareness of the possibility of MERS Co-V in patients presenting with severe acute respiratory infection who have recently been in contact with healthcare services in South Korea and also those who have returned from the Middle East (the index case in the South Korean outbreak had a history of travel to the Middle East prior to illness onset).  Note the possibility of atypical presentations in persons with immunosuppression.</p><p>2. The importance of eliciting a travel history from the aforementioned patients with severe respiratory disease cannot be overemphasised.</p><p>3. The prompt, systematic and strict implementation of infection prevention and control measures for such patients presenting in healthcare facilities is essential to interrupt transmission and to prevent health care-associated infections from MERS-CoV.See infection prevention and control guidance on HPSC website at .</p><p>Additional information and documents are available on the HPSC website.</p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of HPSC in 2005 established a Vector borne Subcommittee to monitor emerging threats posed by insect vectors.  This Subcommittee remains vigilant for vector borne disease and, most recently has published a Ranking of Likelihood of Emergence of Selected Vector borne Diseases in Ireland (available on the HPSC website).  This document and the work underpinning it, feeds into the ongoing threat assessment of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control into vectorborne diseases.</p><p>In addition the Department of Foreign Affairs has issued travel advice on its website for those travelling to Middle East and to South Korea.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is currently the subject of a Review. This review is considering the Scheme&rsquo;s long term sustainability as well as looking at how well the current model of provision is balancing residential care with care in the community, and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want. </p>  <p>  While there will always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of community-based services aimed at ensuring older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity, and as close to home as possible. Services are provided on a prioritised basis based on a care needs assessment and availability of resources.     </p>  <p>  In its National Service Plan (NSP) for 2015 the HSE stated that it will continue to progress the strategic realignment of services to provide home care and community support services in order to maximise the potential of older people in their own homes and communities.  The levels of home supports planned for in the NSP are: 10.3 million hours of home help service supporting 50,000 people - this is same level of service as 2014;13,800 people in receipt of a home care packages at any one time - this includes an additional 600 people supported under the delayed discharges initiative; 190 people in receipt of an intensive home care package at any one time - these packages were introduced for the first time in 2014 for people with more complex care needs.</p></reply>

These numbers are expected to increase to over 140,000 by 2041 as the number of older people in Ireland increases.</p>  <p>  The Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014. This delivers on a commitment in our Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementia's strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.  The Strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities for far longer than many people appreciate.</p>  <p>  The Strategy distinguishes between those Actions that can be progressed within existing resources and others to be addressed as more resources become available. An Office has been established within the HSE to lead the implementation of the Strategy.  The consolidation of functions that were previously dispersed will have a very significant effect in generating and maintaining momentum and driving change. </p>  <p>  A diagnosis of dementia is often accompanied by confusion and distress. Those affected and their families  don&rsquo;t know where to turn, and the very clear message from those affected by dementia was that clear information and guidance is critical. For this reason GPs are a key focus of the Strategy as they are very often the first port of call for people concerned about dementia. Work to deliver better information to GPs, both clinical and relating to relevant local services, is being lead by Dr. Tony Foley, who is himself a GP and was a member of the Group that advised on the Strategy's formal actions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to accelerate the implementation of significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017. This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m and Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia; the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia. The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.  Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme. This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. In addition, the Group includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.</p></reply>

The aim of this policy is to provide a consistent approach to protect persons at risk of abuse across, for example, older people and disability services.  This new policy is for all HSE and HSE-funded services, and builds upon and incorporates existing policies in this regard.  Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each Community Healthcare Organisation are being developed to implement this policy at operational level where concerns arise relating to vulnerable persons.</p><p><i>Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>now provides one overarching policy to which all agencies will subscribe and implement in their place of work ensuring:-</p><p>-  a consistent approach to protecting vulnerable people from abuse and neglect</p><p>-  all services have a publicly declared 'No Tolerance' approach to any form of abuse</p><p>-  a culture which supports that this ethos is promoted.</p><p>In light of the above, I have referred the Deputy's question to the HSE for direct reply, in relation to a more detailed response on the specific operational issues raised.</p></reply>

The vaccine is given to protect babies against Tuberculosis (TB). In Ireland the number of cases of TB has been falling and there were no cases in young children in 2014.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has a contract with a Danish supplier for the procurement of BCG vaccine. BCG vaccine must be specifically packed for distribution to each country. According to the contract when BCG vaccine arrives into Ireland it should have a shelf life of 6 months.  The contract contains a delivery schedule of an agreed amount of BCG vaccine every three months. The delivery volume is more than sufficient vaccine for newborn babies and others requiring BCG vaccination.   </p>  <p>  Since 2014 the supplier has been supplying BCG vaccine with significant delays due to issues in their production. The last shipment of BCG vaccine due to arrive at the end of October 2014 arrived at the end of December 2014. The delay in delivery meant that two months shelf life was lost and this expired at the end of April 2015. The HSE had sufficient BCG vaccine in Ireland until it expired at the end of April 2015. Had more stock been purchased it too would have expired at the end of April 2015.  </p>  <p>  In addition delivery of BCG vaccine produced in 2014 were suspended pending an extensive investigation regarding a possible problem with the capping of the vials. This investigation has now been concluded and product produced during 2014 is being released, but it will take some time to release all the batches produced. As a result this BCG vaccine will have very short remaining shelf life until newly produced product becomes available  </p>  <p>  In addition a number of qualification/validation activities have to be performed following repair of central equipment in the first half of 2015.  This means that production of new product will not commence until August 2015 and due to the lengthy analysis and release procedure, vaccine from this production will not become available until the end of 2015 or beginning of 2016.</p>  <p>  As a result there are limits to the quantities that can be ordered and delays on all deliveries. The supplier does not expect that the delivery situation will be normalised until 1 quarter of 2016 at the earliest.</p>  <p>  The HSE will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics when the BCG vaccine supply is restored. </p></reply>

The National Breastfeeding Strategy Implementation Committee have helped facilitate initiatives such as, evidence based breastfeeding policies implemented across the HSE; improvements in breastfeeding education and training; development of breastfeeding education resources;  development of guidelines on supporting and protecting breastfeeding in public places and the protection of breastfeeding through changes in maternity protection legislation and workplace initiatives.</p><p>Staff within HSE maternity and paediatric services and primary care are committed to the promotion, support and protection of breastfeeding. The HSE Infant Feeding Policy for Maternity and Neonatal Services is based on the <i>Baby Friendly 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding </i>and is the policy of all 19 maternity units. All 19 maternity units participate in the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and there are 8 designated Baby Friendly Hospitals. Breastfeeding is promoted to all expectant mothers in the antenatal period at maternity hospitals and in primary care. Mothers are offered support to breastfeed following birth. Care is provided by public health nurses in the community following discharge from maternity hospital and individualised care plans are developed for mothers. Over 200 breastfeeding support groups are provided by the HSE and HSE funded voluntary breastfeeding organisations around the country.</p><p>The HSE launched the first phase of its national breastfeeding campaign <i>&quot;Every Breastfeed Baby Makes a Difference</i>&quot; and promotes an annual National Breastfeeding Week.</p><p>The HSE website is the primary route for providing information, advice and support to women thinking about breastfeeding and those who are breastfeeding.</p><p>Feedback from year-round<i>search and display</i>advertising ensures that awareness of the campaign and the invitation to visit the website reaches the target audience.</p><p>HSE breastfeeding information materials including the booklet <i>&lsquo;Breastfeeding &ndash; a good start in life&rsquo;</i>was developed in partnership with Baby Friendly Hospitals Initiative, La Leche League, Association of Lactation Consultants, CUIDI&Uacute; and Friends of Breastfeeding. It forms part of the HSE Healthy Pregnancy Pack which is distributed widely through maternity hospitals and GPs and over 80,000 are distributed annually.  </p><p>A recent review of the Breastfeeding Strategic Action Plan  has highlighted supports being implemented.  These include policies to guide good practice and monitoring within HSE maternity services; enhancements in training for public health nurses and midwives; the expansion of appropriately trained community-led peer support programmes; the development of media messages to promote breastfeeding and the development of readily available information including the national breastfeeding website.</p><p>An Obesity Policy and Action Plan is currently being devised by my Department and issues including breastfeeding are being considered as part of this work.</p></reply>

Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the scheme.  Out of an approximate population of 1 million people under the age of 16 years, almost 450,000 held a medical card or a GP visit card and approximately 29,000 children qualified for the DCA payment in 2014.  It is estimated that about two-thirds of children qualifying for a DCA payment also hold a medical card.</p>  <p>  In addition, from 1 July 2015, all children under the age of 6 years are entitled to access a GP service free of charge, as part of the first phase of introducing a universal GP service in Ireland.  It has been estimated that the average expenditure per medical card was &euro;973 in 2013, however, it is not possible to provide the actual costs requested by the Deputy as it would depend on the variable nature of the individuals&rsquo; requirements as well as the number of individuals and the quantum and cost of health services that would be used.</p></reply>

Delays in processing nurse registration applications are directly connected to the volume of requests arising from the current initiatives to attract and retain nurses in the Irish health services.  The Department of Health and the HSE are collaborating in sourcing several solutions to meeting the issues arising in relation to nurse recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  The background to this issue is that nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  In assessing an applicant for registration, to protect the public, the NMBI seeks evidence from applicants of comparable standards of education and practice.  According to the NMBI the timeframe for the completion of the assessment of qualifications for registration takes up to a maximum of 90 days provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant.</p>  <p>  The main difficulty to expediting timely applications as reported by the NMBI is that of delay or failure by the applicant or third parties to furnish the necessary documentation required to assess eligibility for registration.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant to undertake a six to twelve week period of adaptation and assessment.  A period of adaptation is designed to make up for differences in education and ensure competence for working in the Irish health service.  If this adaptation is required it must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the NMBI are dealing with very significant volumes of applications at present.  The NMBI are processing all applications as quickly as possible, while ensuring appropriate procedures and checks which are designed around protection of the public.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that NMBI have been allocated additional resources to address the issues.</p></reply>

The National Dementia Strategy is a case in point. This Strategy was prepared in the light of advice from a Group which included State agencies, representative groups, researchers and medical professionals and a similar Group has been established to monitor the implementation of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  There is already a broad consensus on the direction that our approach to caring for older people should take, including the importance of allowing more older people to stay at home and in their own communities for as long as possible, the need to cater for people at the lowest appropriate level of complexity and the need to provide residential care when and if this is needed.</p>  <p>  The decisions that remain to be taken are therefore less about what we be need to do, but about how to do it.  This relates in a large part to resourcing and balancing of priorities within the health sector and within Government overall.  This is not an area that can be readily progressed by the kind of forum that is proposed by the Deputy.  Further, it would be inappropriate to delegate elements of public policy, possibly including budgetary policy, to any consultative forum, particularly where some of those represented may have a commercial vested interest in the outcome.</p></reply>

Currently the turnaround time for Passport Express is on average ten working days for renewal application and 12 working days for first time applicants or for those who have lost or had their passports stolen. However the Department emphasises, including on passport application forms and on our website, that these turnaround times are a guideline rather than a stated guarantee. For this reason we recommend that citizens apply at least six weeks in advance of any planned travel.</p>  <p>  Almost 50% of passport applications are received in the months April to July. To cope with the seasonal demand the passport service has recruited 160 additional temporary staff, most taken from the live register. This is in addition to the active pursuance of opportunities to improve customer service through a combination of internal and external service delivery initiatives. These measures have enabled the Passport Service to keep the average turnaround times for passport express at ten or 11 days for the entire peak period.</p></reply>

I addressed the NPT Review Conference in New York at its opening on 27 April this year in order to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s continuing strong commitment to nuclear disarmament. I also had the opportunity to meet with a number of delegations on that occasion.</p>  <p>  It is a matter of great regret that, despite strenuous efforts, including by Ireland, the 2015 NPT Review Conference ended without an agreed outcome document.  Both before and during the Conference, Ireland worked for concrete progress on creating an effective outcome document through our national efforts and also through the New Agenda Coalition (NAC), a cross-regional group of States, including Ireland, which are committed to promoting urgent progress on nuclear disarmament.  Right from the inception of the NPT, Ireland has emphasised - primarily for humanitarian reasons - the urgent need to pursue the effective measures for nuclear disarmament mandated by Article VI of the Treaty.  It is clear that, in order to be effective, these measures need to be legally binding, and it is my view that work on elaborating them needs to begin immediately.</p>  <p>  The need for urgent progress on nuclear disarmament has been given even greater impetus by the facts and research presented at three major recent conferences on the risks and consequences associated with nuclear weapons and the devastating humanitarian consequences of any nuclear detonation whether by accident or design.  A statement endorsed at the Review Conference by 159 States, including Ireland, asserts that nuclear weapons must never be used again under any circumstances and that the only way of ensuring this is through their total elimination.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s final statement to the Review Conference recalled our commitment to nuclear disarmament and our belief that effective measures for the implementation of Article VI are required as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  This has always been and remains Ireland&rsquo;s position, as was shown last year when Ireland was Coordinator of the New Agenda Coalition and contributed significantly to the debate at the Final Preparatory Committee meeting for the NPT Review Conference by presenting on behalf of the NAC a Working Paper with detailed proposals on the effective measures required by Article VI. This work was taken forward by the current NAC Coordinator, New Zealand, at the Review Conference itself. I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to work towards achieving a world without nuclear weapons, including by consulting closely with like-minded partners and by supporting South Africa, when it assumes the role of Coordinator of the New Agenda Coalition from 1 July 2015.</p></reply>

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. Some 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p>  <p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the current position is not available centrally within my Department.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.1159.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000085#WRU01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 512 to 522, inclusive, together.</p><p>  Up until September 2012, an ex-quota allocation was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools. This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p><p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the current position is not available centrally within my Department. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p><p>  I am aware of the surveys and research referred to by the Deputy.  In any survey or research it is important that it also reflects a school management perspective or encompass the role of other teachers in schools given that guidance provision is a whole school activity.</p><p>Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.</p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. </p><p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools. Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.</p><p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on &quot;wellbeing&quot; being studied by all pupils. </p><p>  I would also like to point out that I have repeatedly argued that improvements to the staffing and funding of our schools must be a priority as the economic recovery takes hold.  The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015. </p><p>I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future.</p></reply>

This is the highest number of SNAs that we have ever had and it has ensured that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs. This year, the NCSE requested all schools to submit applications for SNA support by mid March 2015.  Following this deadline each application had to be assessed by the NCSE before they were in a position to advise the Minister on the quantum of SNAs that would need to be allocated to schools for the coming school year.  The final advice on this was received last week, and the Minister will be seeking to confirm allocations to schools over the next ten days.</p><p>  The criteria whereby SNA allocations are made to schools by the NCSE is set out in my Departments Circular 30/2014.  This Circular makes clear that it is important that children with special educational needs are given an opportunity to develop independent living skills, and accordingly, as the care needs that children may have decline as they mature, SNA allocations may also reduce.  It should also be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  As this question relates to an allocation for an  individual child, I will arrange to have the matter referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.

The Apprenticeship system is employer led and the number of craft apprentices registered with SOLAS is determined by individual employers recruiting potential apprentices within a broad range of occupational sectors.</p><p>  At the end of 2014, apprentice registrations to the existing 27 trades were up 40% on the same point in 2013. The trend is continuing this year and the most recent apprenticeship forecasts anticipate that these growth trends will continue generally until 2018.  </p><p>  Education and Training Board Training Advisers visit schools and attend career fairs to promote this avenue of learning to students.  On a regular basis they visit schools and talk with young people on what is involved and the benefits of becoming a qualified craftsperson and they are also are available to meet with Career Guidance Counsellors.</p><p>  It should also be noted that as part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative in 2013, an independent group was established to carry out a review of the Irish Apprenticeship system to determine whether the current model should be retained, adapted or replaced. The subsequent report of the Review Group made a wide number of recommendations regarding the reform of existing apprenticeships and the extension of the apprenticeship model into new enterprise areas. An Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published in June 2014 in that regard.  </p><p>  A new industry-led Apprenticeship Council was appointed in November 2014 and is made up of a wide variety of stakeholders. In January 2015, the Apprenticeship Council formally invited proposals for new apprenticeship programmes from consortia of enterprise, professional bodies and education and training providers.</p><p>Over 80 separate proposals were received by the deadline. The proposals have been assessed by the Apprenticeship Council against a range of sustainability and deliverability criteria and recommendations are being submitted to me this week. It is expected that this process will result in a number of new apprenticeships becoming available, which will further enhance the opportunities available in this important area of work based learning.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p><p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. </p><p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. </p><p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. </p><p>  My focus in Budget 2015 was on obtaining the additional funding that was necessary to provide for demographic growth. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015. This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focused pre-school inspections. </p><p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

In order to manage the arrangements at national level and to do so in a manner that fits with the redeployment arrangements it is necessary for the the GAM/EAL allocation to each primary school to be based on a school's mainstream classroom posts for the 2014/15 school year. </p><p>  This new system is more up to date than the original GAM model which was not updated to reflect changes in enrolments for most schools in nearly a decade.</p><p>Circular 0005/2015 lists the GAM/EAL allocation for all schools. Where schools do not have sufficient GAM/EAL hours to create a full-time post, a process is in place for such schools to enter into cluster arrangements with neighbouring schools.

While a small number of these staff remain in schools, the schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and/or caretaking) services. Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained. Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established under the Towards 2016 Agreement involving my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of secretaries (and caretakers) employed using grant funding. However, it was not possible to progress the forum's agenda beyond the initial fact finding survey, due to the State's budgetary and financial position. The forum's recent priority has been to consider appropriate measures in relation to the rates of pay of school secretaries and caretakers in the event that a review of the Public Service Agreements recommended changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum. </p><p>  It was recently agreed that my Department would engage with the union side in relation to issues around school secretaries (and caretakers). If agreement cannot be reached, the parties have agreed to enter an arbitration process on their pay, to be conducted by the Labour Relations Commission.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, section 28 is the section of the Education Act 1998  that provides for parental complaints in schools. It expresses a desirability  of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school. </p><p>  I am not satisfied with the current provisions of Section 28. I plan to revise it and to provide in law for a Parent and Student Charter. Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of  a Charter. Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important.  If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision parents are more  likely to accept the fairness of decisions. </p><p>  A core objective of the Charter will be to shift away from reacting to problems only after they give rise to grievances. Instead the emphasis will be on improving the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools so that grievances do no arise at all or are resolved quickly and informally, and as a result having to resort to a formal grievance process  should be much reduced. </p><p>  I plan to have this change introduced during the passage of the Education  (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015.</p></reply>

This was applied to schools by a 5% reduction across the range of per capita grants. </p><p>  The multi annual school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, provided for a 6% overall reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools. The reduction was introduced on a phased basis and applied by a 2% reduction in 2012 and 2013 and a further reduction of 1% in 2014 and 2015. </p><p>  In total these measures have resulted in capitation and related funding to the primary and second level school sector being reduced by 11%.

Under this scheme schools can have a student assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution-oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p><p>NEPS psychologists also provide a range of advisory and training services to teachers supporting the educational, social and emotional development of pupils at a whole-school, class and individual level.  Additionally, NEPS psychologists process applications for all post-primary schools nationally on behalf of State Examinations Commission (SEC) for students with Specific Learning Disabilities for Reasonable Accommodations in the Leaving Certificate examination and provide support, upon request, to schools experiencing critical incidents.</p><p>NEPS Psychologists are allocated schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, type, DEIS status, gender mix, geographical spread and the presence of special unit and classes. </p><p>NEPS Psychologists hold planning meeting with their assigned schools at the commencement of each academic year to discuss and agree the schools' priority needs and their particular programme of service for the year and this will vary to a degree according to the order and complexity of those needs. Service delivery to schools, as described above may be, according to the dictates of staff maternity or sick leave for example, a mixture of NEPS staff support and SCPA.</p><p>Furthermore NEPS is regionally structured with 22 offices nationally serving the needs of schools in their respective catchment areas which can and do commonly cross county boundaries, staff in these offices may also aggregate service across a cluster of schools (for training programmes) and so it is unfeasible to disaggregate overall service in terms cost or time-input by school or county nor does NEPS attempt to do so.</p><p>I attach for the Deputy's information therefore, at Appendix A, an outlay by county of the cumulative school pupil coverage and aggregate workload assigned to NEPS psychologists based on the weighting process described above. </p><p>I also attach at Appendix B a breakdown of the psychologist staffing numbers for 2011 to 2015 (as of 1st January of each year) and the overall expenditure by NEPS in providing service for the same period. </p><p>My Department remains committed to the maintenance of the NEPS service to schools and I can inform the Deputy that current NEPS psychologist staffing numbers stand at 183 (172 w.t.e.), including 5 temporary posts, the highest level since the establishment of the Service in 1999.  Furthermore the process of engaging three additional psychologists is nearing completion.</p><p>APPENDIX A</p><p>Breakdown by County and Academic Year of Pupil and cumulative School Weighting Points

This year, the NCSE requested all schools to submit applications for SNA support by mid March 2015.  Following this deadline each application had to be assessed by the NCSE before they were in a position to advise the Minister on the quantum of SNAs that would need to be allocated to schools for the coming school year.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.1271.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000087#WRW02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 562 and 563 together.</p>  <p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the current position is not available centrally within my Department. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p>  <p>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.</p>  <p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p>  <p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools. Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on "wellbeing" being studied by all pupils.  I would also like to point out that I have repeatedly argued that improvements to the staffing and funding of our schools must be a priority as the economic recovery takes hold. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015. </p>  <p>  I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future.</p></reply>

The curriculum deals with issues such as making decisions, developing self confidence, growing and changing and personal safety.  For those schools that provide the Transition Year programme, they continue and expand on  their students education, including providing greater awareness of their wellbeing and of how to assist themselves and their peers.  Schools are encouraged to engage actively with community groups and a wide range of stakeholders to provide for extra curricular learning opportunities. Many schools invite organisations such as the Red Cross or the Order of Malta to provide some first aid training, or to give talks to students.</p>  <p>  Within Transition Year, which is taken by 50% of students, a flexible menu of learning modules can be provided by schools within the context of a framework for the programme set out by the Department of Education and Skills.  As part of this, it is open to schools to provide first aid training if they wish to do so.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also developed a template descriptor for Transition Units which can be used by organisations and agencies developing inputs for the programme.</p></reply>

The final advice on this was received last week, and the Minister will be seeking to confirm allocations to schools over the next ten days.</p>  <p>  The criteria whereby SNA allocations are made to schools by the NCSE is set out in my Departments Circular 30/2014.  This Circular makes clear that it is important that children with special educational needs are given an opportunity to develop independent living skills, and accordingly, as the care needs that children may have decline as they mature, SNA allocations may also reduce.  It should also be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  As this question relates to an allocation for an  individual child, I will arrange to have the matter referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date a total of &euro;81.77 million, including &euro;80.388m in contributions and &euro;1.382m in associated interest has been lodged to the special Investment Account managed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) for the Fund in accordance with section 29 of the Residential Institution Statutory Act, 2012. Responsibility for the management and investment of the funds available to Caranua rests with the NTMA in accordance with the 2012 Act.</p>  <p>  My Department has a Performance Delivery Agreement (PDA) with Caranua, which was updated in April 2015.  Caranua has undertaken to provide my Department with agreed monthly statistical information, quarterly financial information and quarterly reports on its achievement of its performance targets.  In relation to the monthly statistical reports, Caranua is currently reviewing its reporting systems and is expected to finalise the format of its monthly reports shortly.</p>  <p>  Caranua provides updates on its website (www.caranua.ie) in regard to the number of applications received and related matters. The most recent update shows that by end April 2015, Caranua had made payments of &euro;19.5m to 1,783 applicants.  Decisions made by Caranua can be appealed to the independent Appeals Officer appointed under section 21 of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act, 2012. I understand that to date a total of 74 appeals have been received by the Appeals Officer.</p>  <p>  The authorised staffing complement for Caranua is 10 posts, 7 of which posts are currently filled. In addition, Caranua is utilising the services of an employment agency to provide 14 temporary staff to assist in processing the backlog of applications. Caranua's 2013 Financial Statements covering the period 25th March to 31st December have recently been laid before each House of the Oireachtas. These show administration expenses for the period of &euro;0.388m.  I understand also that the provisional unaudited administrative costs associated with the running of Caranua in 2014 amounted to some &euro;1.2m. Finally, I would mention that Caranua has commissioned an external consultancy firm to review its structures, processes and systems.  I expect to receive a copy of this report and Caranua's views thereon in the near future. </p></reply>

SOLAS, with the assistance of relevant experts such as the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), employers and local and national organisations, have published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system. The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development. The Higher Education system is equally being transformed through structural change arising from the Higher Education strategy.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which is funded by my Department, advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy. It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met. The expert group's membership is broad and specifically includes representation from enterprise. Its research provides an input to the development of course curricula and informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, such as Momentum, Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme.</p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department has committed to review the National Skills Strategy. The review will provide an opportunity to determine the volume, type and mix of skills required to meet the Government's goal of full employment by 2018 and the challenges to be addressed to achieve this.</p>  <p>  Direct engagement between employers and education and training providers is also critical to ensuring that programmes are aligned to changing skills needs. As well as the actions that are being implemented across the education and training system as part of the Further Education and Training and Higher Education reform programmes to enhance links with enterprise and prepare learners for the different roles they will have over their working lives work is also underway in the context of the Skills Strategy review to develop the regional and national infrastructure for engagement between education providers, employers and other enterprise stakeholders, in communicating and addressing skills needs.</p></reply>

These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures. A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.</p>  <p>  The procedures outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.</p>  <p>  The procedures also recognise the importance of good supervision and monitoring systems to prevent bullying and facilitate early intervention. The school's anti-bullying policy must explicitly confirm that appropriate supervision and monitoring policies and practices are in place to both prevent and deal with bullying behaviour.</p>  <p>  In relation to reporting bullying behaviour, the procedures make clear that a pupil or parent may bring a bullying concern to any teacher in the school and individual teachers must take appropriate measures regarding reports of bullying behaviour in accordance with the school's anti-bullying policy. The procedures require that all reports, including anonymous reports of bullying, must be investigated and dealt with and that it should be made clear to all pupils that when they report incidents of bullying they are not considered to be telling tales but are behaving responsibly.  The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils. There is a requirement in the procedures for the school Principal to report regularly to the Board of Management in relation to the overall number of bullying cases and provide confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.</p>  <p>  The Board is also required, under the procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school. Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying. Furthermore, the Inspectorate's plan for 2015 provides for collaborative research to be conducted in a sample of primary and post primary schools on how schools provide for pupils' well-being. This will culminate in a research report which will highlight best practice.  This is also an issue that will need to be considered in the context of developing a Parent and Students Charter that each school will be obliged to have. An important aspect of the Charter will be how parents receive information and feedback on the operation of school policies and how parents concerns are addressed.</p></reply>

The NCSE allocated 6,454 resource teacher posts to schools for September 2015, which is an increase of 554 posts - or 9.4% - since September 2014. Details of resource teaching allocations to schools is available on the NCSE website on a county by county basis at www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  An additional 149 special classes will open in September which brings to over 1,000, the number of special classes in mainstream schools and represents a 17% increase over the 2014/15 number of special classes. Details of special class teachers and special school allocations for 2015/16 is available on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.  In addition, 11,330 SNA posts, an increase of 365 posts, or over 3%, are available to the NCSE to allocate to the end of 2015.  This is the highest level of special needs teachers and SNA support that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  Details of the number of SNA and Resource Teachers which have been allocated to each school are published on a per county basis on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of all of the SNA and Resource Teacher allocations which have been made to each school in County Kildare by the NCSE.  Details of the 2014/15 and 2015/16 school year Resource Teaching allocations have been published.</p>  <p>  This year, the NCSE requested all schools to submit applications for SNA support by mid March 2015. Following this deadline each application had to be assessed by the NCSE before they were in a position to advise the Minister on the quantum of SNAs that would need to be allocated to schools for the coming school year. The final advice on this was received last week, and the Minister will be seeking to confirm allocations to schools over the next ten days. Details of SNA allocations to schools for 2015/16 will be available on the NCSE website on completion of this process.</p></reply>

Outside of the schools sector, the list of demands includes funding of third level, investment in early years and investment in technology. It is not, and never will be, possible to satisfy all of the demands of the education system at one time.

These are schools that are more than 8 km distant from the next nearest school of the same type of patronage and language of instruction. The second measure is the development of a voluntary amalgamation protocol for the very smallest schools that have reducing enrolments and are located within an 8 km distance of a school of similar patronage and language of instruction.

Section 11(7) of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 gives the local authority discretion, after 5 days following the making of an entry in the register, to dispose of or destroy in a humane manner, stray dogs unclaimed by their owner having given notice to that owner or person in charge of the dog, if such owner or other person is known or can be readily ascertained.</p>  <p>  Details of all dogs seized by a dog warden of a local authority, and dogs detained by another person and notified to the dog warden, must be entered into the register maintained in accordance with section 14 of the Act as an aid to persons whose dogs have strayed or otherwise been lost.

The recommendations made regarding the register of electors include recommendations regarding the online registration of voters and on a rolling electoral register in place of the existing registration arrangements.  In law, the preparation of the register of electors is a matter for each local authority as a registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</p><p>While I have no immediate plans for reviewing the &lsquo;checktheregister.ie&rsquo; facility or for the introduction of an online or rolling register of electors in place of the existing registration arrangements, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an Electoral Commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and my Department.  On 27 January 2015 I published a consultation paper to commence the pre-legislative process leading to the establishment of an Electoral Commission. One of the issues identified for consideration in the consultation paper is the role that an Electoral Commission might play in respect of the register of electors.</p><p>The consultation paper is being considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht who are now engaged in a public consultation process in relation to the consultation paper. I understand that public hearings are to conclude before the end of July. A report is to be submitted to me on the outcomes from the consultation process as soon as possible thereafter and that will inform the development of an Electoral Commission Bill.</p><p>On the question of standardising practices by registration authorities in the performance of their registration duties, my Department issued guidance on preparing and maintaining the register of electors in May 2006 and will keep the need for further guidance under review. On the specific issue of deletion of existing names on the register, the Guidance advises that a name which appeared on a previous register should not be omitted solely on the grounds that the name is not included in the list of names furnished in respect of the household on the relevant form for the register being compiled. The Guidance advises that checks be carried out in such cases.</p></reply>

Close to one-third of households living in the sector are in receipt of housing support in the form of rent supplement or other State support and so the sector is of key importance for the provision of social housing also. This is recognised in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 goal to meet the needs of 75,000 households in the sector, primarily through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.</p>  <p>  With regard to the housing market, Construction 2020: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector sets out the Government&rsquo;s plans to address a number of issues being faced in the property and construction market and to address blockages in the system in order to get the market moving and increase supply. This includes facilitating the sustainable and professional development of the private rented sector.</p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been characterised by small-scale landlords. Attracting large-scale investment in professionally managed residential property, for example using Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and other options for long-term investment, can have an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard sector that tenants deserve.</p>  <p>  The acquisition and management of properties by professional REITs is part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector&rsquo;s interest and exposure.  For example, since its launch in April 2014, Irish Residential Properties REIT, the first Irish REIT with a primarily residential property investment focus, has built up a portfolio of high quality Dublin residential properties.  The sector is expected to continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  Following on from the commitment in Construction 2020 to develop a national policy towards professionalising the private rental sector, the Social Housing Strategy includes an action (Action 35) to continue work on the development of this policy with the aim of increasing investment in and supporting the supply of, good quality, secure and affordable rental accommodation. The timeline for this is the fourth quarter of 2015.</p>  <p>  The governance structure established to ensure that the actions in the Social Housing Strategy are overseen and delivered includes five workstreams or working groups, each with a specific focus. The development of the policy on the private rented sector is taking place in the context of Workstream 5 which includes officials from my Department and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform as well as representatives of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the National Economic and Social Council (NESC), the Housing Agency and the local authority sector.</p>  <p>  In the period since the publication of Construction 2020, a number of reports on the future of the private rented sector have been published. Notably these include two reports by DKM Economic Consultants commissioned by the PRTB and a series of reports from NESC including Social Housing at the Crossroads: Possibilities for Investment, Provision and Cost Rental and most recently, Ireland&rsquo;s Private Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply.</p>  <p>  The latter report calls for more secure occupancy for tenants, including greater rent certainty as well as measures to increase the supply of rental housing. The recommendations put forward in these reports will be considered carefully in the context of framing a national policy on the private rented sector. My overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) is also required before construction work commences and it may be illegal to operate a building without having a valid fire safety certificate in place where one is required.  In addition, section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act 1981 (as amended) imposes a duty on the persons in control of a premises to ensure the safety of persons on the premises in the event of a potential outbreak of fire.  Where the Fire Authority (in this case Dublin Fire Brigade) has concerns regarding the fire safety arrangements of a building, it may require the owner to carry out a fire safety assessment of the premises.</p>  <p>  I understand that following complaints regarding pyrite and possible related fire safety concerns in the development concerned, Dublin Fire Brigade wrote to the Management Company requesting a fire risk assessment in January 2013. A report by Fire Safety Consultants following a fire compliance inspection of the common means of escape from these apartments was subsequently received and identified a scope of remedial works to be undertaken including works relating to fire detection, emergency lighting and fire-stopping. The Fire Safety Consultants engaged on behalf of the Management Company have confirmed to Dublin Fire Brigade that the necessary remedial works have been completed.</p>  <p>  I understand that the report in question was commissioned by the Management Company and any question of its wider circulation is a matter for that company. The provisions of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 set out the means by which problems relating to the ownership and management of the common areas of both existing and new multi-unit developments can be addressed. The Act also aims to facilitate the fair and effective management of those bodies responsible for the management of such areas.  The Multi-Unit Development Act 2011 falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

In this context, the procurement of any goods and services is a matter for the individual contracting authorities.</p><p>Under (known as the Construction Products Regulation), manufacturers are required to provide robust and reliable information in a consistent way for construction products which are covered by harmonised European standards or European Technical Assessments. In broad terms, since 1 July 2013, manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance and affix the CE mark to each product being placed on the market.</p><p>For many construction products, the application of the CE mark will require the involvement of a third party (known as a &lsquo;notified body&rsquo;) to undertake certain tasks as specified in the harmonised European standard. These tasks may include activities such as initial type-testing of products, inspection of factory production control and surveillance of factory production control. In addition, the National Standards Authority of Ireland has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European standards in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.</p><p>As matters currently stand, there are a number of harmonised European standards, and accompanying Standard Recommendations, in place in respect of aggregates as well as for precast concrete products and masonry products which may require aggregates for their manufacture. In this regard, it is a matter for each individual contracting authority to specify their particular requirements for aggregates in their tender documents and to take such steps as are necessary to ensure that the aggregates provided meet their specifications and are suitable for the purpose for which they are intended.</p></reply>

The targeted social housing provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. The Strategy also includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the summary of social housing assessments by undertaking it on annual basis from 2016 onwards, which will support the continuous monitoring of social housing delivery against need. The Social Housing Strategy 2020 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:.</p><p>On 1 April 2015, I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,883 social housing units out to 2017.  On 5 May 2015, I announced funding of &euro;312 million for the first tranche of the local authority direct-build social housing programme under the Strategy. This announcement covers some 100 separate housing projects, providing 1,700 units across all 31 local authorities, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>Further announcements of new unit delivery under the Capital Assistance Scheme and the broader social housing investment programmes will be made in the coming weeks and months. </p><p>In addition, on 28<sup></sup>May 2015 I announced over &euro;91 million worth of housing investment to be used across a range of housing schemes to make more social housing available through returning vacant units back to use and to improve housing for people with disabilities, as well as retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency. </p><p>With regard to rising rents, a shortage of supply is at the heart of the issue and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. Construction 2020 also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development. </p><p>A key action for my Department under Construction 2020 is the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 which was published earlier this month. The Bill focuses on housing supply-related issues with a view to facilitating increased activity in the housing construction sector, particularly in the Dublin area where the housing supply shortage is particularly acute. It provides for changes in development contributions and in relation to the provision of housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. In addition, the Bill provides for the introduction of a vacant site levy. </p><p>The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report Ireland&rsquo;s Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply, which was published last month, is a welcome and timely contribution to the debate around the rental sector. The report calls for more secure occupancy for tenants, including greater rent certainty as well as measures to increase the supply of rental housing. The recommendations put forward in this report will be considered carefully in the context of framing any measures in relation to the rental market. My overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  In circumstances where a receiver is appointed to a landlord's interest in a dwelling it is essential that the rights of tenants are protected.  While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the policies and procedures of banks in appointing receivers cannot affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants.  The tenant continues to enjoy the same security of tenure.  The appointment of a receiver does not mean that a tenant loses their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</p>  <p>  The Act sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy.  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 112 days are provided for under the Act. Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, or where the tenant does not comply with the notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board for resolution.</p>  <p>  In documentation submitted prior to recent meetings with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank confirmed that they adhere to the legislative framework when dealing with the repossession of buy-to-let properties.</p>  <p>  The PRTB is aware of the impact on tenants of receivership and repossession proceedings.  The Board is engaging with the Central Bank and the financial institutions with a view to developing a voluntary code of practice to apply in such situations.  The main purpose of the code would be to ensure that the financial institutions are fully aware of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act and to ensure that there is consistency and fairness in the treatment of tenants in these cases. </p></reply>

As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital: research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths. The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.</p><p>In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remained fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels. The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones.</p><p>Peat briquettes are not covered by the solid fuel smoke emission standard set in national regulations since 1990, which are primarily concerned with bituminous (&lsquo;smoky&rsquo;) coal and products containing bituminous coal. </p><p>Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, a study has been commissioned to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. The study includes-</p><p>- an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels;</p><p>-  consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy;</p><p>-  an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching;</p><p>- assessment of the health impact of air pollution in general and specifically from residential solid fuel emissions;</p><p>- evaluation of smoke control legislation and enforcement; and</p><p>- consideration of the issue of fuel poverty. </p><p>A final report is expected to be presented to the North South Ministerial Council later this year. It should be noted that no decision has been made at this point regarding any extension of the &lsquo;smoky coal&rsquo; ban to other products.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.1423.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000089#WRY04500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616 to 618, inclusive, together.  </p><p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, provides the legislative basis for the Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) Charge. The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. </p><p>A residential property that was not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and have been living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner was no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it was the only residential property that person owned. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.</p><p>The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum. Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who failed to pay the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid. </p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013. In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen; the legislation does not provide for further penalties to apply after this date.</p><p>The NPPR Project Board, in conjunction with individual local authorities, undertook a media campaign in 2014 aimed at reminding non-compliant owners that additional late payment penalties applied after 31 August 2014. The extensive radio and print media campaign reminded non-compliant owners of their obligations to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period. While it is a necessary principle of law that all citizens are required to be aware of relevant legal obligations and duties in respect of such charges, as is the case in other jurisdictions, it remains my view that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that property owners have been aware of the Charge and liability dates. </p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at, encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner. It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment. The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. All non-compliant owners should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make their outstanding payments.</p></reply>

Many of the developments in question have not yet been taken in charge by the relevant local authority because they are unfinished.  In some cases the developments may be completed but not to the standards required under the planning permissions granted. My Department is engaged on a pilot project focusing on the situation in a number of local authority areas in order to get a clear overview of the nature of the problems which exist in the developments in question, and identifying possible solutions and the costs of alleviating those problems.  The information garnered from the pilot project will be used by my Department to inform the development of a co-ordinated approach to the taking-in charge by local authorities of developments with developer provided water services infrastructure and, where appropriate, the transfer of such infrastructure to Irish Water.  The participating local authorities have provided information regarding developments with developer-provided waste water treatment plans in their functional areas.  This information is currently being analysed, with consideration being given to the various remediation options available, depending on the location and size of the development and the nature and condition of the treatment system in place. </p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.</p><p>Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October 2014.  Subsequently, on 18 December 2014, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.</p><p>The second phase of the HAP statutory pilot has recently commenced with the HAP scheme becoming operational in Donegal County Council on 25 May 2015, in Offaly County Council on the 15 June, 2015 and in Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils and Cork City Council on 29 June 2015.  Consideration is currently being given to the introduction of HAP to further local authorities on an incremental basis later this year.  As the scheme is still in a pilot phase and is being rolled out incrementally, specific targets have not been set for each local authority area.  However the provision of HAP in these additional local authorities will assist in achieving the 2015 HAP delivery target of 8, 400 households supported by the scheme, as set out in the Strategy. </p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>sets ambitious targets for the rollout of HAP across all local authorities.  Specifically, the Strategy requires that all eligible households that require HAP will transition to the new scheme between 2014 and 2020.  As such, all other local authorities will be included in further phases of the rollout of HAP.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Bill, the levy will be charged on the registered owners of vacant sites at a rate of 3% of the market value of each site, with reduced or zero rates applying in specific circumstances. </p><p>The Bill contains an amendment to section 23 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 to provide that derelict site levy shall not be payable in respect of any land of which the vacant site levy is payable under the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill, when enacted.  This provision is intended to ensure that no double levy situation arises in the case of any individual site in respect of which the vacant site levy is being applied by a planning authority. </p><p>The Bill provides that planning authorities shall commence charging the vacant site levy from 1 January 2019 in respect of vacant sites entered on the vacant site register on 1 January 2018 i.e. it is charged in arrears.  The deferral until 2019 of the commencement of charging the levy is intended to allow site owners sufficient time and opportunity to obtain planning permission and initiate development or alternatively sell their sites in order to avoid becoming liable to the levy.  This ultimately facilitates the achievement of the primary objective of the measure which is to bring these sites forward for residential or regeneration development.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-30a.1474.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015063000090#WRZ03000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 640 to 642, inclusive, together.  </p><p>In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes in their areas.  My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding. </p><p>In 2014, local authorities adopted the fourth round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes in 2014, with the five-year rolling accommodation programmes running from 2014 to 2018.  These programmes provide a road map for local authority investment priorities over the period.  They also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for traveller accommodation, on foot of proposals received from local authorities and subject to approval from my Department.</p><p>2015 capital allocations in respect of traveller specific accommodation have issued to local authorities.  The bulk of the funding was allocated in respect of schemes already under construction, new schemes approved to commence construction in 2015 and to meet final balances on completed schemes.  The balance of funding is towards projects that will be newly approved during 2015. Details of the 2015 allocations are available on my Department's website at the following link:.  As funding is subject to the Annual Estimates process, there are no forward annual allocations.</p><p>The implementation of the traveller accommodation programme of each local authority, including the drawdown of funds is, in accordance with the above-mentioned Act, a matter for the authorities themselves.  Local authorities are requested to submit quarterly profiles of expenditure to my Department and these are closely monitored against actual expenditure.  If, during the year, a difficulty is identified in drawing down the funding allocated for a particular scheme, it will then be allocated to another scheme.</p><p>As regards the average cost of a unit of traveller specific accommodation, unit costs vary significantly due to the nature of traveller specific accommodation, as well as the differing needs of families.  In the case of permanent halting sites, costs can vary due to the difference in site costs and other additional works required as part of the development of the site, including accommodating the families off-site during the construction phase.  In the case of a house in a group scheme, it is difficult to determine an average cost as the size of the unit provided can vary across and within schemes.  Also, other factors can impact on costs, such as difficulty in obtaining suitable sites close to services and amenities.  All of these variables have a bearing on unit costs and proposals are assessed by my Department on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

Inputs from the wider Cork energy community into the Energy Green Paper process coordinated by my Department have been significant and were noted.  My Department has a strong interest in the energy sector in the Cork harbour area. For instance, the Beaufort Building on the IMERC campus, which is a state-of-the-art ocean research facility, is co-funded by my Department and I am represented on the oversight board of the IERC. </p>  <p>  Initiatives such as IMERC and IERC will ensure that the energy sector continues to help secure our return to economic growth and quality job creation. Both IMERC and IERC have a particular focus on research and collaboration with industry, a focus that is helping to develop a secure, affordable and sustainable energy future for Ireland. Earlier this year, I spoke at the annual IERC conference in Cork and I have also recently visited the IMERC centre where I saw first-hand how small and medium-sized research centres and enterprises are working to position Ireland as a focal point in the international marine renewable sector.</p>  <p>  Under the framework of the Government&rsquo;s Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, the IMERC facility, along with the quarter scale marine test facilities in Galway bay and the development of the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) off the coast of Mayo, combined with the support of the Prototype Development Fund managed by the Ocean Energy Unit of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), positions Ireland well to harness the potential of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources (wind, wave and tidal).</p>  <p>  The availability of Irish ports such as Cork, with the infrastructural capacity to support offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, is important if we are to realise the economic potential of the Irish offshore. The specific location in the Irish offshore of oil and gas exploration or development activity will undoubtedly be a key determinant in the commercial decision by industry as to which Irish port might be utilised in supporting such activity.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Cork Harbour area, together with many other locations, will play an increasingly important role in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future.</p></reply>

Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. The map identifies detailed information on over 50,000 townlands on a county-by-county basis and can be accessed at . The map shows Ireland with two colours BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services of a least 30Mbps. The AMBER area shows the target areas for the State intervention and includes over 700,000 addresses.</p><p>New private planned high speed broadband investments, such as those recently announced by eircom, may be added to the national high-speed coverage map, once it is established that these plans are definitive and meet the relevant criteria to deliver high speed broadband service to end users. My Department will thoroughly examine and evaluate any commercial investment announcements prior to altering the current national coverage map. For the moment, and pending finalisation of the necessary evaluation of eircom's announcement, the intervention area on our map will remain unchanged.</p></reply>

The required savings must be delivered in the non-domestic, domestic and energy poverty sectors in a 75-20-5 ratio respectively. Subject to their compliance with the terms and conditions for the scheme, as set out by the SEAI, it is a matter for indvidual energy suppliers, working with their customers, as to how they achieve the required energy savings.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p>  <p>  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p>  <p>  The publicly-funded intervention under the NBP will address those parts of the country not included by commercial operators' investment plans. The Plan envisages dealing conclusively with the rural connectivity issues so that current and future generations will have a guaranteed access to high quality, high speed broadband.

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility, is essential to Irish consumers.</p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Currently, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 2,700 MW approx. of which just under 2,400 MW is wind. EirGrid have forecasted in their &ldquo;All-island Generation Capacity Statement 2015-2024&rdquo; that between 3,200 and 3,800 MW of wind generating capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity.</p>  <p>  Ireland will also be required to meet targets for electricity generated from renewable sources in 2030. At the October 2014 meeting of the European Council, agreement was reached on the headline targets for the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, requiring a reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions of 40%, an increase in EU energy from renewable sources to 27%, and an indicative target of 27% energy efficiency in the EU. Ireland will be required to make a contribution to the achievement of these targets which will require additional electricity generated from renewable sources. Every effort is being made to ensure that Ireland's 2030 target will be technically feasible, cost effective and fair in terms of burden sharing across EU Member States.</p></reply>

I agree with this and the Harbour Company have acknowledged this also and confirmed that it will not happen again.  On the matter of Board discussions, I have referred the question to the Harbour Company for their direct response as I have previously done with the Deputy's earlier questions on this matter.   </p>  <p>  Under the then 2006 Guidelines on Contracts, Remuneration and Other Conditions of CEOs of Commercial State Bodies the published annual report and accounts of the body must disclose the CEO's annual basic salary, the actual payments made to the CEO under the performance related pay schemes and the all in cost of the CEO's total remuneration package (including superannuation provision, company car and any other benefits). I understand that the matter of the word "other" in the Notes to the Company's Financial Statements  relates to the payment of a car allowance to the CEO. This differs from the previous CEO who chose to avail of an expensed company car which attracted a benefit in kind charge.  The current CEO avails of a car allowance which is paid through the computerised payroll system and therefore PAYE and PRSI is deducted and is not subject to BIK.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Irish International Diaspora Centre trust and corporate governance issues, my predecessor wrote to the Company to highlight his concerns at the approach adopted and raised the issue of Ministerial consent in respect of the Diaspora project.  The Company has informed me that the Centre is being wound up.</p>  <p>  I do not know the basis for the Deputy's reference to a 10% reduction. There was no direction from the Minister for Finance or from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to cut the salaries of existing CEOs by 10%.  There was a review in 2011 of CEO salaries in Commercial State Bodies but it did not alter the contractual arrangements of incumbent CEOs.</p>  <p>  Again I will forward the Deputy's questions to the Harbour Company for direct reply on the aspects which are not covered in this reply.  If you do not receive a response within ten working days please contact my private office. </p></reply>

The criteria essential for recognition of licences from other countries are testing and licensing regimes which meet the requirement of the EU directive on driver licences.  On this basis Ireland recognises licences from, and has mutual recognition and exchange of licence arrangements with, other EU Member States and a number of other jurisdictions where research and discussion has shown that standards in those jurisdictions match those here.  Brazil is not one of those countries with which Ireland has mutual recognition of licences.</p>  <p>  In the absence of an exchange agreement, persons taking up residence in Ireland, who hold a Brazilian driving licence and who wish to obtain an Irish licence, must go through the normal procedures for obtaining a driving licence by passing the theory test, obtaining a learner permit and sitting the driving test.  While this may seem demanding in cases where people have a safe driving record in another jurisdiction, the overriding policy concern behind these regulations is that people are properly qualified to drive on our roads.  The six months waiting rule before sitting a driving test does not apply to applicants who come to Ireland with a full in date licence from their own country.</p></reply>

The Regulation included a partial derogation to be reviewed every five years, with the first period lasting until 31 December 2011. Following a review, the partial derogation was extended for a second period until 31 December 2016 under Regulation 1257/2010. Under the terms of the derogation in place since 2007, only legislation adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure (formerly the co-decision procedure) must be translated into Irish.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve the required timelines, a decision is required by Government in 2015 on the optimal approach to the derogation, following which the Council of the European Union will review its operation. A unanimous decision by Council is required before the end of 2015 on whether to extend, amend or end the derogation. The action agreed by Council would then be implemented from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of An Taoiseach have been actively engaging with the EU institutions and other relevant stakeholders for some time in order to formulate the optimal approach to the derogation. In this context, the legislative and non-legislative services, which are currently provided through Irish, and the potential to expand these services, are under consideration. Preparatory work on a draft Regulation has been underway in advance of the matter being brought to Government.</p>  <p>  In logistical and reputational terms, it is important to note that the approach adopted by Ireland in relation to the derogation is seen to be a balanced and rational response that will have regard to prevailing circumstances and challenges, particularly in relation to issues such as the timely recruitment of the requisite personnel and the actual usage of Irish in the EU institutions.</p></reply>

My Department is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Strategy in conjunction with a wide range of key stakeholders. The Deputy may be interested in the latest progress reports on its implementation, which were published last year by the relevant Departments, 12 in total, including my own Department. These reports are available at:  .</p><p>My Department administers a range of Irish Language and Gaeltacht Support Schemes. In addition, Foras na Gaeilge is responsible for the promotion of the Irish language throughout the island of Ireland, while &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta provides support for the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>The Gaeltacht Act 2012, which forms a key part of the Strategy, provides the legislative framework for the systematic implementation of the language planning process under the Act. My Department is implementing this process in conjunction with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge. Insofar as the Gaeltacht is concerned, 13 of the 26 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas have begun the language planning process. It is intended to continue the roll-out of the process in respect of the remaining 13 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>Following a public consultation process, I published a list of towns which may be designated as Gaeltacht Service Towns in December 2014, with priority being given to Galway City, Letterkenny and Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is. In the case of the Irish Language Networks, Foras na Gaeilge has sought expressions of interest from organisations in areas which may be designated as Irish Language Networks.</p></reply>

This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.  46 natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 natural heritage areas) are scheduled for de-designation. One of these sites is that referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question. </p><p>Regulatory change will be required to give full effect to the de-designation of the sites.
