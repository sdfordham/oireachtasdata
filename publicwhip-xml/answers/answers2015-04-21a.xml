The next Periodic Review of Iran is likely to take place in April 2019.  Our approach in each Periodic Review is determined by the situation prevailing at the time, including the extent to which recommendations accepted during previous reviews have been implemented.   </p>  <p>  Ireland intervened in the October 2014 review of Iran, expressing concern and making recommendations about the situation of some religious minorities and the use of the death penalty in Iran.  I regret that Iran accepted neither of the two recommendations we made. </p>  <p>  We have real concerns about the significant persecution which some groups, including those of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; faith, are subject to in Iran.  The UPR is not the only forum in which these concerns are expressed. </p>  <p>  During my address to the Human Rights Council on 4 March, I stated that "freedom of Religion and Belief is in peril in many places worldwide, with members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Bah&aacute;'&iacute; faith, disproportionately affected by violence, discrimination, and harassment." Ireland also recently raised the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; with the Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran, and the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, and directly with the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister on a visit to Dublin.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the Irish Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with the EU, will continue to encourage progress in relation to human rights issues in Iran, including the plight of some religious minorities, and to express our concerns to Iranian authorities at every appropriate opportunity.  </p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the US, we continue to work closely with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  All of this work is aimed at achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  Throughout his recent visit to the US and in a series of high level contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and at State level, the Taoiseach raised the issue of immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish, stressing that almost every family in Ireland is related to or knows somebody who is caught up in this deeply distressing situation.</p><p>During his meeting with President Obama on 17 March the Taoiseach commended him on his executive action announced late last year.  The Deputy would be aware that this action is currently the subject of legal proceedings in the US federal courts.  The Taoiseach emphasised the need to allow the undocumented to come out of the shadows and be free to travel home for family events.  He also highlighted the issue of those amongst the Irish undocumented who might be eligible for<b></b>visas, but who would be required to return to Ireland for their issuance and hence would require waivers for their prior period of undocumented residence.  </p><p>The Taoiseach also pointed to the need for a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US for those who wish to make a contribution there, expressing the hope that a political way forward could be found on this issue which would encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.  President Obama spoke of his executive actions on immigration reform and acknowledged the contribution of Irish immigrants to America&rsquo;s development. He considered that one of the great strengths of the United States had always been its willingness to welcome new immigrants to its shores.</p><p>I also raised immigration reform issues, including the possibility of immigration reform legislation and the question of visa waivers, when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also had the opportunity to discuss these matters on a number of occasions with US Ambassador O&rsquo;Malley. </p><p>In addition, the Taoiseach discussed immigration issues with Congressman Paul Ryan during his recent visit to Dublin on 30<sup></sup>March. </p><p>The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and with the US Embassy in Ireland. </p></reply>

At this meeting, I participated in a discussion of the deepening crisis in Yemen and how the EU can respond with my fellow Ministers and with High Representative Mogherini. We adopted conclusions which set out the EU position. As you mention Deputy, in recent weeks, a coalition of states led by Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes in response to advances by Houthi forces and following an invitation from President Hadi.   Last week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for all parties to scrupulously respect international human rights and international humanitarian law during the conduct of hostilities. I hope that all parties involved in the conflict in Yemen answer this call. </p>  <p>  Ireland does not have representation in Yemen, although our Embassy in Riyadh is carefully monitoring the crisis. Bearing this in mind, our ability to comment in detail on a fluid situation on the ground is constrained.  </p>  <p>  My view is nonetheless that peace talks are the optimum way to achieve a political consensus which can restore order to Yemen and avoid a protracted and sectarian conflict with implications for the future of Yemen and for the stability of the region. I would encourage all parties to engage with the UN to this end, so that a ceasefire can be agreed and a negotiated political solution found. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-21a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042100054#WRB00500"><p>The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period is a cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to promote trade, tourism, investment, education, innovation and culture to an overseas audience. Over the 2015 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and a further twenty-seven Ministers and Ministers of State undertook extensive programmes of engagements in a total of 27 different countries, supported by the Embassy network.  Of the 29 separate itineraries for Ministerial office-holders, 25 were in markets identified as &ldquo;Priority&rdquo; or &ldquo;Exploratory and High Potential&rdquo; under the 2014 Review of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. The choice of locations also reflected the recent expansion of the Embassy network, diaspora hubs, and Ireland&rsquo;s work in development cooperation.  The locations included the main centres of global business media coverage, which are critical to conveying Ireland&rsquo;s message of economic recovery.  As in previous years, North America was a particular focus of the visits, reflecting strong diaspora and trade and investment links.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade leads on the coordination of the Ministerial itineraries, and each year coordinates a set of key economic and related messages for dissemination at events overseas. The Embassy network is responsible for management of individual programmes on the ground, working closely with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. As such, Ministerial itineraries are designed to further our national objectives overseas in a highly co-ordinated, visible and effective way.   The value of Ministerial visits is incontrovertible, allowing us to leverage the unique opportunities provided by the international profile of our national day, which is unrivalled by any other country in the world.  The presence of a Ministerial office-holder from Ireland helps to secure bilateral meetings at the highest levels of Government to discuss issues of mutual concern; helps to secure attendance by senior executives of foreign companies at trade and investment-related meetings and events; helps to secure coverage of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by global and local media organisations; and helps to promote Ireland as a destination for tourism and international education.</p>  <p>  As regards the &euro;5 million figure for 2014, this figure comes from the &ldquo;Supporting Irish Exporters Section&rdquo; of the report &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Economic Diplomacy in Action: St Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2014&rdquo;, published by the Department in April 2014.  This report was compiled on the basis of reporting by the Embassy network, in consultation with the promotional State agencies, and the figure represented an estimate of new business won in the immediate aftermath of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period. My Department is currently compiling a report on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2015, and this will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made to ensure that costs related to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day itineraries are kept to a minimum. In 2014, the total cost of all Ministerial travel was &euro;281,739.  Again in 2015, clear instructions were issued for all Ministerial visits to be undertaken in the most cost-efficient way.  The full final cost is not yet available.</p></reply>

As part of that assistance, Embassy officials pay regular consular visits to this person at Al Wathba Central jail in Abu Dhabi.

Following each visit, the Embassy official met with senior prison officers to raise and discuss with them, any issues of concern reported by the Irish citizen.</p>  <p>  Additional support from the Embassy has been extensive and has included securing permission for a friend to visit the person named and facilitating the transfer of funds from the person&rsquo;s family to their prison account. </p>  <p>  The passport of the person named by the Deputy is in the possession of the Emirati authorities, as would be the normal practice for any foreign citizen detained in that country.

Firstly to see this individual released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland, and secondly to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by me and my officials in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests.It is important to bear in mind the role of the Irish Government where citizens are imprisoned abroad. Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  The decision to release this individual either on bail or on any other basis, will be a decision that is made solely by the Egyptian authorities.</p><p>Since this citizen was originally detained in August 2013, I, and officials in my Department including our Embassy in Cairo, have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities regularly and consistently.  In addition, he has received consular visits from Embassy official on 37 occasions.  I can confirm that the Irish Government has formally supported both the application by this citizen&rsquo;s lawyers for his release and return to Ireland under the November Presidential decree, and the more recent application for his release on bail.  Our official support for this citizen&rsquo;s release has been duly communicated to the Egyptian authorities in formal diplomatic notes that have been included in the documentation submitted to the court and the authorities by his lawyer.</p><p>I have spoken to my Egyptian counterpart on numerous occasions, both in person and on the telephone.  On 4 March I met with Assistant Foreign Minister Hisham Badr and discussed the case with him in some detail.  <i>On 2 April I spoke again with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Shoukry to underline the Government&rsquo;s support for the formal applications that have been made for this individual&rsquo;s release &ndash; both for the formal application for bail, and for the application that has been made for release under the Presidential decree on foreign prisoners.  I also took the opportunity to highlight key humanitarian concerns &ndash; including this individual&rsquo;s youth, his absence from his studies and the length of time in detention without conviction.</i></p><p>The individual&rsquo;s trial has started, with the next hearing scheduled for 26 April.  All of the information we have received indicates that it is highly unlikely that there will be any decision as regards his release until the court makes its decisions.  We continue to review our approach and actions in this case, but we are guided at all times by the two key objectives set out above.  Given that the trial has now commenced and a formal petition for his release on bail is currently being considered by the Egyptian courts, my Department must exercise restraint in its public comment.  This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases, in line with our clear objectives in this case and what we firmly believe to be in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests and to be most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him.</p><p>We remain in ongoing contact with this individual and his family, and will continue to offer full consular support.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond. All of this work is aimed at achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  Throughout his recent visit to the US and in a series of high level contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and at State level, the Taoiseach raised the issue of immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish, stressing that almost every family in Ireland is related to or knows somebody who is caught up in this deeply distressing situation.  </p><p>During his meeting with President Obama on 17 March the Taoiseach commended him on his executive action announced late last year. The Deputy would be aware that this action is currently the subject of legal proceedings in the US federal courts.  The Taoiseach emphasised the need to allow the undocumented to come out of the shadows and be free to travel home for family events. He also highlighted the issue of those amongst the Irish undocumented who might be eligible for<b></b>visas, but who would be required to return to Ireland for their issuance and hence would require waivers for their prior period of undocumented residence.  The Taoiseach also pointed to the need for a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US for those who wish to make a contribution there, expressing the hope that a political way forward could be found on this issue which would encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress. President Obama spoke of his executive actions on immigration reform and acknowledged the contribution of Irish immigrants to America&rsquo;s development. He considered that one of the great strengths of the United States had always been its willingness to welcome new immigrants to its shores.</p><p>I also raised immigration reform issues, including the possibility of immigration reform legislation and the question of visa waivers, when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also had the opportunity to discuss these matters on a number of occasions with US Ambassador O&rsquo;Malley.  In addition, the Taoiseach discussed immigration issues with Congressman Paul Ryan during his recent visit to Dublin on 30<sup></sup>March. </p><p>The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and with the US Embassy in Ireland. </p></reply>

In recent months the primary focus of our discussions has been on the effective and expeditious implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  However, we have also discussed a range of other areas of mutual interest including specific legacy cases.  In terms of our discussions on the Stormont House Agreement, both Governments remain committed to playing their parts in ensuring the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  In that context, the Secretary of State and I have discussed the need to ensure that recent developments in regard to the Welfare Bill in Northern Ireland do not have a corrosive impact on the wider implementation of the Agreement.  In accordance with the review and monitoring provisions of the Stormont House Agreement, quarterly review meetings are held involving the Northern Ireland Executive party leaders and the British and Irish Governments.  I attended the second such meeting in Belfast on 27 March.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland also attended.  The meeting reviewed progress made to date on the detailed implementation timeline for the Stormont House Agreement, which was agreed by the NI Executive party leaders and the two Governments at our first review meeting on 30 January.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Government was not a party to the negotiations late last year in Stormont Castle or Stormont House which dealt specifically with budgets and financial issues.  Recent and ongoing discussions on these matters take place primarily between the NI Executive Party Leaders themselves.  For that reason, I have called on the Northern Ireland parties, and in particular Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, to work together to find a solution to the current difficulties on welfare.  I know that work is ongoing by Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political leaders to resolve the welfare issue, and I understand that some progress has been made. </p></reply>

This is clearly articulated in 'The Global Island- Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World' which was launched in January by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In our policy on International Development, 'One World, One Future', we have clearly reaffirmed our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), and to making further progress towards it when economic circumstances permit.  In the face of severe economic difficulty, our aim has been to protect allocations to the aid programme, in so far as this has been possible.  The Government has successfully managed to stabilise allocations to the programme.  This is a major achievement, in extremely difficult circumstances.  For 2015, we have again protected overall allocations to the aid programme, and provided a total of just over &euro;600 million for ODA. </p>  <p>  As our economic recovery continues to consolidate and strengthen, the challenge now is to determine how best we can make sustainable progress towards the UN target, as we continue to build on Ireland&rsquo;s world-class aid programme by ensuring we make an effective contribution to the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger.  I will be making the strongest possible case for an increase in the budget for the aid programme in 2016. </p></reply>

The establishment of the position of Minister for Diaspora Affairs is a tangible demonstration of the Irish Government&rsquo;s deep commitment to the Irish community abroad.  On 3 March the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Minister Deenihan and I launched &lsquo;Global Irish: Ireland&rsquo;s Diaspora Policy&rsquo; the first ever Policy on the Irish diaspora.

They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls, and a direct threat to education and education facilities.  The abduction just over a year ago of more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok appalled the world.  It has been only one of a number of attacks on defenceless young people, and it still requires an adequate response.  I once again urge the Government of Nigeria to commit the necessary resources to finding the girls and returning them to their families and their education.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently condemned the acts of violence being perpetrated by Boko Haram.  Most recently, at a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 1 April, we highlighted in particular the terrible human rights and humanitarian impact of the terrorist violence.  The extent of the humanitarian crisis has also been emphasised by EU Foreign Affairs Ministers, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on 9 February.  The EU has pledged to continue providing immediate relief to those in need and to increase our efforts at regional level.  Ireland has recently provided some &euro;1 million in humanitarian stocks to the NGO, Plan, for Nigerian refugees fleeing Boko Haram who are living in camps in northern Cameroon.  The recent military success in pushing Boko Haram back from major towns in north-eastern Nigeria provides an opportunity to bring the conflict to an end.  It is critically important that the recently-established Multinational Joint Taskforce of troops from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin continues its efforts to protect innocent people and to defeat the Boko Haram terrorists.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has joined with our EU partners in congratulating the Nigerian people on the conduct of peaceful national elections in recent weeks.  I also welcome the commitment by President-elect Buhari to prioritise the ending of the conflict in the north east and the terrorist actions of Boko Haram. </p></reply>

The main focus of the resolution was the establishment of an ad hoc committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism.At the time of the vote, the EU explained that it had made extensive efforts and engaged in the process in good faith and reiterated the considerations outlined at the outset of negotiations, as follows:  &ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use. Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.</p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.   Discussions should also make reference to the work in other fora on these issues, such as the Paris Club, which has a history of discussing sovereign debt restructuring issues.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In the event, the resolution continued to propose the elaboration of a new legal framework.  In these circumstances, the agreed EU position is that we will not be participating in the work of the committee.</p>  <p>  Ireland considers that the work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the international conference on Financing for Development, to be held in Addis Ababa in July, offers more appropriate and established means for dialogue on this issue. We are actively engaged in these processes. </p>  <p>  Over recent years, the Government has had an engagement with the European Union, and with international financial institutions, including the IMF, which is unprecedented, both in range and depth.

The EU Delegation&rsquo;s statement expressed regret however that the investigation of their cases has not yet been withdrawn as they are still subjected to &ldquo;bail pending further investigation&rdquo; which entails   restrictions on their freedom of movement and communication.  The EU Delegation also urged China not to restrict the activities of human rights defenders promoting the human rights of women, as the UN is preparing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 4th World Conference on Women and the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action.</p>  <p>  As I stated previously in my reply to the Deputy, Ireland continues to raise human rights issues with third countries including with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.   Ireland also remains committed to advancing gender equality and women&rsquo;s rights and is an active participant in the work of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), the principal global policy-making body on gender equality.  Ireland works to integrate the human rights of women, as well as a gender perspective, into the work of the UN Human Rights Council, including the Council&rsquo;s programme of work, and when considering the content of resolutions and special mandates.</p></reply>

I urge all responsible parties to support this agreement and the continuing work of their governments to finally bring it to a successful conclusion.The extended presence at the negotiations in Lausanne of the EU High Representative and the Foreign Ministers of the seven states involved has been a further testament of the seriousness and intent with which they have pursued a diplomatic solution to this difficult issue over a long period, and in particular over the last two years.    What has been achieved is a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a set of understandings in principle on the shape of a final agreement. Hard and serious work remains to be done to complete the technical details and produce a final agreement by June, as is the intention. There may still be difficulties ahead and a continuing need for compromises, but the parties have reached outline understandings on the main issues, and there is every reason to believe that they will also reach a final agreement. </p>  <p>  The outline agreement will allow Iran to continue to develop its civil nuclear power programme, while providing reassurance to its neighbours and others that there will be no military nuclear programme. The agreement will provide for removal in due course of the sanctions that have been placed on Iran in relation to this dispute, as well as the continued monitoring of the Iranian programme by the appropriate international agency, the IAEA.</p>  <p>  There will be those, on both sides of the issue, who will wish to reject this agreement and seek tougher terms. This is unrealistic. I urge them instead to welcome this agreement as a major step forward towards the peaceful resolution of a long running dispute, which has had the potential to significantly further destabilize an already volatile region. </p>  <p>  The agreement which has been reached is a fair and balanced one, and has, I believe, the overwhelming support of governments and responsible leaders around the world. I commend all those who have worked to achieve it.</p></reply>

Failure to address it effectively will seriously affect all countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s policy for International Development &ldquo;One World One Future&rdquo; was published in May 2013, and identifies &ldquo;Climate Change and Development&rdquo; as one of six priority areas of action.The most severe impact of climate change is on vulnerable people and communities in the least developed countries, in particular women and children. Erratic weather patterns and the increasing number of severe weather events are already having a devastating effect on their lives.  Through our aid programme, Ireland is supporting the affected communities to build their resilience, through the adaptation of agriculture and food systems to climate change, and through assistance to address climate risks and prepare for the effects of disasters.  Over the last three years, we have provided some &euro;34 million annually through the work of the Irish Aid programme in integrating climate change actions into development. These resources are delivered principally through the key partner countries for the aid programme, civil society organisations, and international organisations, mainly for work in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>  <p>  This year, through the aid programme, Ireland will provide &euro;1 million to a fund under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, dedicated to assisting least developed countries to better plan for climate adaptation nationally. In addition, we are providing funding to support these countries to participate in the international climate change negotiations.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that my Department has also been in a position to provide &euro;100,000 in support of the office of the UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, Mary Robinson, as well as facilitation of political outreach for the role at EU level.  Irish Aid has also provided funding in recent years to support the work of the Mary Robinson Foundation Climate Justice  </p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners are determined to work with all Parties towards delivery of an ambitious climate agreement at the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015.</p></reply>

Such statements are particularly regrettable in the tense and inflammatory situation in the Middle East. We know from our own peace process how words of supposed comfort to one side can have disproportionately negative impacts on the other side.   I note that Mr. Netanyahu subsequently stated that his remarks meant only that conditions at present are not conducive to the achievement of a two state solution.</p>  <p>  For its part, the international community has quickly reaffirmed its conviction that the two state solution remains the only viable basis for a resolution of the conflict. High Representative Mogherini on behalf of the EU, President Obama, and others, have made that point directly to Mr. Netanyahu in the course of conversations following the election. </p>  <p>  What is most important is how the new government in Israel, which we expect Mr. Netanyahu to form, actually acts and what is set out in its Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  All of our actions and policies at EU and international level are designed to advance the goal of peace and secure a comprehensive peace agreement at the earliest opportunity.&rdquo;</p></reply>

The new sustainable development agenda should be adopted in New York in September.  It will involve a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which will complete the work of the MDGs on the eradication of extreme poverty and will also put sustainable development at the core.  The SDGs will be universal in nature and address development challenges through social, environmental and economic actions in low, middle and high-income countries alike.  They will address a wide range of areas including MDG priorities such as food and nutrition, but also broader challenges, including on climate, sustainable production and consumption, trade and global governance structures, and peace and governance.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities for the post-2015 Development Agenda have been the fight to end hunger and under nutrition, gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment, and good governance and rule of law.  These priorities are drawn from Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo; and the priorities set out following the Foreign Policy Review, in &lsquo;The Global Island&rsquo;.  Ireland&rsquo;s positions in the UN negotiations and in the relevant EU coordination are agreed through a whole-of-Government coordination process involving all relevant Government Departments.  We have advocated for strong goals and targets in each of these key areas, and we have emphasised the need to incorporate human rights in the new development framework, reduce global inequality and protect the role of civil society.</p>  <p>  The fourth session of the intergovernmental negotiations will take place in New York from 20 to 24 April.</p></reply>

The Foreign Affairs Council meeting that took place in Luxembourg yesterday addressed the subject of Colombia with particular emphasis on how the EU might assist.</p>  <p>  Human rights in Colombia are a major concern for the EU and for Ireland and are addressed in detail in the context of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue.  Through this mechanism, which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian authorities at official level, the Union engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including as regards human rights defenders and trade unionists, land restitution, environmental and economic crimes, and the slow pace in the decrease of impunity.  I believe that this policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny, which is ongoing, regular and structured, is the best way to promote human rights and the interests of labour in Colombia.</p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights is a core principle of Ireland's foreign policy and we have prioritised the protection of trade unionists, human rights defenders, and others who are in immediate danger.  I agree with the view of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that an end to the longstanding armed conflict - now under negotiation between the government and the guerrillas - has the potential to transform Colombia in terms of its level of respect for and enjoyment of human rights.  Ireland and the EU will continue to engage with Colombia to assist in securing a lasting peace in the country.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Bogota on a non-residential basis, is in regular contact on human rights issues with the Colombian authorities, with civil society, and with the EU delegation there. Ireland will continue, together with our EU Partners, to engage with the Colombian government and civil society, to promote and protect human rights.</p></reply>

This conference, the third of its kind, will also assess progress made in the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus of 2002 and the Doha Declaration of 2008.</p>  <p>  The financing for development conference is one of a series of interlinked global negotiations which should reach agreement in the course of 2015 and which will have significant international and domestic implications.  In September, world leaders will meet in New York to adopt a new development framework around a set of Sustainable Development Goals to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000.  It is expected that the new goals will be universal in nature and address challenges in a wide range of areas as diverse as agriculture, education, gender equality, health, justice, employment and environmental degradation.

This is not generally the case for adults of any age and it is the norm internationally to provide standard validity passports to all adults.  Introducing an arrangement whereby adults of any age would be eligible to apply for a passport for a period of less than 10 years would increase the total demand for passports on an ongoing basis and would require the recruitment of additional staff in the Passport Offices to cope with increased demand.  For these reasons, there are no plans to introduce a passport of less than 10 year validity for adult applicants, regardless of age.</p></reply>

There are a number of well-documented reasons for this, not least the key role the EU and the common market play in sustaining the strong British-Irish trading relationship.  Our joint presence within the Union is also especially beneficial to the people of Northern Ireland and cross-border cooperation.  Our focus is therefore on keeping the UK within the EU and we have made this very clear to our British and our European partners, both in public and in private.</p>  <p>  I outlined the Government&rsquo;s position clearly in a speech to the European Council on Foreign Relations in London last November and I had the opportunity to discuss our views in further detail with my British counterpart, Philip Hammond, at a meeting in Dublin the following month.  This Government acknowledges that the UK has some legitimate concerns about the future direction of the EU and we will be open and sympathetic to considering British proposals, if and when they are presented, on improving the functioning of the Union.</p>  <p>  It is clear that a British departure from the European Union could have serious and potentially adverse consequences for Ireland.  That is why the Government is monitoring developments extremely carefully.  The Department of the Taoiseach is leading our work in this area and is coordinating ongoing efforts across Government to ensure that Ireland is best prepared for any scenario that could arise.  The Department of Finance is also examining relevant issues and has commissioned a report to improve our understanding of the macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of our EU membership.</p>  <p>  My own Department, given its responsibility for Foreign Affairs and Trade, is naturally closely involved in this process.  My officials cooperate closely with other Departments and of course, our Embassy in London also plays a vital role, as do many of our other diplomatic missions across the EU and further afield.  There are clearly potential consequences across many areas of my Department&rsquo;s work which require careful consideration.</p>  <p>  I should stress, however, that the matter concerned is one for the whole of Government, rather than any one specific Department.  This is because British membership of the European Union impacts on Ireland on a large array of levels.  This broad interest can be seen, for example, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent address to the CBI in Belfast, and in my colleague Minister Fitzgerald&rsquo;s speech in February to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce in Dublin.

Firstly to see this individual released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland, and secondly to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by me and my officials in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests.</p><p>It is important to bear in mind the role of the Irish Government where citizens are imprisoned abroad. Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  The decision to release this individual either on bail or on any other basis, will be a decision that is made solely by the Egyptian authorities.</p><p>Since this citizen was originally detained in August 2013, I, and officials in my Department including our Embassy in Cairo, have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities regularly and consistently.  In addition, he has received consular visits from Embassy officials on 37 Occasions.</p><p>I can confirm that the Irish Government has formally supported both the application by this citizen&rsquo;s lawyers for his release and return to Ireland under the November Presidential decree, and the more recent application for his release on bail.  Our official support for this citizen&rsquo;s release has been duly communicated to the Egyptian authorities in formal diplomatic notes that have been included in the documentation submitted to the court and the authorities by his lawyer.</p><p><i>I can confirm that I am in ongoing contact with HRVP Mogherini in relation to this case.  I have discussed it with her on numerous occasions, as recently as last week, and she continues to assure me of the support of the EU for our position.</i></p><p>I have also spoken to my Egyptian counterpart on numerous occasions, both in person and on the telephone.  On 4 March I met with Assistant Foreign Minister Hisham Badr and discussed the case with him in some detail.  <i>On 2 April I spoke again with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Shoukry to underline the Government&rsquo;s support for the formal applications that have been made for this individual&rsquo;s release &ndash; both for the formal application for bail, and for the application that has been made for release under the Presidential decree on foreign prisoners.  I also took the opportunity to highlight key humanitarian concerns &ndash; including this individual&rsquo;s youth, his absence from his studies and the length of time in detention without conviction.</i></p><p>The individual&rsquo;s trial has started, with the next hearing scheduled for 26 April.  All of the information we have received indicates that it is highly unlikely that there will be any decision as regards his release until the court makes its decisions.  We continue to review our approach and actions in this case, but we are guided at all times by the two key objectives set out above.  Given that the trial has now commenced and a formal petition for his release on bail is currently being considered by the Egyptian courts, my Department must exercise restraint in its public comment.  This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases, in line with our clear objectives in this case and what we firmly believe to be in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests and to be most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him.</p><p>We remain in ongoing contact with this individual and his family, and will continue to offer full consular support.</p></reply>

For this reason, the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a number of important new mechanisms, including an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, an Oral History Archive and an Implementation and Reconciliation Group to oversee themes, archives and information recovery across the framework for dealing with the legacy of the past.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Agreement provides for a an independent Historical Investigations Unit, which will take forward investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths from the former PSNI Historical Enquiries Team process and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.   It provides further for the Northern Ireland Executive to take appropriate steps to improve the way the legacy inquests function is conducted in Northern Ireland to comply with European Convention on Human Rights Article 2 requirements.  The Agreement sets out that processes dealing with the past should be victim-centred and emphasises the importance of providing services and support to victims and survivors.</p>  <p>  The efficient and expeditious implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in its totality is a key focus for the Government.   On 27 March I participated in a second implementation and review meeting of the Agreement in Belfast with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive Parties.  It was a useful opportunity to take stock of progress, including in relation to our ongoing work in relation to the establishment of the mechanisms for dealing with the past.  Regular meetings are also taking place at official level to bring forward this complex work and good progress is being made.</p>  <p>  The next review of the Stormont House Agreement meeting is scheduled to take place in June.  A six-monthly update on progress on implementation of the Agreement is due to be published at that time, in accordance with the review and monitoring provisions of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to playing its part in ensuring the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.</p></reply>

While supportive of many aspects of the work of the OSCE, the Parliamentary Assembly is independent of the key decision making bodies of the organisation.  State governments are represented in these decision-making bodies, whereas the Parliamentary Assembly facilitates inter-parliamentary dialogue outside of the intergovernmental process.  As such, the Assembly has its own rules and procedures, and any new restructuring initiatives are for the members of the Parliamentary Assembly to decide. However, the Parliamentary Assembly does play an active part in the &lsquo;Helsinki +40&rsquo; reform process launched by my predecessor, the then T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore as Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE in 2012.  &lsquo;Helsinki +40&rsquo; is a three year reform effort  that provides an opportunity to critically examine the OSCE&rsquo;s roles, structures, tools and instruments with a view to making them better suited to the peace and security challenges of the 21st Century in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian region.  The results of extensive consultations under the auspices of the Parliamentary Assembly will be considered at the Assembly&rsquo;s annual meeting in July of this year.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the active engagement of the Parliamentary Assembly in the &lsquo;Helsinki +40&rsquo; process.  Our Permanent Representative in Vienna is special co-ordinator for 'effectiveness and efficiency' issues under the &lsquo;Helsinki +40&rsquo; process.  In that capacity, our Representative regularly engages with the Assembly on proposals aimed at strengthening its role and influence in the service of OSCE objectives.</p></reply>

The issue of voting rights for citizens overseas was raised in a number of submissions received during this process.</p>  <p>  At the time of finalising the Diaspora Policy, two important parallel processes were underway with regard to extending the voting franchise.   Firstly, a working group on Seanad Reform was exploring ways of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann within existing constitutional parameters.  Their report was due after the policy was to be published.  They have since reported to Government and their recommendations propose some significant changes to Seanad voting arrangements which would impact on citizens overseas.  There now needs to be public and political discussion and consultation on the overall content of that report.</p>  <p>  In addition, meeting in September 2013, the members of the Constitutional Convention voted in favour of citizens resident outside the State, including those in Northern Ireland, having the right to vote in Presidential elections.  This recommendation requires consideration of a number of issues that would arise were it to be implemented including policy, legal and practical issues.  The Government has asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in cooperation with myself and the Minister of State for Diaspora Affairs, to analyse the issues arising and to report back to Government.</p>  <p>  The Diaspora Policy notes the ongoing whole of government focus on this issue.

At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union in Brussels on 9 February 2015, which I attended, the Council agreed a number of conclusions on EU priorities at UN Human Rights Fora in 2015. With regard to Sri Lanka, the Council welcomed the commitments by the new Sri Lankan government on rule of law and reconciliation, while encouraging the new Sri Lankan Government to work with the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council to address ongoing human rights concerns and make credible domestic progress on reconciliation.   Our Ambassador to Sri Lanka (who is based in New Delhi) maintains regular contact with the Sri Lankan authorities and regularly visits Sri Lanka for discussions there.  Our Embassy in New Delhi monitors the situation in Sri Lanka on an ongoing basis. Under Irish Aid&rsquo;s funding to NGOs, just over &euro;300,000 in funding has been allocated to NGOs working in Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013.</p>  <p>  At the UN Human Rights Council session in March 2014 Ireland voted in favour of a resolution promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.  One aspect of that resolution was a request for an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka.  A report of that investigation is due to be presented at the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the protection of the rights of Tamil speakers and other minorities, I would note that the Tamil population is widely distributed in Sri Lanka and is not solely confined to the North of the country.  More than one third of the population of Colombo is Tamil, and Tamil is the most widely spoken language in the city.  According to the 2012 census, nearly three quarters of the city&rsquo;s population spoke Tamil as their first language.  It is understood that the new Government have already made some positive steps to deal with resettlement issues, including returning some military land (used for commercial purposes), nomination of a civilian governor in the Northern Province, cancelling the foreign travel restrictions in the North and welcoming Tamil refugees from India.</p>  <p>  A meeting of the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission took place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 2 April 2015.  The Joint Commission, which oversees the EU-Sri Lanka Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development (in place for 20 years) deals with a broad range of bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest.  At this most recent meeting, it was agreed in principle to establish a new Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights, to allow for a dialogue on these issues.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Sri Lanka closely over the coming period.</p></reply>

It also made three other recommendations, detailed below, to which I assume the Deputy is referring.  The Fourth Report was debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 18 December 2014 and the script circulated in the D&aacute;il that day by the Minister of State with special responsibility for Rural Economic Development and Rural Transport setting out the Government&rsquo;s response is available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p>  <p>  The three items referred to above, on which the Convention recommended that referendums be held, and the Government&rsquo;s response on each, are as follows. </p>  <p>  The Convention recommended that there should be a referendum to permit the appointment of non-Oireachtas members as Ministers. However, as the House will be aware, the Constitution already allows the Taoiseach to nominate as Ministers up to two people who have not been elected to the Oireachtas but have been nominated to the Seanad.  This provision enables the thrust of the Convention&rsquo;s recommendation to be met without the need for a referendum.  Taoisigh have availed of this facility only twice since 1937, in each case appointing one person as Minister.  The holding of a referendum to widen the scope of an option that already exists but has very rarely been used, and never to the full, would be very hard to justify.</p>  <p>  The Convention also recommended a referendum to require D&aacute;il members to resign their D&aacute;il seats on appointment to Ministerial office.  However, proposing a referendum to amend the Constitution to this effect would be a major change from the current Constitutional arrangement whereby members of the Government sit in the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  It would be difficult to propose such a referendum without making provision for who would succeed to the vacant seats and to secure the objective of freeing Ministers from constituency work.  However, as regards filling the vacant seats, the Convention had not favoured a list system when considering the D&aacute;il electoral system; and as regards freeing Ministers from constituency work, the Convention did not recommend automatic re-election of Ministers at the next general election.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Convention recommended providing a right for citizens to petition on influencing the legislative agenda and to petition for referendums.  However, referendums are already relatively common in Ireland and there is nothing to prevent citizens presenting petitions.  Also, the Government has already substantially opened up the legislative process to citizens both via the work of the Convention itself and with the various packages of D&aacute;il reform introduced since 2011.  For example, a Public Service Oversight and Petitions Committee, chaired by a member of the Opposition, was established in 2011.  As part of its remit, the Committee receives and considers public petitions submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Committee also engages with the Ombudsman and other oversight bodies.</p>  <p>  In addition, in 2011 the Government introduced a system of pre-legislative review before Oireachtas Committees.  In 2013 this was expanded to become a pre-legislative stage before the relevant Oireachtas Committee as a requirement for non-emergency legislation generally.  This allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public directly in the law making process.  The Committee can consult with citizens with expertise in the area, civic society groups and other interested groups; crucially, such consultation takes place before the legislation is drafted.</p>  <p>  The Government will however bear in mind these recommendations of the Convention when the latest package of D&aacute;il reform, and its success in opening up the legislative process, is being reviewed.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government outlined an ambitious agenda for D&aacute;il Reform to be introduced in a phased process over the lifetime of the Government.  On foot of this, since 2011 the working of the D&aacute;il has been steadily reformed to enhance the legislative role of elected members and improve the working of the House.</p><p>The measures introduced have included the following.</p><p>The number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been significantly increased by reducing the length of D&aacute;il breaks at Christmas, Easter, bank holidays and the summer and introducing regular Friday sitting days.  Since 2011, the D&aacute;il has sat 31 more days per year (33%), with an average 124 sitting days per year, than the previous D&aacute;il, which had an average of 93 days per year.</p><p>The first phase of the D&aacute;il Reform Programme was introduced in the summer of 2011 and included:</p><p>- An additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the T&aacute;naiste</p><p>- Topical Issues Debates to replace the outmoded Adjournment Debates so as to give Deputies an opportunity to raise issues directly with Ministers from the relevant Department</p><p>- Friday sittings to enable Deputies to play a fuller role in the legislative process by introducing their own Bills and having those Bills debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il</p><p>-A mechanism for appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if a Deputy is unhappy with the reply received to a Parliamentary Question</p><p>-A Pre-Legislative review system where by Ministers could provide the Heads of a Bill to the Oireachtas Committee to review before the Bill was published</p><p>- Restructuring of the Oireachtas Committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16</p><p>- Introducing a new Oireachtas Committee chaired by an Opposition Deputy to work with Ombudsmen's offices and review petitions. </p><p>In the summer of 2012, further reforms to the Oireachtas Committee system were introduced, which streamlined the structure and provided an additional focus on areas of priority such as Jobs and Agriculture.</p><p>In September 2013 the Government announced the second phase of D&aacute;il Reforms and the D&aacute;il debated and approved changes to Standing Orders in October 2013.  These reforms are being phased in and include changes to allow more public involvement in the law making process:</p><p>- A Pre-Legislative Stage before an Oireachtas Committee is now a general requirement for non-emergency legislation.  A Minister who does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage is required to explain that decision to the D&aacute;il.</p><p>- The new Pre-Legislative Stage allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law making.  The Committee can consult with experts and civic society groups; crucially, this takes place before the legislation is drafted.</p><p>-Where there has been a Pre-Legislative Stage, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee has an opportunity to outline the Committee's work to the members of the D&aacute;il during the Second Stage debate after the Minister and main opposition spokespeople have spoken on the Bill</p><p>- By 28 February 2015, Oireachtas Committees had completed 39 Pre&ndash;Legislative Stages resulting in 37 Reports and two letters being sent to sponsoring Ministers.  </p><p>In addition, each year the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government&rsquo;s annual priorities, with Ministers setting out their Department&rsquo;s plans.</p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has also been expanded.</p><p>As a result of a set of reforms introduced to reduce the use of the guillotine, only three Bills were guillotined in the D&aacute;il in 2014, down from 12 in 2013 and 19 in 2010.  This has been achieved by reforms including a reduction in the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year increasing the time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il by increasing the total number of sitting days, extending the length of sitting days and starting at 9.30 am on Wednesday and Thursdays. </p><p>The way legislation is debated in the Chamber has been improved:</p><p>- At First Stage the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now has five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain the reasons for proposing it.</p><p>- Where proposed legislation has been the subject of Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, at Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage has a speaking slot, of the same length as that of the Minister and Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on the Committee's findings.</p><p>- At the end of the Second Stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies, chosen by the Ceann Comhairle, who have previously spoken. </p><p>The number of Friday sittings has been expanded and the D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and Committee Reports selected using a lottery system.  The new Friday sittings also allow Committees, for the first time, to seek directly to have their own reports debated in the D&aacute;il.  This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of Bills introduced by Deputies, from 14 published in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.  82 Private Member's Bills were debated in the four years to 6 March 2015, compared to 16 debated in the 30th D&aacute;il, and 21 Committee Reports have been debated, compared to nine debated in the 30th D&aacute;il.</p><p>The system of Topical Issues now requires the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department to reply; if this is not the case, the Deputy who raised the issue can have it deferred until a Minister or Minister of State from that Department is available.</p><p>The time allocated to Oral Parliamentary Questions to Ministers has been standardised to 75 minutes. An ordinary Oral Question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber when it is reached and the Deputy is given a brief period, of 30 seconds, to outline the question. </p><p>The Government also passed the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges &amp;amp; Procedures) Act 2013 and the Standing Orders to establish Oireachtas Inquiry system are now in place.  The Banking Inquiry is the first Oireachtas Inquiry established under this new legislation.</p><p>D&aacute;il Reform is an ongoing process and the Government intend, in the next few months, to bring forward a further package of reforms for consideration.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, for which Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.  Rent supplement expenditure figures from 1999 are provided in the tabular statement below; separate rent supplement expenditure data for the years: 1989; 1993; 1996 are not available.</p><p>Details of the current maximum rent limits on a county basis are provided in the tabular statement below.  The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.  The review finds that increasing the rent limits would have several potentially negative effects, including providing an impetus for current rent supplement landlords to renegotiate their lease agreements to the new limits impacting on all existing recipients at significant cost to the Exchequer.  </p><p>In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the country, including those in the Louth area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits if deemed appropriate.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.</p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 1,000 recipients mentioned above, over 500 households in Dublin and some 12 in Cork city have been provided assistance through increased rent limits under the Protocol.</p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.

To this end, the Department provides a wide range of income and work related supports for people with disabilities, which play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Among these supports is the Employability service, which supports people with disabilities who wish to take up employment.  The service currently comprises 23 limited companies, each with a specific geographical remit and each fully funded by the Department.  The budget for 2015 provides &euro;9.6 million to run the service. 80 per cent of these costs are attributed to staff costs while 20 per cent are related to overhead costs, such as accommodation. </p>  <p>  The average cost of the Employability Service is &euro;2,900 per client.  If the service was expanded by 1,000 clients, the estimated additional annual cost would be &euro;2.9 million. While the service supports around 3,000 people at any one time, on average, some 2,600 clients exit the service every year.  Removing the 18 month time-limit on support would effectively represent an expansion of the service which would cost around &euro;7.66 million a year compounding.</p>  <p>  While the Employability service operates in the context of jobs in the open-labour market, data in relation to the sustainability of such jobs is not available as the service is not in a position to monitor persons&rsquo; economic activity after they have exited the service. </p>  <p>  Employability is focused on supporting, through job coaches, people with disabilities in the open labour market.  Participants must be motivated to work and be able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week.  The service is open to people between the ages of 18 to 65 years.

Early interventions and developing return to work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with the Department&rsquo;s own policy approach to illness/disability income support which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.</p>  <p>  I should mention that the &ldquo;Renaissance project&rdquo; wherein early intervention was shown to reduce the incidence of progression from the acute simple low back pain to chronic disability in 64% of claimants, is an initiative of the Department since 2003,</p>  <p>  I would also refer to the partial capacity benefit scheme which I introduced in 2012.  This facilitates people who are in receipt of illness benefit or invalidity pension and who wish to take up/resume employment to do so and still retain a portion of their social welfare payment. This scheme is now being reviewed by the Department to examine its effectiveness.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that the Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Adviser has drafted a set of certification guidelines, setting out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions (including musculoskeletal disorders) for guidance of GPs and these will be distributed to GPs shortly.</p></reply>

The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 provided for the transfer of responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) to the Citizens Information Board (CIB), under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection.  The legislative provisions governing CIB are contained in the Comhairle Act, 2000, the Citizens Information Act, 2007 and the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011.</p><p>While oversight of the CIB is exercised by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) in line with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, the CIB is also accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The CIB&rsquo;s annual report is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A senior official of DSP sits on the Board of CIB and there is regular liaison between officials of DSP and the CIB executive.</p><p>CIB delivers on its remit to provide services to the public by supporting a network of delivery partners which includes 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS) and 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS).  Each of these 93 independent companies in the network has a separate voluntary Board of Management.  Each of these Boards has an average of over 9 members resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The number of board members in the 51 local MABS companies amounts to over 400 and a breakdown by company is included in the following table.</p><p>The Citizens Information Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place for expenditure of allocated public funds.  Service level agreements are in place with each delivery partner company and cover standard items such as service delivery, governance, financial controls, HR practices, reporting, evaluation and monitoring.  The use of service level agreements enables the CIB to ensure that excellent service and best value is achieved across the wide range of services it provides.</p><p>In 2015, the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46 million of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  The annual allocation of State funds from CIB to the MABS network of companies over the last five years was as follows &ndash;</p><p>2011  &euro;18.4m; 2012 &euro;18.3m; 2013  &euro;19.0m; 2014 &euro;18.6m; and 2015 &euro;17.9m.</p><p>The following table shows the funding allocation to the 51 local MABS local companies over the past five years, the number of Board members per company (as registered with audited accounts submitted to Companies Registration Office for 2013), the cost of each Board, including professional fees andthe % cost of the Boards relative to overall

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities in returning to the labour market.  </p>  <p>  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract was set to reflect a number of inter-related elements.  These include the need to ensure that the numbers of placements available are open to those on the live register, that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements are not replicated in T&uacute;s, optimisation of the resources available, and to ensure that T&uacute;s fits with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies in Pathways to Work.</p>  <p>  This approach ensures that as many people as possible who are unemployed for over 12 months are able to benefit from the initiative.  There are no circumstances under which a participant&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s will be extended beyond 12 months and I consider the existing 12-month period on the scheme to be adequate to meet the programme&rsquo;s objectives.  As of the week ending 17th April 2015, there were 7,952 participants on T&uacute;s.  Some 25,194 participants have commenced employment on T&uacute;s since its commencement to date, including those currently on the scheme.  </p>  <p>  I disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that the use of schemes such as T&uacute;s, community employment, Gateway, back to education and back to work allowance are being used to manipulate the national unemployment figures.  The Deputy should note that the Central Statistics Office publish data on the participation levels on these schemes as part of the monthly live register report in a transparent and open fashion.  There is full recognition that these schemes provide a short-term response to the unemployment crisis and that work a resurgent economy will provide employment opportunities.  These programmes, and others such as JobsPlus, help to ensure that the longer-term unemployed are in a position to avail of arising opportunities.</p>  <p>  It is regrettable that the Deputy should misrepresent the efforts of employers in the community and voluntary sector, who provide work placement opportunities under T&uacute;s and Community Employment, as exploiting the unemployed and as unscrupulous employers.  He fails to recognise the enormous commitment and effort of volunteers working to improve the communities across the country and the standard of employer engagement and support required when dealing with jobseekers that may have been out of the workforce for prolonged periods of time.</p></reply>

This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014. </p>  <p>  Eligibility for State Pension Non-Contributory is means tested and takes into account the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.  Capital, property (excluding a person's home), savings and investments, occupational pension, a British or other foreign pension, are assessed as capital and a formula is then used to assess the weekly means from capital.  The weekly rate payable depends on the total weekly means of the person or couple.  The first 30 euro of means is disregarded for State Pension Non-Contributory.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note where an applicant has also been insurably employed in another EU Member State, or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, their insured periods in those countries may be combined with their Irish insurance to assess their entitlement to a pro-rata State pension (contributory).  In addition to the general provisions under EU legislation (which apply to all EU Member States, EEA States; Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and to Switzerland), Ireland has bilateral agreements with the UK which also cover the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, USA, Australia, Canada, Quebec (which has a separate system from the rest of Canada), New Zealand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.  EU legislation and bilateral agreements provide that comparative pension assessments (for standard-rate State pension contributory under Irish legislation alone, and for pro-rata State pension contributory under EU or bilateral agreement provisions) be undertaken, and whichever is the most financially beneficial pension entitlement for that pensioner is awarded.  As the State pension (contributory) is not means-tested, the rate of such a pension would not be reduced as a result of private pension provision.</p>  <p>  It may be of interest that, in the case of Carer's Allowance, where the carer receives a social welfare payment from another State, an amount up the maximum rate of the Irish State Pension Contributory is exempt from the means test.  Any foreign social welfare payment in excess of the maximum Irish State Pension Contributory is treated as income for the means test.</p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-21a.303.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042100058#WRF02800"><p>The marriage bar was a condition of the employment in the public service until 1973.  Issues relating to public sector employment and pensions are the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In general, civil and public servants recruited at that time paid a modified rate of PRSI (i.e. not the full Class A rate) which gave coverage for widow(er)'s and orphan's pensions, occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit only.  It did not provide cover for the State pension.  The modified rate of social insurance was a condition of employment for public servants at that time.  Accordingly, even if those affected by the marriage bar had continued in employment, contributions paid at this rate would not have given entitlement to a State pension (contributory) under the social welfare system.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).</p></reply>

While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputy that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery. </p><p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2014, &euro;15.073m was allocated to the 51 local MABS companies, which had an active client caseload of some 20,000.  A breakdown of cases handled by the 51 local companies and the allocation for each company is included in the Appendix.  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46m of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  </p><p>There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of 9.2 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration.  Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.</p><p>The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS services could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only.  All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected.  Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before.  It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services.  It is also important to note that neither this option nor any alternative has yet been considered by the Board of CIB.  Accordingly, no decisions have been made by the Board and no proposal has been formally made to my Department for consideration.  Therefore, it is not possible at this juncture to speculate on what changes may occur in the governance of any of the services in any location.  It is expected that the Design Group proposal, when further developed, will be formally submitted to the Board of CIB for its consideration.</p><p><b>APPENDIX 1</b><table><tr><th>MABS</th><th>Funding (2014)</th><th>Active Client caseload on 31/12/2014</th></tr><tr><td>Arklow</td><td>230,200</td><td>191</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>159,300</td><td>236</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun</td><td>379,700</td><td>437</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>354,300</td><td>506</td></tr><tr><td>Bray</td><td>348,000</td><td>447</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>339,800</td><td>876</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>278,300</td><td>704</td></tr><tr><td>Charleville</td><td>199,800</td><td>210</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>281,200</td><td>632</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>371,600</td><td>373</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>435,400</td><td>896</td></tr><tr><td>Drogheda</td><td>176,654</td><td>203</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 10 &amp;amp; 20</td><td>371,287</td><td>244</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin 12 Area</td><td>292,200</td><td>198</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City</td><td>290,279</td><td>244</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North East</td><td>280,095</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East</td><td>299,300</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>228,000</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk/Oriel</td><td>250,660</td><td>383</td></tr><tr><td>Dundrum/Rathfarnham</td><td>337,686</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal (North County)</td><td>310,900</td><td>343</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas/Cabra</td><td>342,100</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>520,592</td><td>853</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>475,800</td><td>447</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>282,400</td><td>605</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>216,500</td><td>222</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>206,990</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td>Liffey South West</td><td>373,800</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>386,199</td><td>560</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>173,817</td><td>251</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>299,261</td><td>635</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>263,800</td><td>473</td></tr><tr><td>Mullingar</td><td>192,090</td><td>306</td></tr><tr><td>North Cork</td><td>305,000</td><td>485</td></tr><tr><td>North Donegal</td><td>370,500</td><td>243</td></tr><tr><td>North Galway</td><td>234,800</td><td>302</td></tr><tr><td>North Mayo</td><td>212,400</td><td>269</td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary</td><td>259,900</td><td>395</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>238,979</td><td>211</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>194,300</td><td>217</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>251,500</td><td>291</td></tr><tr><td>South Donegal</td><td>150,800</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>South Galway</td><td>516,900</td><td>758</td></tr><tr><td>South Mayo</td><td>287,600</td><td>215</td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary</td><td>376,700</td><td>534</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>316,829</td><td>733</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>503,600</td><td>799</td></tr><tr><td>West Cork</td><td>287,400</td><td>350</td></tr><tr><td>West Donegal</td><td>126,800</td><td>245</td></tr><tr><td>West Waterford</td><td><div>166,254</div></td><td><div>337</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>324,900</div></td><td><div>605</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>&euro;15,073,171 </div></td><td><div>19,998</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. However, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.  However, as I have stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p>  <p>  That said, the Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, stated last November that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants when, in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 introduced changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish banking sector and there is some evidence of improvements in the banking sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model. In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.</p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates. The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.</p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly. The Governor will update me on progress in due course.</p></reply>

Therefore, while routine dental treatment does not qualify for tax relief, where other non-routine dental procedures are undertaken, the services of a practitioner (including the cost of attendance), registered under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 or the Dentists Act 1985, and the diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of such a practitioner would qualify for relief.</p></reply>

The Regulation was directly applicable in Member States when the legislation entered into force on 1 January 2014, and the CRD IV Directive was transposed into Irish law by the Minister for Finance on 31 March 2014. The Central Bank of Ireland was designated as the authority with competence to perform the functions under the CRR and CRD IV including macro prudential powers such as imposing a countercyclical capital buffer, systemically important institutions buffers and the ability to tighten a range of micro-prudential instruments. Following the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) on 4 November 2014, the SSM took overall responsibility for setting bank's regulatory capital requirements. Nonetheless, the Central Bank, through its participation in the SSM, still plays a significant role in determining regulatory capital requirements. </p>  <p>  Tackling mortgage arrears is a priority for the Government. A whole-of-Government approach has been adopted in addressing the issue with a view to maximising the level of loan restructuring arrangements and minimising the number of home repossessions.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is also continuing to take action in this area. On 2 April the Central Bank reported that the lenders covered by the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets met the Central Bank requirements for Q4 2014. Furthermore, the Central Bank announced that it had determined that relying on common quarterly targets was no longer appropriate and instead they have written to each bank setting out new requirements, including that concluded sustainable solutions are in place for the vast majority of distressed borrowers by the end of 2015. The Central Bank remains focused on ensuring that the banks continue to improve issues identified in relation to their individual systems and procedures to ensure that they resolve arrears cases by implementing sustainable solutions for distressed borrowers in a fair manner.</p></reply>

However, the CBI website contains data which shows the number of PDH and BTL accounts that are in arrears of more than 360 days.  It can be accessed at the following link, </p><p>It is important to  stress, however, that these figures do not necessarily imply that no payment has been made on these accounts for more than one year. It means that the arrears balance on these accounts is equivalent to 360 (or more) days past due. For example, if a consumer made half repayments for a period of two years, then an account would have an arrears balance equivalent to one year of missed repayments.  It is also the case that my own Department's mortgage arrears data is set out in a similar way and does not include a breakdown of the number of PDH and BTL mortgage accounts on which no payment has been made for more than one year.  </p><p>The numbers show that in the vast majority of cases engagement between banks and borrowers works.  According to CBI data, almost 115,000 mortgage accounts were classified as re-structured at the end of 2014.  This represented an increase of about 30,000 accounts over the course of 2014. 85% of these restructured mortgages were deemed to be meeting the terms of their restructure arrangement and for some solutions it reached well over 90%. Real solutions tailored to the needs of borrowers are available where engagement takes place.The challenge is to encourage borrowers and lenders who are in long term arrears situations to engage and reach solutions.</p></reply>

The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly.  The Governor will update me on progress in due course.</p></reply>

In the Central Bank's 'Outline of the Administrative Sanctions Procedure' paragraph 3.6.1 a) notes that "(t)he Central Bank may decide to pursue suspected contraventions through the Administrative Sanctions Procedure instead of bringing a summary prosecution. However, the Central Bank will consider the circumstances of each case on its merits and may decide to pursue matters which constitute both a prescribed contravention and a criminal offence via the criminal courts. In deciding whether to pursue criminal proceedings, the Central Bank will exercise its discretion, having regard to the Director of Public Prosecution's "Guidelines for Prosecutors".  The particular circumstances of each case are considered on their own merits to decide if it is appropriate to exercise the statutory discretion to take action in respect of a suspected offence/contravention. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

It is not a necessary condition that these outdoor education lessons take place during school hours or indeed in a school setting but it is a necessary condition that the lessons are similar to the programme, objectives and outcomes set out in the Department of Education and Science syllabus.  In contrast, where similar activities are provided by Outdoor Education Centres to adults they are generally liable to VAT since they are regarded as purely recreational.</p>  <p>  I would point out that an establishment or person who provides such VAT-exempt education does not register for VAT and does not charge VAT on the supply of their services.  Persons who are exempt from VAT cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services used for their provision of education, such as the purchase of fuel or IT equipment or software licenses.  </p></reply>

The restructuring of the credit achieves such an outcome.</p>  <p>  The person who cares for the child for most of the year is entitled to the credit in the first instance. Agreement as to who will be the primary carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians. However, only the primary carer is entitled to the credit.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one), on the basis that the relevant child is not, in the main, being cared for by a single person. In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer. In addition, a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.</p>  <p>  There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code. Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  In certain cases, such couples also need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example. </p>  <p>  While I understand the difficulties being experienced by those that cannot avail of the SPCCC, I am satisfied that the credit targets limited Exchequer resources to where they are needed most. In addition, it is not a function of the tax system to incentivise shared custody and shared parenting responsibilities.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

These decreases were implemented by introducing PSPR at special low rates on post-February 2012 pensions, while at the same time adjusting upwards the PSPR rates applying to earlier-awarded pensions.</p><p>The best available estimate of the requested breakdown of the annual PSPR saving, based on pension distribution  in 2012, is provided below:</p><p>Pensions awarded to or in respect of public servants retiring or reaching preserved pension age on or before 29 February 2012:</p><p>Pension levelEstimated Saving</p><p>&euro;12,000 - &euro;24,000 &euro;10.4 million</p><p>&euro;24,000 - &euro;60,000 &euro;93.7 million</p><p>&amp;gt; &euro;60,000&euro;18.7 million  </p><p>Pensions awarded to or in respect of public servants retiring or reaching preserved pension age on or after 1 March 2012:</p><p>Pension levelEstimated Saving</p><p>&euro;12,000 - &euro;24,000 &euro;0</p><p>&euro;24,000 - &euro;60,000 &euro;2.0 million</p><p>&amp;gt; &euro;60,000&euro;0.4 million </p></reply>

The legislation gives me as Minister no role in the valuation of property. Under the Valuation Act 2001 as it stands, a Community Sports Club that has a licence under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, has all of its premises taken into account when valued.</p>  <p>  The legislation in this area is being changed. The Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 was passed by both houses of the Oireachtas on 16th   April 2015. After the Bill is enacted and on its commencement an amendment to Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 will take effect and will provide a partial exemption from commercial rates for Community Sports Clubs that are licensed under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904. It will mean that for Community Sports Clubs that can have a bar, it will only be the commercial parts of their premises that will be valued for rates purposes rather than a valuation of all of their premises which is what happens under the current legislation. I am pleased to have been able to introduce an amendment which will give relief to local sports clubs who fulfil an important role in our communities and to resolve a long standing anomaly in the legislation. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that, after the commencement of  the Valuation Amendment Act 2015, his office will initiate a process of updating the valuation lists for community sports clubs that will benefit from the amendment to Schedule 4. This process will involve seeking information from Community Sports Clubs so that the necessary changes to the valuation lists can be made. Any changes resulting from an amendment to Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 will be made in 2015 and will be effective for rates purposes in 2016. The calculation and collection of commercial rates is a matter for Local Authorities.   </p></reply>

Since these negotiations started with the US in 2013, eight negotiating rounds have taken place.  The 9th round is taking place in New York this week from 20 to 24 April 2015.  It is hoped that there will be substantial advancement in the TTIP negotiations in 2015.   According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  Right across the range of issues covered by TTIP, I will ensure we are best positioned to make the most from these and other trade and investment opportunities in order to maximise any potential benefits for Irish companies and citizens.</p>  <p>  A study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1% and increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. It also suggests that Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be particular beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the TTIP negotiations will be assisted by the indications from this study.  Our priorities include advancing regulatory cooperation and common rules which aim to make trade and investment easier especially for SMEs, and protecting our interests in any sensitive areas, including beef.  </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the Commission in these negotiations which aim to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive agreement contributing to growth and jobs both here and the EU.

The funding allocated is outlined in the following tabular statement.  In February last, I announced details of the 5-year, &euro;250 million Regional Action Plan for Jobs, aimed at accelerating the jobs recovery in every part of the country.  The Regional Action Plan is based on the principle that the best way to support job-creation in towns and villages across the country is to support agencies and organisations within 8 regions, to build on the particular strengths and assets of their area and drive new job-creation strategies and projects. </p><p>Under the Regional Plan, Enterprise Ireland will launch a series of new competitive funding initiatives in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation, enterprise infrastructure and job creation.  An initial fund of &euro;50 million is to be made available for three competitive calls.  The first of these competitive calls, with a budget of &euro;5 million, will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation. </p><p>The Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund call will be open to existing Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) and also to any other organisation or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports.  It should be open to any credible and novel approach rather than simply replicating what has been done before.  It is expected that details of this Scheme will be announced shortly.</p><p>The criteria in any such competition will be announced by Enterprise Ireland, but the typical criteria will include:</p><p>- A credible plan demonstrating innovative solutions to fostering and creating employment locally and regionally in a collaborative manner;</p><p>- Demonstration of how a proposal fits with existing public and private infrastructure e.g. availability of business space in creating enterprise hubs and clusters across the region;</p><p>- Promotion of a culture of entrepreneurship locally and regionally;</p><p>- Development of a capability to start-up and scale companies through a supportive business environment;</p><p>- Support for micro enterprise with the potential to export;</p><p>- Facilitating a hub where innovative start-ups can be established in a supportive network before moving on to accommodate the next cohort of emerging enterprises;</p><p>- Working with the Local Enterprise Office, to facilitate start-ups with a defined path for onward progression;</p><p>- Maximising existing enterprise clusters or developing new networks in a region;</p><p>- Building on existing strengths or opportunities, e.g. developing a sectoral opportunity where there is a competitive advantage;</p><p>- Commitment of matching finance;</p><p>- Bringing originality in approach and objectives, and leveraging other stakeholders to explore how all the local partners, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation in their region (Mentoring, funding, networks);</p><p>- Promoting public and private partnership, e.g. alignment, collaboration with other players (e.g. LEO, ETB, HEIs, and Chambers of Commerce etc.)<table><tr><th>Amount allocated to each Community Enterprise Centre Client under the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme for Business Development Management rolled out in 2012/2013</th><th>Amount Allocated<br /><br />&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>IRD Kiltimagh Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Bailieborough Development Association Ltd</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Convoy Enterprise Centre Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ballinasloe Area Community Development Ltd</td><td>48,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mitchelstown Community Forum Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>St Paul's Area Development Enterprise Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>The Bolton Trust</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Drumshanbo Community Council Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clonmel Business Development Park Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Croom Community Development Association Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Drumshanbo Enterprise Centre Co Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Hatherton Ltd</td><td>35,090</td></tr><tr><td>Balbriggan Enterprise &amp;amp; Training Centre Ltd</td><td>43,700</td></tr><tr><td>Action Community &amp;amp; Enterprise Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Navan Enterprise Centre Co Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Enniscorthy Enterprise &amp;amp; Technology Centre Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Macroom Environmental Industrial Park Ltd</td><td>30,000</td></tr><tr><td>IRD North Mayo - West Sligo Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Enterprise Park Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Portarlington Enterprise Centre Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow Community Enterprise Centres Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Enterprise Fund</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Action Tuam Ltd</td><td>23,400</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock Development Council Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Killarney Technology Innovation Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Arklow Business Enterprise Centre Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Get Tallaght Working Co-Op Ltd</td><td>49,838</td></tr><tr><td>Get Tallaght Working Co-Op Ltd</td><td>46,565</td></tr><tr><td>Louth Craftmark Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mullingar Employment Action Group</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dunhill Rural Enterprises Ltd</td><td>36,000</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Technology Centre Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ferbane Business &amp;amp; Technology Park Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clane Project Centre Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Allenwood Community Development Association Ltd</td><td>45,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Enterprise Fund</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny Community Enterprise Centre Ltd</td><td>17,000</td></tr><tr><td>Athy Community Enterprise Company Limited</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Boyle Chamber of Commerce </td><td>35,000</td></tr><tr><td>Drogheda Enterprise Centre Ltd</td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Enterprise Development Partnership Limited </td><td>50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mountmellick Development Association Limited</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>S.C.C.U.L.

Under competition law, wholesalers may refuse to supply retailers for a wide range of legitimate reasons and there is no general obligation under that Act whereby a wholesaler must, in all circumstances, fulfil supply requests from retailers.  Legitimate refusals to fulfil such requests may benefit from the exemptions from competition law set out in the Declaration, and in section 4(5) of the Competition Act 2002.  Refusals to supply, which arise pursuant to an agreement between competitors, or as part of a dominant firm&rsquo;s strategy to remove a competitor from the marketplace, may give rise to concerns under competition law, although such cases are invariably very specific.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of matters that may require investigation, he should refer any specific complaints directly to the CCPC.

Independent legal advice should be sought if an individual has concerns about a specific employment situation.  The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 lay down criteria by which the fairness or otherwise of dismissals are adjudicated upon.  While the Acts provide for some potentially fair reasons for dismissal, the onus is generally on the employer to show that there were substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  Each case is adjudicated upon on its merits and on the facts of each case.  The normal time limit of 6 months for submitting a claim for redress for unfair dismissal may be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances. </p>  <p>  If an employee believes that he or she has been unfairly dismissed within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, it is for the Rights Commissioners Service and-or the Employment Appeals Tribunal to adjudicate upon the matter in circumstances where a complaint has been made by an employee.  I should mention that the relevant adjudicatory bodies for cases referred after the enactment and commencement of the Workplace Relations Bill 2014 will be an Adjudication Officer of the new Workplace Relations Commission and, on appeal, the Labour Court. </p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of information on employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, the Information Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has been restructured and expanded to form a new Workplace Relations Customer Service Section.

A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the relevant parties. Consequently, there is absolutely no prohibition on employers and employees setting down a retirement age which goes beyond what might be considered the normal retirement age in society or the age at which the State pension is payable.</p><p>The upper age limit for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004.  It is now the case that a person of any age, when dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless she or he has reached the &ldquo;normal retiring age for employees of the same employer in similar employment&rdquo;, if one exists.  In such circumstances, the burden of proof is<b></b>on the employer to prove the normal retiring age.  Furthermore, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Acts 2007. </p><p>However, as the issue that arises around compulsory retirement at a given age is whether this entails discrimination on age grounds, the more usual avenue of redress for employees compulsorily retired is to take a claim, under the Employment Equality Acts, to the Equality Tribunal.  </p><p>Responsibility for employment equality legislation rests with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald T.D.  I am advised by my colleague that while Section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Acts provides that it is not unlawful for an employer to fix a compulsory retirement age for employees, the courts at national and European level, and the Equality Tribunal, have applied this having regard to the terms of Framework Directive 2000/78/EC as requiring that a compulsory retirement age must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. </p></reply>

My ambition is to ensure we can track the performance of the enterprise base on a continuous basis and have timely data so as to take corrective action where appropriate. </p>  <p>  In this context my Department is in the process of developing a monthly Dashboard of Statistics, gathering together the most relevant internal data on the enterprise base, together with national enterprise relevant statistics and other indicators of enterprise performance as published by third parties.  Among the key enterprise indicators currently being collected and we are considering publishing in a composite form include data on job announcements, on job vacancies, on work permits and on redundancy notifications.  The CSO publishes data regularly in relation to the cost base for enterprise, such as in relation to labour costs, energy and other utilities and services to business costs.  There are a wider range of indicators published by third parties that are of interest in terms of the performance of the enterprise base that we are reviewing including in relation to purchasing managers&rsquo; indices, trade and investment data and broader labour force statistics from the CSO. </p>  <p>  My Department currently collects a range of data that can potentially provide indicators on the health of the enterprise base.  My Department provides a range of important regulatory and other business environment support services to enterprise, through which we can ascertain relevant trends on business activity levels in the economy.  These activities include, for example, the work of the Companies Registration Office and the Patents Office, of NERA, the Health and Safety Authority, the Workplace Relations Commission.  These bodies publish their activity data on a regular basis.  My Department is also responsible for the issuing of work permits and receives information on redundancies notifications.  The enterprise surveys activity previously carried out by Forf&aacute;s is now also being undertaken by the Strategic Policy Division within my Department and the results are also published on regular basis.  In addition, the Strategic Policy Division continues to support the work of the National Competitiveness Council and continue to prepare benchmarking and data rich reports, such as on the costs of doing business and on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness scorecard.  I envisage we can combine in so far as possible these various enterprise related data points in the monitoring and tracking of enterprise performance and potential as part of the new Dashboard of Statistics.  The data is being collected by officials in the relevant units and Divisions of the Department, in consultation with relevant agencies and offices of the Department, and is being compiled by the Strategic Policy Division.  </p>  <p>  The data as currently compiled for the Dashboard does not include any company specific data or information and nor is it intended that company specific data be included in the future.

In this context, a number of policy initiatives targeted at accelerating the return on our investment in STI have been introduced.  Amongst these is the implementation of the proposals of the Research Prioritisation Group which identified 14 priority areas around which the majority of competitive funding should be targeted.  The areas were identified on the basis of existing strengths of the public research system and our enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and areas which can address a national or global challenge to which Ireland should respond.  Evidence, from both the EU and internationally, shows that this strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our STI investment is paying off.  Ireland is ranked third in the EU, according to the European Commission&rsquo;s &quot;Indicator of Innovation Output&rdquo;, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. </p><p>All of the national indicators show that our focus on commercialisation of research is having an impact.  The number of technologies licensed to industry, which is one of the most relevant indicators of commercialisation performance in the research system, rose significantly from 12 in 2005 to 139 in 2013 and invention disclosures and spin outs also increased substantially during that period.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s collaboration activities produce quantifiable increases in company turnover that are as much as seven times the level of investment in these instruments.  For example, a recent independent evaluation of the Innovation Voucher scheme found that for every &euro;1 invested in the scheme, company turnover increased by over &euro;7.  Similarly, a recent independent evaluation of the Innovation Partnership programme found that for every &euro;1 invested, company turnover increased by over &euro;6.69.  This evaluation also found that, for every &euro;1 of Enterprise Ireland funding invested in the Innovation Partnership programme,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>&euro;0.50 of industry investment was leveraged, enabling the programme to be 50% larger than it would have been if entirely funded by Enterprise Ireland.  These externally validated impacts serve to confirm our approach, while the system of rigorous and continuous programme evaluations ensures that an effective and impactful suite of innovation supports are offered to industry.  In addition the Government established Knowledge Transfer Ireland in 2013 which plays a key role in the Irish innovation system and makes it easier for companies to access and use ideas developed through publicly-funded research to develop new products and services and ultimately create jobs and exports.</p><p>With regard to the balance of funding for basic and applied research, Government policy has been, and will continue to be, to support research across the full continuum from basic to applied, through to commercialisation of research.  Statistical evidence which supports this fact is contained in early figures from the latest survey of investment in Higher Education Research and Development (HERD).  This shows that, for the academic year 2012-2013, 50.9% of the total HERD budget was on basic research, which compares to a figure of 55% pertaining to the academic year 2006/07. </p></reply>

A high proportion of the area cleared are plantations which were associated with infected imported batches but which were not necessarily infected.  These associated plantations were destroyed on a precautionary basis.  This work involved the uprooting and deep burial of circa 2 million ash trees since late 2012.  The findings in forestry plantations were all privately owned apart from one Coillte site.  Infected ash has also been destroyed by deep burial or burning in privately owned non-forestry locations such as horticultural nurseries, gardens and farm and agri-environment plantings.  There have also been findings in roadsides which have been subject to eradication measures.

The aim of this project, which commenced recently, is to develop a model that predicts the spatial risk of infection of <i>Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus</i>fungus (the infective agent of ash die-back disease, <i>Chalara fraxinea</i>).  The Department has committed &euro;67,091 to this project over a 12 month period.  Research on disease resistance in ash is being undertaken by Forest Research, an agency of the British Forestry Commission; this work is being part funded by my Department.  As part of this project, Irish ash plants have been planted out over a range of sites in the South East of England to test for resistance.  So far the Department has contributed &euro;14,000 towards the cost of this research.  Further research is underway by Teagasc which is supported by my Department on disease resistance in ash.  In 2014 Teagasc started a four year project with the aim of procuring individual trees of ash which show resistance/tolerance to Chalara.  These trees will then be used to bulk up stocks of resistant trees, as well as for establishing seed producing orchards with resistant parent trees.  This work is being funded from within the Department&rsquo;s normal subvention to Teagasc.  In terms of resources applied by my Department on informing and educating growers, farmers and the general public on Chalara, every opportunity has been taken to provide information on Ash dieback, not all of which incurred expenditure.  The information measures undertaken included the provision of articles and photos for national publications, including a comprehensive article in October 2013.  There was also a full page article on Ash Dieback, with photographs, in Issue No. 10 of the Forest Service News which issued in December 2012 to most forest owners in receipt of premium payments.  There is also a dedicated webpage on Ash Dieback on my Department&rsquo;s website which contains Press Releases and presentations about Chalara.</p><p>My Department contributes towards the annual programme of forestry promotional and advisory activities undertaken by the Forestry Development Department of Teagasc.  As part of its activities in 2013, Teagasc organised, with support from my Department, 22 information meetings on Chalara which took place in late May 2013.Some 800 people attended and information was provided on what to look out for and the implications in terms of clearance of a forest plantation.  Clarification was also given at these meetings on the implications for AEOS and REPS farmers where the disease is found on the trees planted under these schemes.  My Department also arranged for the printing and distribution of posters showing the general public the symptoms that they should watch out for and whom they should notify about such symptoms.  My Department also arranged for a full page advertisement about Chalara to appear in the programme for the All-Ireland Hurling Final in September 2013 and 2014.</p><p>It is very difficult to quantify exactly how much the Department itself spent on distributing information on Chalara as many of these activities were undertaken jointly as part of an existing budget allocation or in many other cases there were no direct costs charged to the Department. </p></reply>

The legislation controls the importation and movement of ash seeds, plants and wood.  Imports are monitored at ports of entry.  Imports from several non EU countries require a documentary, identity and plant health inspection before entry into Ireland.  In addition ash is currently de-listed as an approved species under the Department&rsquo;s afforestation schemes.  Ash is also not approved for planting under the new Agri-environmental scheme GLAS.  Planting of ash is also not permitted for National Roads Authority roadside plantings.  These measures have substantially reduced the demand for ash for planting.

REPS 4 is a measure under the 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue. During the course of an on-farm Inspection in 2014 discrepancies between the Single Farm Payment application for 2014 and the REPS agri-environment Plan were discovered which required further investigation.  This has now been completed and amendments to SPS parcel boundary maps are waiting to be finalised. Once this ha s been completed the REPS 2014 payment will be processed.</p></reply>

In some instances where the volume of appeals submitted is extremely high, it is necessary to provide for an alternative appeals mechanism to process these in an efficient manner.  This was the case in respect of appeals submitted under the 2013 LPIS Review. I, therefore, established the Independent LPIS Appeals Committee to deal with such appeals. This Committee comprises of an independent Chairman and Appeals Offices from the Agriculture Appeals Office . The Schedule to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 was amended by the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 (Amendment of Schedule) Regulations 2013 (SI No. 10 of 2013) to exclude the Land Parcel Identification System Review 2013 (LPIS Review 2013) cases.  Where persons were dissatisfied with a decision affecting them under the 2013 Review of Eligibility of Land parcels, they were entitled in the first instance, to have the decision reviewed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. However, if applicants were not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they could appeal that decision to the LPIS Appeals Committee. If they continued to be dissatisfied after the Appeals Committee had reviewed their case, they can refer the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of the Appeals Committee is available on the website of the Agriculture Appeals Office. Each appeal case is decided on its own individual merits and an individual recommendation issues from the Committee to my Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. There are no plans to publish individual recommendations but, however, overall statistics will be included in the Agriculture Appeals Office Annual Report, which will be published later this year.</p></reply>

In general, inspections of commonage land are undertaken as part of the annual round of eligibility inspections of the lands declared, including commonages, by applicants under direct Payment Schemes or as part of a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) Review. If it forms part of an eligibility inspection, the applicant involved is informed of the inspection in the normal manner. Such inspections are carried out on the entire farm including any commonage areas declared.  A LPIS Review involves the assessment of the latest ortho-imagery available of land s parcels, on the Land Parcel Identification System, which are declared by farmers in their applications for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes. The objective of the assessment is to identify and exclude any ineligible areas or features from the land parcels declared by farmers in their applications for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes. The assessment is normally undertaken using the latest ortho-imagery available only but in some instances it is necessary to carry-out a follow-up verification visit on the ground to confirm the findings of the assessment. Such verification visits may relate to one or more parcels on a farm, irrespective of whether or not commonage land has been declared but are not generally carried out on the entire farm. The applicants are not notified of these verification visits but are notified of the findings of the verification checks.</p></reply>

I am inviting submissions on that draft Programme by 1 May 2015.    The draft Seafood Development Programme 2014-2020 proposes investment of &euro;30 million in a number of measures specifically intended to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector. One of these measures relates to aquaculture stock insurance and would be implemented under article 57 of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation (508/2014). In framing that Regulation, the EU co-legislators stated in recital 54 that &ldquo;recognising the risk of investments in aquaculture activities, it should be possible for the EMFF to promote business security by contributing to aquaculture stock insurance, thereby safeguarding the income of producers in case of abnormal production losses due, in particular, to natural disasters, adverse climatic events, sudden water quality changes, diseases or pest infestations and the destruction of production facilities.&rdquo;. In the draft Programme, it is proposed that this measure would supplement and complement commercial insurance arrangements, not replace them. I am interested to hear the views of stakeholders on this particular measure, and I will be considering carefully any submissions received. </p>  <p>  In relation to State Aid, article 8(2) of the EMFF Regulation provides that payments made by Member States pursuant to, and in conformity with, the Regulation shall comply with State Aid rules.   </p></reply>

This resulted in reductions of 1.40 hectares being applied to the area based payments due to the person named. The reductions were for ineligible features including buildings, areas of scrub, a farm road and a stream, which were included in the claimed area of the person named and resulted in a reduction between 3% and 20% to the area payable under all his 2013 area-based Schemes.  The person named was notified of this over-declaration by letter of 12 June 2014 which also advised that if the number of hectares of eligible land found was insufficient to meet the number of his Single Payment entitlements, his Single Payment would be reduced accordingly. This letter also advised the person named that any reduction in his claimed area and/or the application of a penalty under the Single Payment Scheme may also have implications for other area based schemes for which he is an applicant such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS), Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), Grassland Sheep Scheme (GSS), etc.   </p>  <p>  Resultant from the over-declaration, over-payments were established under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme and 2013 Disadvantaged Area Scheme. The same levels of reductions were also applied to the 2014 Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme applications submitted by the person named. The person named was advised of same on 21 October 2014 and 23 October 2014 respectively. </p>  <p>Following a review of the case further to correspondence from the person named on 25 September 2014 and 21 October 2014, my Department decided to carry out a ground verification check on the areas declared by the applicant. This verification visit was completed on 15 January 2015.   </p>  <p>The person named was advised of the outcome of this verification visit, in writing, on 11 February 2015. The letter also advised that if the person named was not satisfied with the outcome of the review, he may submit a further appeal to the Independent LPIS Appeals Committee. The person named availed of this right on 18 February 2015 and his case will be reviewed by the Committee in the near future. This position was confirmed to the person named by an officer of my Department during a recent phone conversation. </p>  <p>  Full AEOS payments for 2013 and 2014 have been made, less appropriate penalties. If the results of the above review make a material difference to the AEOS payments already made, then appropriate balancing measures will be taken as soon as possible after those decision are finalised. </p></reply>

The aim of this initiative was to create 250 cross sectoral jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014. Seafood processing was just one of the areas identified as having the potential to create additional employment. I am informed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that by the end of 2014, 89 jobs had been created in seafood processing companies in the Killybegs area. At this time, I do not have information available to me on jobs created in areas outside of my area of responsibility.  The seafood sector continues to be a high-growth area of the economy and indeed of our food industry. Exports have grown 70% since 2009 and the sector is now worth &euro;850 million in sales. Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Bia are working with seafood companies in Killybegs and elsewhere around our coast to grow the sector to &euro;1 billion in the next few years. This will be driven by our seafood processing sector adding value to commodity products, innovating and developing new consumer seafood products, with the assistance of BIM&rsquo;s Seafood Development Centres in Clonakilty and Killybegs, and winning new markets in Europe and the Far-East for Ireland&rsquo;s top quality seafood. Just last month I announced financial support for two more capital investment projects by Killybegs seafood companies. On 9 May last year, I attended an information launch by Biomarine Ingredients Ireland of their plans to build the largest marine food ingredients plant in the world in Killybegs and I understand that plans for that are progressing well. It is clear that the future is very promising for the seafood industry generally and Killybegs is central to that growth story. While the Killybegs Jobs Initiative was important in terms of fostering a diversified blue economy in Killybegs, seafood will continue to be the driver of economic growth for Killybegs in the years to come.   </p></reply>

Where the licence is not produced in court this fact is not updated to the Courts Service computer system.</p><p>The Courts Service currently has no plans to modify or enhance the computer system to record non production of a licence.  In the context of enforcement of road traffic legislation, I am informed that all available ICT resources are currently deployed in modifying and enhancing their computer system to facilitate the implementation of the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014.  Additionally, the Courts Service recently commenced work in association with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enhance the computer system to facilitate the introduction of the 3rd payment option provided for in Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  I also understand that detailed consideration of arrangements to facilitate the Garda&iacute; in the bringing of prosecutions for non-production of driver licences in court is at an advanced stage.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 4,400 asylum seekers in 34 centres around the State.</p><p>Last year, the Government set up an independent working group to report to it on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. It is chaired by former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society. The working group developed a work programme early on and established three sub-groups to deal with the following themes. The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims. Over 40 meetings at plenary and sub-group level have taken place since the first meeting of the working group on 11 November 2014.</p><p>The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents. It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBTI community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon. The Government recognises that the issues to be examined by the working group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies.</p><p>The Chairman has indicated that the Working Group will be in a position to finalise its report before the end of May 2015<b></b>after which the Government will then consider the recommendations made therein.</p></reply>

Such decisions take into account the potential for abuse and the extent to which the particular substance is or can be legitimately used for medical or scientific purposes.The question of whether provision should be made for the use of cannabis for pain relief is therefore one which falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Health Leo Varadkar T.D. </p><p>However, I am advised by the Health authorities that prior to last July any use of the substance in all forms was prohibited in Ireland. On 11 July 2014 the then Minister of State for Primary Care at the Department of Health Alex White T.D. signed regulations which enables authorised cannabis-based medicinal products to be legally prescribed by medical practitioners and used by patients. </p><p>I am further informed that on 18 July 2014 the Health Products Regulatory Authority granted a marketing authorisation for the cannabis based medicinal product Sativex&reg; to be marketed in Ireland and that making the product available for prescribing in Ireland is now a matter for the holder of the product authorisation, GW Pharmaceuticals PLC and its European partner Almirall.</p><p>The Health authorities have also advised that the question of whether the product should be made available under the HSE's Community Drugs Schemes High Tech Arrangement is currently the subject of discussions between the HSE and the supplier.</p><p>With regard to the issue raised by the Deputy concerning the particular penalties imposed by the Courts in dealing with an offence involving cannabis possession under the Misuse of Drugs legislation, the position is that the Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.

Work on the development and implementation of  these strategies are underway and are being implemented over the lifetime of the Strategic Plan. </p><p>The progress report on year 2 of the implementation plan of this strategy will form part of the soon to be published Irish Prison Service Annual Report for 2014. I will furnish the Deputy with a copy of this report which will be published shortly.</p><p>In relation to the strategy for young offenders, the Deputy will be aware the Government is committed to ending the practice of sending children to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. Significant progress has been made by my own Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in fulfilling that commitment.  Responsibility for 16 year old boys was transferred from the Irish Prison Service to the children detention facilities at Oberstown in May 2012.  Since December 2013, all boys aged 17 years sentenced to detention in St. Patrick&rsquo;s have been transferred to dedicated units in Wheatfield Place of Detention.  Boys aged 17 remanded  in custody to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution remain the responsibility of the Irish Prison Service pending the completion of the building project at the children detention facilities at Oberstown and the preparation of the necessary legal instruments to transfer responsibility for this category of offender to Oberstown. The Oberstown campus commenced taking 17 year old males who are newly remanded in custody since Monday 30 March 2015. This is a further step towards the implementation of the Programme for Government commitment to end the detention of children in adult prison facilities.  </p><p>Further work carried out for young offenders includes: facilitating Red Cross training in Wheatfield Place of Detention, focusing on rehabilitative resettlement of young offenders under supervision and delivering victim empathy group programmes in both Wheatfield and the children detention school. </p><p>On 6 March 2014 the IPS published a Women&rsquo;s Strategy entitled &quot;An Effective Response to Women Who Offend&quot;. The Women&rsquo;s Strategy  sets out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service work together, as well as with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, to provide women-focused interventions to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally. This co-operative approach is a direct result of the Joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service Female Strategy 2014-2016 which aims to deliver more effective offender management.<b></b>In addressing the needs of women offenders the IPS have also:</p><p>-  worked with a range of agencies including the Dublin Regional Housing Executive, Dublin City Council, HSE, DCETB to open the Abigail centre which is run by DePaul Ireland and Novas Ireland. The centre provides supported accommodation and a wide variety of services for women.</p><p>-  Initiated collaboration with INSPIRE women's project in Northern Ireland with a joint visit by the PS and IPS staff.</p><p>-  Pursued tailored placements for women on community service and community return.</p><p>-  completed audit of inreach services in the Dochas Prison and Limerick Women's Prison.</p><p>In relation to prisoners on protection the strategy commits the Prison Service to introducing appropriate assessment procedures to inform their prisoner placement policy to ensure that prisoners are accommodated appropriate to their security status. The roll-out of the various assessment tools is well under way.It is at the committal stage that the majority of prisoners are identified as being in need of protection. In many instances, the prisoner will identify himself as being in need of same and in other instances, either intelligence or the assessment of the governor will identify a prisoner as requiring protection.  Efforts are made on a continuous basis to reduce the numbers of protection prisoners, there is a significant reduction in the number of protection prisoners and improved out of cell time.  Since the commencement of the census in July 2013, the number of prisoners on 22/23 hour lock up has decreased by 154 or 74% from 211 to 57% <font color="#004080"> </font>( Figures taken from January 2015 Census).  </p><p>In the context of older persons in prison, in line with the Three Year Strategic Plan, the Irish Prison Service is seeking to identify the care needs of persons 55 years of age and above with a view to putting in place care plans to address those needs. Development of a Prison policy specifically focusing on the care and management of older prisoners - strategic links and interventions is ongoing to strengthen integration, cooperation and support in collaboration with community services to ensure seamless transition on release, in addition to improving the quality of life of this cohort of prisoners while in custody. The survey of older prisoners was completed in 2014 and a review of the survey results is currently under consideration and appropriate actions within resources to be implemented in 2015.</p><p>Discussions and proposals of the joint IPS/Probation Service working group, in relation to achieving an effective and managed response to imprisoned sex offenders, are under active consideration in partnership with my Department. .</p></reply>

A total of 24 dedicated ISM Coordinators are now operational in all prisons and open centres. The allocation of dedicated staff in each establishment greatly enhances the effectiveness of the sentence management system and facilitates the growing numbers of prisoners participating in the process. To enhance consistency of delivery across the prison estate a dedicated ISM Coordinator training course was delivered in the IPS College in 2014.</p><p>Newly committed prisoners with a sentence of greater than one year are eligible to take part in Integrated Sentence Management (ISM). This involves a specific orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result is a prisoner-centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress. </p><p>Following committal the ISM Coordinator conducts a First Contact Assessment. This First Contact Assessment identifies the needs of the prisoner in several areas such as accommodation, education and offending behaviour.  Referrals are made on foot of this assessment to services within the prison such as Education, Work/Training and outside agencies providing an in-reach service. The various actions recommended by these services are compiled into a Personal Integration Plan (PIP).  This is a plan of actions for the prisoner to complete during his/her time in prison. The PIP will be reviewed regularly depending on the length of the sentence.  Approximately 9 months prior to the release of the prisoner, a Community Integration Plan (CIP) will be developed.  This sets out a plan for the prisoner to prepare for his/her release.  Important issues such as accommodation, employment or education are addressed to help the prisoner resettle into the community on release and reduce the risk of re-offending.</p><p>The ISM process has played a key role in the success of the Community Return Scheme. ISM Coordinators are also active participants in sentence planning for certain categories of prisoners serving less than one year, for example, female prisoners, prisoners at risk of homelessness on release, or prisoners participating in the Community Support Scheme.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that significant staff consultation took place through the holding of 19 focus groups across the Prison Estate. Resulting from these consultations five behaviours were identified by staff as necessary to ensure a dignified work environment. These are Respectful, Supportive, Openness, Competence, Fair &amp;amp; Inclusive behaviours. These principles will be at the heart of what the Irish Prison Service sets out to achieve in the coming years and into the future in all strategic actions.  </p>  <p>  Five sub groups were then established to develop policies and initiatives  to bring about a working environment displaying these behaviours.   I am advised that a number of policies have been drafted including Acceptable Behaviour Standard, Anti Graffiti Policy, Competency Framework, Well-Being at Work Policy placing the foundations to the programme.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the strategic importance of a positive and inclusive work environment the Director General commissioned an Independent Interim Report on the programme which was published last month and is fully committed to the delivery of this programme.</p>  <p>  A number of issues have arisen in respect of the Dignity at Work Programme in recent months and I am advised by the Irish Prison Management that they have at all times continued to engage constantly with the Prison Officers Association on these issues.</p>  <p>  In this context the overall objective must remain a working environment which is based on  co-operation, openness, equality and respect.</p></reply>

The Bill will introduce new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services which are directed at the demand side of prostitution with a view to tackling the exploitation, including trafficking in persons, associated with prostitution.  The General Scheme also contains wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and other vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  The Bill will also implement the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas Committees, reform the law on incest and update the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  Addressing these sensitive issues makes this a complex piece of legislation.  It is currently being drafted, with a view to publication in this parliamentary session. </p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy of existing laws in the area of prostitution.  Under section 6 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  It is also an offence under the 1993 Act to organise prostitution, to knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute or to keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, public order legislation prohibits the advertising of brothels and prostitution.  I am satisfied that these provisions are adequate to address any impacts to this State arising from upcoming reforms in other jurisdictions. </p></reply>

In this context, I am committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure. </p><p>In July 2013, a Working Group, chaired by Prof. Brian MacCraith, President, Dublin City University, was established to carry out the Strategic Review. The Working Group was tasked with examining and making high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to:</p><p>-  Improving graduate retention in the public health system;</p><p>-  Planning for future service needs;</p><p>-  Realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.</p><p>The Working Group completed its work in mid-2014 and, in all, submitted three reports and made 25 recommendations. The reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system. </p><p>The Strategic Review recommendations are being implemented through a range of structures and processes across the health system. Each recommendation has an identified business owner and progress updates are sought by my Department on a regular basis.To support implementation of the recommendations, my Department has also established an Implementation Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders including trainee doctors. This approach will help drive implementation across the system and embed the recommendations in the day-to-day business practice of the health system. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the first six-monthly progress report on the implementation of the recommendations was published on 5th March last on my Department&rsquo;s website. The next report will be finalised and published this summer so that all stakeholders, in particular trainee doctors, can assess the progress being made across the range of Strategic Review recommendations.</p></reply>

There is no entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition.  The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014.  Key findings of the Expert Panel were that it would not be feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility and that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  Following publication of the two reports, in November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p><p>The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner.  The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by 60% from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 83,000 at the end of March this year.</p><p>With regard to the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme, there are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that, under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals not holding a medical card, a GP visit card or not covered under the LTI scheme who  incur ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p></reply>

The additional eligible population is approximately 100,000 and, when fully implemented, 540,000 women will be included in the BreastCheck Programme.</p>  <p>  The age extension will be implemented on an incremental basis in line with the capacity of the system to manage the additional screening and follow up workload.  BreastCheck will need to recruit and train additional radiographers, medical consultants and administration support to accommodate the increased demand.  Funding for this, and for additional mobile units and medical equipment will be made available across the implementation period.  The age extension will be fully rolled out by 2021.</p>  <p>  Women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated cancer centres.</p></reply>

Of these, 2,710 were general practitioners. EU data includes trainee specialists and these cannot be separated out, so it is not possible to provide a valid comparison with other EU member states.</p>  <p>  The latest comparative data on the ratio of acute beds in EU member states is for 2012 according to the OECD.  The number of curative (acute) care beds per 1,000 population in Ireland in 2012 is 2.1.  This compares to an EU average (based on the 19 states where data was available) of 3.5.  It should be noted that Irish data does not currently include beds in private hospitals, whereas these beds may be included in data from other member states.</p>  <p>  The HSE's National Service Plan 2015 provides overall funding of the order of &euro;3,211.8 million for primary care.  This includes &euro;2,485.8 million for the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, including Local Schemes.

If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up the matter with them.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may recall, on 3 February 2015, the Government approved the General Scheme of a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption to the OECD average by 2020 (i.e. 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita) and the harms caused by alcohol.  The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed by the Government in 2013 on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  The other measures (eg for the HSE, professional bodies etc) set out in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant departments and organisations.  The HSE has responsibility for implementing a number of recommendations and some of these measures are reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2015.  The remit of the Drugs Task Forces was extended to include the problem of alcohol misuse last year, in view of the key they play in co-ordinating the response to substance misuse at local level.</p></reply>

Since that time the majority of the recommendations made in the report have been addressed and implemented.  In relation to the recommendation regarding a no fault vaccine damage compensation scheme my Department convened an expert group to examine this issue.  The report from this Group is available on my Department's website (www.health.gov.ie).  There are no plans to introduce a vaccine damage compensation scheme at this time.</p>  <p>  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee which indicated that the vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.</p>  <p>  The manufacturer of the HPV vaccine used in the immunisation programme in Ireland has not been indemnified against criminal prosecution.</p></reply>

In addition to the European approval, it is currently authorised for use in 133 countries worldwide, including approvals by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Therapeutic Good Administration in Australia. It is estimated that over 165 million doses of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>have been distributed worldwide since it was first authorised (figures to end of May 2014). Figures on national distribution and usage are available from the HSE.</p><p>Since first authorisation the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>. This monitoring includes review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.</p><p>Up to 20 April 2015, the HPRA has received 849 reports of adverse reactions associated with Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>. The vast majority of these reports relate to adolescents, with a smaller number occurring in adults &amp;gt;18 years of age, which is reflective of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>usage as part of the national HPV immunisation programme. No new risks have been identified in association with national use of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>. The national monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccine, as outlined in the product information, including injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions (including urticaria). Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope were among the most commonly reported reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported including a small number of anaphylactic-type reactions in patients, who have recovered following intervention and treatment.  It is estimated that over 590,000 doses of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>have been distributed in Ireland to date since the commencement of the HPV schools immunisation programme.</p></reply>

The level of fluoride in drinking water in Ireland has been set at between 0.6-0.8 parts per million. This level of fluoride is deemed optimal for protecting the oral health of all age groups. European Council Directive 98/83 allows for a maximum permitted concentration of fluoride in drinking water up to 1.5mg/litre (or parts per million), almost twice the maximum level permitted in Ireland. In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department. This review is currently being finalised.</p></reply>

Under the proposed legislation commercial surrogacy will be prohibited, however, the reimbursement of reasonable expenses for surrogates will be permitted. In addition, the proposed legislation will take cognisance of the 2014 Supreme Court judgment in the <i>MR &amp;amp; Anor v An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors</i>(surrogacy) case, which found that the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is the legal mother of twins born via surrogacy and should be registered as such on the birth certificates.</p><p>Following the completion of the draft General Scheme, I intend to submit the Scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny.

While I would favour public funding of fertility treatments in principle there are many other pressing funding demands on the health service at this time.</p>  <p>  Although in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment is not provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE). Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

These centres accept all ambulance transfers of patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).  The provision of PPCI  from three 24/7 centres in Dublin had proved unsustainable and the decision to consolidate the service into two centres was made following a comprehensive review and reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on smaller number of sites, to allow for the concentration of volume and expertise.    </p>  <p>  In November 2014, the Acute Hospitals Division of the HSE requested the National Clinical Programme for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS Programme) to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The model of care produced by the ACS Programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  The Programme was also informed by models of care from the US and Australia.   Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24/7 requirements of this service.</p>  <p>  The review looked at the number of centres that should be delivering PPCI in Dublin, where these centres should be located and the feasibility of maintaining 9 to 5 PPCI services on any cardiology intervention site.  Following consultation with the National Ambulance Service and with all relevant hospitals, the ACS Programme recommended that there should be two 24/7 PPCI centres for Dublin, located in the Mater and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, which would accept all ambulance transfers of patients with STEMI.  </p>  <p>  The ACS Programme also recommended that there should be a clear definition of the role of the three other cardiology intervention centres in Dublin (Beaumont Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital  in the management of Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).  NSTEMI forms an increasing proportion of interventional work which will continue and develop in those cardiology intervention centres which will not be designated 24/7 PPCI centres, including St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital. </p></reply>

I am aware also of the accompanying Executive Order signed by President Obama which provides the legal basis for the sanctions.This matter has, clearly, given rise to diplomatic tensions between the United States and Venezuela. I am pleased to note, in this regard, that the US has since indicated that the measures in question have not been invoked against the Venezuelan people as a whole, only against the named individuals. Official sources have clarified that the US does not consider Venezuela to be a threat to its national security. I am pleased also that the matter was discussed between President Obama and President Maduro at the recent Summit of the Americas held in Panama on 10 April in what was described as a candid, serious and frank manner.I am following the situation in Venezuela closely and with great concern. Increasing internal tensions, political polarisation, and a severe economic crisis have led to serious shortages in medical supplies and daily goods. I fear that a severe humanitarian crisis may develop if the situation is not resolved soon. </p><p>As I have indicated before, the deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest in Venezuela require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process. The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes is a matter of further concern.</p><p>I share the view expressed by EU High Representative Mogherini, and by Venezuela&rsquo;s regional partners, that the government there must work with all parties and with civil society to overcome the difficult situation in the country. I encourage all sides to enter into inclusive and open negotiations to meet the legitimate concerns of the people of Venezuela.</p><p>I remain of the view that the best hope for progress is an inclusive dialogue to address the challenges facing the country, fully respecting the democratic rights of people on all sides.</p></reply>

That is why the Government has encouraged all parties to stand back and consider the overall potential benefit for the people of Northern Ireland offered by the Stormont House Agreement and to ensure that this potential is fully achieved.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Government was not a party to the negotiations late last year in Stormont Castle or Stormont House which dealt specifically with budgets and financial issues.  Recent and ongoing discussions on these matters take place primarily between the Northern Ireland Executive Party leaders themselves.  For that reason, I have called on the Northern Ireland parties, and in particular Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, to work together to find a solution to the current difficulties on welfare.  I know that work is ongoing by Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political leaders to resolve the welfare issue, and I understand that some progress has been made. </p>  <p>  I have stayed in close contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with Northern Ireland's party leaders on this matter.  I met with them most recently at the second implementation and review meeting of the Stormont House Agreement in Belfast on 27 March.  The Taoiseach also met with the First Minister and deputy First Minister during his visit to Belfast on the previous day. </p>  <p>   In all contacts I have underlined that the success of the Agreement is contingent on the faithful implementation of the totality of its provisions.  Our collective objective must be to build on the good work that has already been done towards the Agreement's implementation and to maintain forward momentum.</p></reply>

The work of implementing the Agreement continues at political and official level.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the review and monitoring provisions of the Stormont House Agreement, quarterly review meetings are held involving the Northern Ireland Executive party leaders and the British and Irish Governments.     </p>  <p>  The second such meeting took place in Belfast on 27 March at which I represented the Government.  The meeting reviewed progress made to date on the detailed implementation timeline for the Stormont House Agreement, which was agreed by the NI Executive party leaders and the two Governments at the first review meeting of 30 January.  </p>  <p>  On 11 February, I met with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers during her visit to Dublin.  We discussed a broad range of issues including the next steps in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. </p>  <p>  On 25 February, I represented the Government, together with Minister of State Se&aacute;n Sherlock, at the North South Ministerial Council meeting in institutional format.  Both First Minister Peter Robinson and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness represented the Northern Ireland Executive.  We considered a report on possible new sectoral priorities for North/South cooperation, as provided for under the Stormont House Agreement. </p>  <p>  The next Stormont House Agreement review meeting is scheduled to take place in June.  A six-monthly update on progress on implementation of the Agreement is due to be published at that time, in accordance with the review and monitoring provisions of the Agreement.   </p>  <p>  The Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a number of new mechanisms to address the legacy of the past including an independent Historical Investigations Unit, an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, an Oral History Archive and an Implementation and Reconciliation Group to oversee themes, archives and information recovery across the framework for dealing with the legacy of the past. </p>  <p>  Primary legislation to establish the Historical Investigations Unit will be taken forward at Westminster and I understand that the intention is to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to enable the Unit to be established in 2016. </p>  <p>  The Government has committed to putting all necessary arrangements in place, including legislation where necessary, to support the new framework on the past.

Such statements are particularly regrettable in the tense and inflammatory situation in the Middle East.  We know from our own peace process how words of supposed comfort to one side can have disproportionately negative impacts on the other side.  </p>  <p>  I note that Mr. Netanyahu subsequently stated that his remarks meant only that conditions at present are not conducive to the achievement of a two state solution.</p>  <p>  For its part, the international community has quickly reaffirmed its conviction that the two state solution remains the only viable basis for a resolution of the conflict.  High Representative Mogherini on behalf of the EU, President Obama, and others, have made that point directly to Mr. Netanyahu in the course of conversations following the election. </p>  <p>  What is most important is how the new government in Israel, which we expect Mr. Netanyahu to form, actually acts and what is set out in its Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  All of our actions and policies at EU and international level are designed to advance the goal of peace and secure a comprehensive peace agreement at the earliest opportunity."</p></reply>

These are the Permanent Council and the Forum for Security Co-Operation, both of which are accountable to the Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  While complementary to the work of these Vienna-based OSCE bodies, the Parliamentary Assembly is distinct in that its aim is to facilitate inter-parliamentary dialogue outside of the intergovernmental process.  As such, the Assembly has its own rules and procedures, and any review of functions and operations would be for the members of the Parliamentary Assembly to decide.  </p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the valuable contribution that the Parliamentary Assembly makes to the OSCE&rsquo;s overall goal of promoting peace and stability throughout Europe, and I encourage closer cooperation to this end.  In particular, I value the Parliamentary Assembly's contribution to the 'Helsinki+40' reform effort that was launched by my predecessor, the then T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore as Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE in 2012.  'Helsinki +40' is a three year reform process that provides an opportunity to critically examine the OSCE's roles, structures, tools and instruments with a view to making them better suited to the peace and security challenges of the 21st Century in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian region.  The Government welcomes the active engagement of the Parliamentary Assembly in this process.</p>  <p>  Parliamentarians are well positioned to ensure the involvement of citizens in developing peace and security and in raising awareness of the work of the OSCE.  They serve as a vital link between the overall work of the OSCE and the people it intends to serve.  I would hope that strengthening this area of activity will be among the recommendations to emerge from the reform discussions.</p></reply>

Firstly to see this individual released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland, and secondly to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by me and my officials in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests.</p><p>It is important to bear in mind the role of the Irish Government where citizens are imprisoned abroad.  Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  The decision to release this individual either on bail or on any other basis, will be a decision that is made solely by the Egyptian authorities.</p><p>Since this citizen was originally detained in August 2013, I, and officials in my Department including our Embassy in Cairo, have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities regularly and consistently.  In addition, he has received consular visits from Embassy officials on 37 occasions.  I can confirm that the Irish Government has formally supported both the application by this citizen's lawyers for his release and return to Ireland under the November Presidential decree, and the more recent application for his release on bail.  Our official support for this citizen's release has been duly communicated to the Egyptian authorities in formal diplomatic notes that have been included in the documentation submitted to the court and the authorities by his lawyer.</p><p>I have also spoken to my Egyptian counterpart on numerous occasions, both in person and on the telephone.  On 4 March I met with Assistant Foreign Minister Hisham Badr and discussed the case with him in some detail.  <i>On 2 April I spoke again with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Shoukry to underline the Government's support for the formal applications that have been made for this individual's release &ndash; both for the formal application for bail, and for the application that has been made for release under the Presidential decree on foreign prisoners. I  also took the opportunity to highlight key humanitarian concerns &ndash; including this individual's youth, his absence from his studies and the length of time in detention without conviction. </i></p><p>The individual's trial has started, with the next hearing scheduled for 26 April.  All of the information we have received indicates that it is highly unlikely that there will be any decision as regards his release until the court makes its decisions.  We continue to review our approach and actions in this case, but we are guided at all times by the two key objectives set out above.  Given that the trial has now commenced and a formal petition for his release on bail is currently being considered by the Egyptian courts, my Department must exercise restraint in its public comment.  This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases, in line with our clear objectives in this case and what we firmly believe to be in this citizen's best interests and to be most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him. </p><p>We remain in ongoing contact with this individual and his family, and will continue to offer full consular support.</p></reply>

The policy has been implemented on a gradual basis over the intervening years.  The precise model for implementing such an arrangement would, of course, vary and have to reflect local conditions and other factors.  In all cases, the arrangement is one designed to increase the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s presence abroad, to improve coordination among all parties, and to maximise cost-efficiencies. </p>  <p>  There are a number of types of Ireland House which include our diplomatic and consular missions abroad and the offices of state agencies operating from the same premises.  These are currently operating in 19 locations overseas.  The largest is in New York and comprises the Consulate General, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in addition to other agencies including Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia, the American Ireland Fund and CIE Tours.    </p>  <p>  Missions at Boston, Brussels, Budapest, Prague, Riyadh and Warsaw share premises with Enterprise Ireland.  Our missions at Austin, Moscow, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo accommodate both Enterprise Ireland and IDA offices.  The Consulate General in Shanghai shares premises with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, and also Bord Bia and an agent for Tourism Ireland; the Ireland House in Madrid includes offices of Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland, together with the Embassy.  Other configurations prevail elsewhere, including at Embassy Beijing, which shares premises with the IDA; Embassies Stockholm and New Delhi share space with Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia; and Ireland&rsquo;s Consulate General in Atlanta operates from the same location as the IDA.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number of other locations where state agencies share facilities with each other in the form of an Ireland House, which does not include the Irish diplomatic mission to that particular country.  For example, in Paris, the IDA, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and BIM operate an Ireland House.</p>  <p>  The Ireland House concept has been implemented where practicable and further opportunities are considered whenever missions or agencies are opening or moving to new locations.  I can confirm that the scope for further implementation of the Ireland House concept is being actively pursued in the context of the current expansion of the diplomatic network, not only in relation to Austin, Texas, mentioned above, but at other locations as well.</p></reply>

The new sustainable development agenda should be adopted at a major UN summit of world leaders in New York in September.  It will involve a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which will complete the work of the MDGs on the eradication of extreme poverty and will also put sustainable development at the core.  The SDGs will be universal in nature and address development challenges through social, environmental and economic actions in low, middle and high-income countries alike.  They will address a wide range of areas including MDG priorities such as food and nutrition, but also broader challenges, including on climate, sustainable production and consumption, and peace and governance.</p>  <p>  Ireland has taken a leading role in shaping the post-2015 Development agenda having facilitated EU discussions and Council Conclusions during our EU Presidency in 2013, and co-facilitated the Special Event on the MDGs at the UN in September 2013.  In the drafting of Goals and Targets for the new agenda, Ireland worked in a team with Denmark and Norway in the Open Working Group at the UN, where we set out our key priorities for the global development agenda up to 2030.  These included the fight to end hunger and undernutrition, gender equality and women's empowerment, and good governance and rule of law.  We have advocated for strong goals and targets in each of these key areas, and we have emphasised the need to incorporate human rights in the new development framework, reduce global inequality and protect the role of civil society.   </p>  <p>  Ireland's positions in the UN negotiations are agreed through a whole-of-Government coordination process involving all relevant Government Departments.  We are working with our EU partners to ensure that the process will culminate in a successful outcome in September and that the new SDGs, which will have a profound impact on the lives of the world&rsquo;s poor, will reflect our priorities and galvanise action to end extreme poverty and hunger by 2030. </p>  <p>  This year will also see major international conferences on the financing of the SDGs in Addis Ababa from the 13-16 July and on a new agreement on Climate Change in Paris in December.  The second session of negotiations on the Financing for Development process took place from 13 to 17 April, in New York, and the fourth session of the intergovernmental negotiations on post-2015 will be from 20 to 24 of April.</p></reply>

That said, it is clear that much remains to be done by Member States to support investment, growth and job creation and to ensure that the current recovery is truly sustainable.   </p>  <p>  This has been and will continue to be the key focus of the Government, both nationally and working with our EU colleagues in the Member States and the institutions.  </p>  <p>  President Jean-Claude Juncker has highlighted as his key tasks the need to rebuild bridges in Europe after the crisis; to restore European citizens' confidence; to focus the Union's policies on the key challenges ahead for our economies and for our societies, and to strengthen democratic legitimacy on the basis of the Community method.  These are goals which we fully share and support. </p>  <p>  Here at home, the Government is committed to developing and increasing public understanding and knowledge about our membership of the EU and its benefits.  This includes targeted spending on EU engagement, including support for the activities of local community groups and non-governmental organisations through the Communicating Europe Initiative.  We also work closely with the European Commission Representation and the European Parliament Information Office in Dublin to improve communications on EU issues in Ireland and to promote greater understanding of the EU.</p>  <p>  It is also noteworthy that, notwithstanding the very difficult circumstances in which last year's European parliament elections were held, a substantial majority of the electorate supported pro-EU parties and candidates.</p></reply>

EU Heads of State and Government have agreed that any decisions in relation to EU sanctions should be linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements.</p>  <p>  The OSCE has reported an improvement in the overall security situation in Ukraine since the peace deal was agreed in Minsk.  However, I am very concerned at reports of an increase in violations of the ceasefire in recent days.  This was discussed by the Foreign Ministers of Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia at a meeting in Berlin last week.  The Ministers called on all sides to stop the fighting, demonstrate their commitment to fully implement the ceasefire and complete the withdrawal of heavy weapons.    </p>  <p>  It is important that these calls are heeded so that progress can be achieved on other key elements of the Minsk peace deal.  It is also imperative that the OSCE Mission is given complete and unfettered access to all parts of the conflict zone in order to be able to verify the full extent of heavy weapons withdrawal.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that the situation remains fragile and we will continue to monitor developments on the ground.

These targets were revised in the Review of Government Trade Strategy, published in February 2014, which included the addition of a numerical target in international education.  The implementation of these targets is monitored by the Export Trade Council, which I chair. </p>  <p>  The numerical targets are, for the most part, not industry-specific.  However we work in close cooperation with the relevant Departments and State agencies responsible for all industry sectors. </p>  <p>  In terms of overall exports, including in the IT and pharmaceutical sectors, we continue to work closely with Enterprise Ireland, particularly through the organisation and coordination of the annual Enterprise Ireland programme of Ministerial-led trade missions and events.  Early each year I agree the annual programme with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, based on the proposals submitted by Enterprise Ireland and focused on the priority markets of interest to their client companies.</p>  <p>  In the case of the agri-food industry, we cooperate closely with Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in promoting the Irish food and beverage sector internationally.  With the active engagement of our Embassy network, we have had a number of recent high-level successes.  A notable example includes Ireland becoming in 2015 the only European country to have access to both the US and the Chinese beef markets.</p>  <p>  With regard to developing new markets for Irish products, while the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US, and we must continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is also strongly focused on the further development of trading partnerships with other important emerging markets.</p>  <p>  As part of the review of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, seven additional high potential and exploratory markets were identified to increase our engagement with high growth markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. </p>  <p>  Following the Review, eight new Embassies and Consulates were opened in the past year to take advantage of emerging opportunities in important markets and to complement the existing trade promotion work of our Embassy network. </p>  <p>  The Embassy network plays a crucial role in proactively addressing market access issues, supporting Irish businesses seeking to grow overseas, holding promotional events for, and in association with, State agencies, as well as actively contributing to the organisation and conduct of Ministerial-led trade missions and events overseas.</p></reply>

Ireland's response is underpinned by a strong commitment to international humanitarian law and the provision of aid that is based on the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality, impartiality and humanity.The international community is currently challenged by an unprecedented scale of humanitarian need globally, driven by conflict, chronic instability and economic and environmental shocks.  Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance budget includes a specific provision to enable Irish Aid to respond to humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters.  We have increased this dedicated humanitarian assistance budget line from &euro;57.5 million in 2014 to &euro;58.5 million in 2015.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian programme is implemented through valued partners, including NGOs, UN Agencies, the Red Cross Movement and other international organisations. These partners have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable in times of crisis and stress. </p><p>Last month Ireland pledged further funding of &euro;12 million to help meet the urgent needs of those affected by the Syria conflict in 2015. <i>This will bring the total value of the Government&rsquo;s response to the crisis in Syria to over &euro;41 million. </i>Ireland has responded to the plight of the victims of the Syrian conflict with a significant amount of humanitarian assistance for a country of our size.  We are also responding to the humanitarian situation in Northern Nigeria, where conflict has displaced civilian populations and has affected neighbouring countries, Chad and Cameroon.  We will continue to respond to the effects of conflict in other regions, including South Sudan and Central African Republic.</p><p>At a global level, Ireland is a major supporter of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The ICRC has a permanent mandate under the Geneva Conventions to take impartial action for prisoners, the wounded and sick, and civilians affected by conflict.  It is often the best placed to provide assistance in conflict situations and where other organisations cannot operate.  In recent years, Ireland&rsquo;s core support for ICRC has helped the agency to provide life-saving assistance in conflict situations such as Somalia, Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Syria and South Sudan. Last year, Ireland provided over &euro;9 million to the ICRC to support its global operations in conflict contexts and we intend to maintain this level of support in 2015. </p></reply>

These efforts are finally showing progress as transmission rates start to decline.  The EU and its Member States have so far committed over &euro;1.2 billion to the Ebola response.  In 2014, Ireland provided over &euro;18 million, directly and through NGOs, to the most affected countries.  This included some &euro;10 million through our annual development programmes in our partner countries - Sierra Leone and Liberia &ndash; which have a particular focus on strengthening the national health systems.  We provided over &euro;5.6 million specifically for Ebola treatment facilities and for work on contact-tracing, community mobilisation and child nutrition programmes, among other activities.  </p>  <p>  The very serious wider implications of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa were the subject of a high-level international conference on Ebola in Brussels on 3   March which I attended.  A secondary crisis is emerging due to the impact on food security, nutrition, employment and economic growth as normal agricultural and market activities have been disrupted.  Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will need ongoing support and assistance from the international community in order to rebuild their economies and their health systems.  This will be a strong focus of our bilateral programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2015 and beyond.</p>  <p>  The unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in West Africa last year exposed a lack of preparedness on the part of the countries directly affected, and the international community, to cope with an epidemic of this magnitude and its far-reaching consequences.  Among the initiatives underway to avoid a recurrence are the resolution agreed at a special session of the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Executive Board in January, which formally initiated an urgent lessons learned process aimed at being able to respond with greater speed and effectiveness in future to health crises such as an Ebola outbreak. </p></reply>

Although no country is expected to join the European Union in the immediate future, we believe that it is important to actively engage with our European partners and with candidate countries to advance the accession process. Enlargement is a conditional process: prospective member states must implement reforms in order to make progress on their respective EU paths and the European Commission continues to work actively to support them in this task.     The European Council has granted Candidate Status to six countries - Turkey, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and Albania. In addition, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo are potential candidate countries. </p>  <p>  Turkey was granted Candidate status by the European Council in December 1999 and the European Council agreed to begin accession negotiations in December 2004. Fourteen out of thirty-five Chapters have been opened for negotiation, of which one has been provisionally closed.</p>  <p>  Accession negotiations with Iceland remain suspended following a decision of the Icelandic Government in early 2013.</p>  <p>  The European Union began accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012 and eighteen negotiating Chapters are now open, of which two have been provisionally closed. </p>  <p>  Serbia began accession negotiations in January 2014 and the screening process was concluded on 24 March 2015. Next steps include action plans to be prepared by the Serbian Government before any chapters are formally opened. The normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo will be important in this context. </p>  <p>  The European Union granted Macedonia Candidate Status in 2005 but the opening of accession negotiations was delayed, pending a resolution of the name dispute with Greece. </p>  <p>  Albania was granted Candidate Status in June 2014. Ireland supported this step as a signal of positive encouragement to the Albanian Government, and the region as a whole, to maintain the reform momentum. Before negotiations can be opened, Albania will need to demonstrate additional progress on a number of key priorities: continuing public administration reform, intensifying anti-corruption efforts and reinforcing freedom of expression. </p>  <p>  Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet formally applied for EU membership and thus remains a potential candidate country. In December 2014, Member States agreed on a &lsquo;renewed approach&rsquo; towards Bosnia, which undertook to activate the country&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) when Bosnia&rsquo;s political leaders agreed on a Written Commitment outlining socio-economic, judicial and institutional reforms. In February 2015, Bosnia&rsquo;s Parliament endorsed this Written Commitment, which is to be implemented by Bosnia&rsquo;s new government.  </p>  <p>  Kosovo has continued negotiations with the European Commission on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step on the EU accession path. The SAA was initialled in July 2014 and future steps will be discussed in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Ireland looks forward to working with each country as they make progress on their respective paths to EU membership. </p></reply>

More than 220,000 people have been killed, and some 7.6 million have been displaced within Syria, with almost 4 million more as refugees in neighbouring countries. This rate of displacement has accelerated over the last year. There are 1.7 million refugees in Turkey, nearly 1.2 million in Lebanon, 628,000 in Jordan and 247,000 in Iraq, with others also in North Africa. This poses a particular strain for Jordan and Lebanon, small countries where refugees are now a huge percentage of the population. Within just seven years, Syria has moved from being the world&rsquo;s second-largest refugee-hosting country, to being the largest refugee-producing country. Elsewhere in the Middle East, conflict has also driven people from their homes.  In Iraq, following the three major ISIS offensives in 2014, the humanitarian situation remains precarious for almost 2.7 million internally displaced Iraqis and over 247,000 Syrian refugees.  Some of these Syrian refugees are now suffering secondary displacement, having had to leave the places where they originally sought safety after fleeing Syria.    The situation in Yemen is also extremely worrying, with hundreds killed in the current outbreak of fighting. Already, before the current upsurge in violence, there were 15.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. More than 100,000 people have been displaced since the airstrikes began on 26 March, and the fighting there is continuing, prolonging the suffering of hundreds of thousands of innocent Yemenis.</p>  <p>  There are some 5 million Palestine refugees across the region in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip who continue to rely on the UN for basic services.  Of particular concern are the estimated 100,000 people who remain internally displaced following the conflict in Gaza last year.</p>  <p>  The UN has overall responsibility for coordination of the humanitarian response in such emergencies, and has established Humanitarian Coordinators in all of these situations in order to ensure that international humanitarian aid is directed to those who need it most. Ireland strongly supports the UN in this role.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has contributed to alleviating the suffering caused in all of these crises. Most notably, in Syria, Irish Aid&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance will reach &euro;41 million by the end of 2015, by which time we will have fulfilled the pledge made at the UN pledging conference on Syria in Kuwait last month. Ireland has also contributed &euro;500,000 to support the UN&rsquo;s work in Yemen this year, and provided the same amount last year. In Iraq, Ireland provided over &euro;1 million in support of humanitarian aid in 2014.  We provide &euro;4 million annually to UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for providing basic services to Palestine refugees across the region.  In addition we have so far provided &euro;1.5 million to the agency for its response to the Gaza crisis.</p>  <p>  However, international humanitarian support does not go far enough in providing solutions for those displaced by conflict from their homes. Political solutions are required, in order to ensure that people throughout the Middle East can resume their lives, and build their futures and those of their children in peace and security.  With our EU partners and at the UN, Ireland will continue to support all efforts for a peaceful solution to the interlinked conflicts across the region. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s official aid programme, Irish Aid, has always had a strong focus on the fight to end extreme poverty, and this commitment is central to our international development cooperation policy &ldquo;One World One Future&rdquo;.  In this policy, the Government commits to very regular assessment of our efforts in developing countries to ensure that we are delivering the most effective results for those experiencing greater degrees of hunger, fragility and instability, because of conflict, disaster or the harmful effects of climate change.  Ireland directs the greater part of its assistance to some of the poorest countries in the world.  Approximately 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance goes to Least Developed and Low Income countries and to Africa.  Sub-Saharan Africa remains our priority region of focus.  The selection and continued engagement in key partner countries is shaped by a number of key decision-making factors including the level of poverty, fragility and inequality in the country. </p>  <p>  Programmes funded with this development assistance are designed and monitored to ensure that our support is appropriately targeted and reaches the intended beneficiaries.  They are appraised by the Department using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, and cost effectiveness. Programmes are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts, as well as by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit.</p>  <p>  Robust accountability systems in partner countries are essential to ensuring that development assistance is appropriately targeted to reach the poorest and most vulnerable beneficiaries.  Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of these systems.  Our own management and oversight systems are regularly under review to ensure that Irish development funding continues to be provided to those most in need, and that we meet the highest standards of accountability.</p>  <p>  We continue to work through a variety of bilateral and other aid delivery channels in partnership with national authorities, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations. This mix of aid channels globally and in our partner countries ensures that, despite the changing and sometimes challenging contexts where we have to work, we make the utmost effort to target our aid towards the very poorest.</p>  <p>  Our aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the most effective in this regard.  The OECD Peer Review of the programme last year noted that our international development policy provides a sound rationale and basis for making decisions on where to focus Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance.   It stated that the policy and our related strategies help ensure that Irish aid targets poor people and gets assistance to where it is most needed.  </p></reply>

In the Government&rsquo;s recent review of foreign policy, <i>The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World</i>, we re-affirmed our commitment to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights, to accountability for human rights violations and abuses, and to the protection of those who are most vulnerable and marginalised.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council.We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, the Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. </p><p>The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly, and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has always been a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on international development, &lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo;, reaffirms the centrality of human rights to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and aid programme, and commits to ensuring that human rights principles and standards are promoted, protected and integrated in all of our development efforts. The Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, addresses the root causes of poverty and exclusion by focussing on the most vulnerable and promoting their participation, representation, and the means to realise their rights.  This includes investing in the improvement and expansion of essential services, and support to organisations that promote human rights, governance, and democracy in developing countries, including civil society and the UN office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, Irish Aid promotes access to justice and supports the strengthening of government institutions, parliaments, and independent media, and national human rights institutions.</p><p>The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

Foreign Ministers have focused in particular on the contribution that the EU can make through its external action to the wider international effort to prevent and counter terrorism.</p>  <p>  Counter-terrorism was most recently discussed by Foreign Affairs Council on 19 January and 9 February 2015.  The February Council called for comprehensive action against terrorism in full compliance with international law, fundamental values and international human rights standards.  It decided to step up, as a matter of urgency, external action on countering terrorism and to this end it agreed detailed conclusions under five headings.  These headings concerned: strengthening partnerships with key countries, supporting capacity building, countering radicalisation and violent extremism, promoting international cooperation and addressing underlying factors and ongoing crises.</p>  <p>  Discussions by Foreign Ministers on external measures are complemented by those of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on internal EU security.  The issue has featured regularly on the agenda of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.  Following their meeting in Riga on 29 and 30 January, JHA Ministers issued a joint statement with wide ranging conclusions on measures to prevent and combat terrorism.  </p>  <p>  The need for coordination between the work of Foreign Ministers and Justice and Home Affairs Ministers is particularly important, especially when it comes to the threat posed by international terrorism and returning foreign terrorist fighters.  The crucial importance of joint efforts was explicitly recognised in the Riga Statement.</p>  <p>  The informal European Council on 12 February took account of the discussions and conclusions of the February FAC and the Riga statement.  In their statement, EU Heads of State and Government set out a range of priorities to guide further work by both Council formations.  These priorities were set out under three headings: ensuring the security of citizens, preventing radicalisation and safeguarding values, and cooperating with our international partners.</p>  <p>  An extraordinary joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council took place on 20 April 2015 to discuss migration against the recent tragic events in the Mediterranean. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald TD, and I attended. The root causes of the instability which contribute to migratory pressures, including conflict and terrorism, were addressed in our discussions.</p></reply>

The forthcoming EaP Summit in Riga, on 21 and 22 May, was discussed at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers with the six Eastern Partners in Luxembourg yesterday. The Riga Summit will provide an opportunity to reflect on the progress of the Eastern Partnership, bearing in mind particularly the situation in Ukraine. The Riga Summit will also confirm the high importance which the EU, its Member States and the six partner countries attach to the Partnership.  The Summit should set the course for the Partnership for next two years.The situation in Ukraine has deteriorated rapidly during the past 12 months. The EU is closely following developments in eastern Ukraine and has been to the forefront of international efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully. It is also helping Ukraine to implement a much needed programme of political and economic reforms aimed at strengthening the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions and modernising its economy. In the last year, the EU has channelled almost &euro;6 billion to Ukraine in the form of macro financial assistance, grant aid and support from European financial institutions.</p><p>In that context, Ireland hopes the Summit will convey a message that the aim of the Eastern Partnership is to build a common area of shared democracy, prosperity, stability and increased cooperation.  The Partnership is not directed against anyone<i></i>and Ireland hopes that the Riga Summit will be an opportunity to help rebuild trust and confidence on our continent.</p><p>An important focus of the Riga Summit will be progress, with the assistance of the EU, on the implementation of Association Agreements (AA) concluded between the EU and Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in 2013.  The Deputy will recall our very useful discussion of these Agreements which this House subsequently approved by large majority. </p><p>I am happy to confirm that last week Ireland formally completed its ratification of these Agreements which are, in large measure, already being applied provisionally by the three countries concerned.  However, in response to a Ukrainian request arising from its concerns about the impact of an immediate application of the Agreement&rsquo;s Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), the European Commission agreed to delay its provisional application to Ukraine until 1 January 2016.  In the meantime, the EU will continue the application of autonomous trade measures for the benefit of Ukraine.  </p><p>The Riga Summit will also consider progress on the EU&rsquo;s relations with those partner countries that chose not to conclude Association Agreements - Armenia, Azerbaijan - and developments in the EU&rsquo;s critical engagement with Belarus. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s key strategic priorities in its engagement with the United Nations are outlined in the recently published foreign policy document <i>The Global Island. </i>Ireland will remain a key contributor to UN and UN-mandated peacekeeping operations and will continue to contribute to developing UN policies and structures to enable it to more effectively maintain international<font color="#004080"> </font>peace and security.

Ireland&rsquo;s term of office as a member of the UN Human Rights Council will conclude at the end of 2015. In this remaining period and beyond, we will continue to pursue our national initiatives on civil society space and preventable mortality and morbidity in children under five, and to promote our human rights priorities which include freedom of expression both online and offline, freedom of religion and belief, Human Rights Defenders, the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals, gender equality, rights of the child and the right to education. </p><p>Ireland is co-facilitating intergovernmental negotiations at the United Nations to agree a framework for global development to succeed the Millennium Development Goals beyond 2015.  Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities for the post-2015 Development Agenda have been the fight to end hunger and under nutrition, gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment, good governance and rule of law.

The Departmental Inspectorates' advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.In line with Circular 30/2014 schools are required to put in place a Personal Pupil Plan including a care plan for all pupils availing of SNA support.</p><p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>  These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Support Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (2013) and The Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs (2014). </p><p>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

However, from the information that is readily available, the following table indicates, by county, the additional design team fee payments made in 2014 and to date in 2015 arising from the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations BC(A)R 2014. </p><p>  In terms of the number of school building projects affected it is safe to say that all projects where the design team was appointed prior to 2014 are affected to a greater or lesser extent and that additional costs will arise in virtually every case. General details in respect of the current status of all major school building projects is available on my Departments website and is updated monthly. </p><p>  Requests for fee adjustments by individual consultants engaged as part of the design team on a school building project may vary significantly from project to project depending on the scale and complexity of the project, the characteristics of the site and the materials and methods of construction proposed, the number of site visits required and the distance to site from the consultants place of work. </p><p>  Information in relation to fee adjustment requests would also be commercially sensitive as my Department is engaged in ongoing negotiations with individual design team members in respect of fee claims arising from the additional services required under BC(A)R 2014. Guidance for members of the RIAI and the ACEI on the factors to consider when calculating a fee adjustment request for a school building project are available on those bodies websites. In general, the Department would expect fee adjustment requests to reflect the advice given in those guidance notes.</p><p>However, the Department will assess each individual request on its specific merits and circumstances and in accordance with the conditions of engagement and the existing fee structure tendered by the individual consultant at time of appointment.  </p><p>However, from analysis of a representative sample of fee adjustment requests, the indication is that fee adjustments for a full design team may vary from approximately 10 per cent to 30 per cent depending on the above mentioned factors. Currently, all tender competitions for appointment of design teams require tenderers to include for the provision of services to meet the requirements of BC(A)R 2014 as an inherent part of their fee proposals.  <table><tr><th>County</th><th><div>2014</div></th><th><div>2015</div></th></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>&euro;0.00</div></td><td><div>&euro;3,867.12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>&euro;0.00</div></td><td><div>&euro;6,624.84</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>&euro;19,266.61</div></td><td><div>&euro;46,714.71</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>&euro;0.00</div></td><td><div>&euro;16,453.27</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>&euro;0.00</div></td><td><div>&euro;2,767.50</div></td></tr><tr><td>KIldare</td><td><div>&euro;19,730.14</div></td><td><div>&euro;3,506.97</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>&euro;8,647.28</div></td><td><div>&euro;0.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td><div>&euro;11,980.01</div></td><td><div>&euro;5,993.71</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>&euro;23,811.90</div></td><td><div>&euro;9,292.05</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>&euro;23,281.13</div></td><td><div>&euro;9,457.16</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>&euro;0.00</div></td><td><div>&euro;22,772.93</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>&euro;16,897.66</div></td><td><div>&euro;27,289.92</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>&euro;13,854.23</div></td><td><div>&euro;18,588.89</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>&euro;137,468.96</div></td><td><div>&euro;173,329.07</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Minimums and maximums apply to these grants which reflect the estimated minimum running costs of small schools and the economies of scale that may be achieved in larger schools. </p><p>  Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These classes have a lower Pupil Teacher ratio and as such the unit cost per pupil is higher. </p><p>  It is extremely difficult to make valid comparisons between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post primary levels. However it is accepted that the maintenance costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools. In general, second level schools have a lower pupil teacher ratio, resulting in more classrooms and this would lead to higher per unit costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</p><p>  In addition the second level capitation is required to cover a different range of expenditures. Second level schools provide a broader curriculum, including technical subjects where the costs of materials may be greater than at primary level. In addition, specialist equipment and rooms are required for some subjects, leading to higher maintenance/replacement costs.</p><p>  I am determined that education will be prioritised for further investment in future years, and I believe that increasing the staffing and funding of our schools should be priorities for such investment. </p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.</p><p>  The alleviation arrangements set out in Circular 0004/2014 provide a floor by which schools acutely affected at AP level by the impact of the moratorium can fill their AP vacancies as they arise to the level of the thresholds set out in that circular. </p><p>  It continues to be a matter for each individual school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.</p><p>  However, I think it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance, the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed. </p><p>  Simply lifting the moratorium as extra funding becomes available in future years is not the best way of improving how school leadership is distributed in our schools.</p><p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. </p><p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed. </p></reply>

A small number of special schools operate in tandem with facilities where residential care is provided for children in care; in these circumstances, the work of the schools is inspected by the Inspectorate of my Department while the residential care facilities are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).

Since 2012, a follow-through model of inspection has been implemented to determine the extent to which schools have implemented the main recommendations in inspection reports, and the follow-through inspections conducted to date indicate a high level of implementation.

The Government remains committed to the further development of our research ecosystem given the key role that it plays not only in underpinning economic recovery and maintaining Ireland's competitiveness, but also given its centrality to the quality of our higher education system and the broader societal developments that research drives.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the process of developing a successor strategy to the SSTI is underway. The formulation of the new Strategy provides a clear opportunity for Ireland to develop a new whole-of-Government strategy for research and innovation that can build on the progress made to date and is timely as Ireland moves into a new phase of economic growth and societal development. An Interdepartmental Committee, under the chairmanship of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been tasked with developing proposals for this new Strategy. I am represented on this Committee by officials from my Department and they are closely engaged with the process. An important element of this process is stakeholder and public consultation and some 75 submissions have been received, including from the higher education sector. The issue of future funding for all areas of research will be considered in the context of the completion of this work.</p></reply>

As part of its remit the SEC is required to maintain standards year on year and this it endeavours to achieve by the processes it has in place for the preparation of examination papers and other test items, and by the quality assurance procedures it implements at the examining and appeal stages of the state examinations.</p>  <p>  The same marking scheme is applied strictly and in exactly the same way to the work of all candidates in the cohort taking the particular examination. Each candidate is anonymous and examining proceeds without reference to school location or centre.</p>  <p>  In respect of the determination of grade boundaries, all examination systems have grade boundaries.  In Ireland 'fixed' grade boundaries apply (i.e. the mark equating to particular percentages from the point at which one moves from the award of one grade to another) and the standard setting process, operates within this framework.  The manner in which a candidate achieves an overall grade varies from subject to subject; for example in multi-components &ndash; marks for the different components are aggregated. It is emphasised to examiners that every mark is important and that they should be accurate and exact in their application of a marking scheme in order to award an appropriate mark for the work presented. As is the case in all examination systems there will always be candidates whose mark falls one mark short of a grade boundary.</p>  <p>  A formal appeals process is provided by the SEC. It is open to every candidate to appeal the result awarded in any particular subject.  The Leaving Certificate appeal process is a sophisticated process which provides candidates, who have fallen short by one or more marks to achieve the grade they may desire, every opportunity to determine that the marking scheme that applied to all candidates, was in fact applied correctly to them and that the mark finally awarded is in fact the correct mark that should apply.</p>  <p>  In the case of the grading system applied by the SEC neither a system of 'rounding up' or 'rounding down' of percentages applies.  Grading tables are drawn up on the basis of the exact mark awarded corresponding to a particular grade band (e.g. for an examination marked out of 400, such as Leaving Certificate Biology, a mark of 360 will be awarded a grade of A1 (90% or more) and a mark of 359 will be awarded a grade of A2 (85% or more and less than 90%).</p></reply>

Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable.

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement. The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination.  In May 2013, the PRTB launched a national rent index available at .  Compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute and based on the PRTB&rsquo;s own register of over 300,000 tenancies, this valuable source of information indicates the actual rents being paid for rented properties throughout the State.  The rent index is updated quarterly and shows the percentage change in rents over the previous quarter and over the previous twelve months. </p><p>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles. Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act.  </p><p>A landlord may not serve a notice of termination except in very clearly defined circumstances set out in the Act, such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy or where the landlord intends to sell the dwelling.  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 112 days are provided for under section 66 of the Act.  Where there is a dispute regarding the validity of a notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the PRTB for resolution.</p><p>Section 86(1) of the 2004 Act provides that pending the determination of a dispute that has been referred to the Board, the rent payable under the tenancy continues to be payable and, if the dispute relates to the amount of rent payable, no increase in the amount of the rent may be made.  This does not apply if, where awaiting the outcome of the dispute case, the parties agree to payment of the rent being suspended or if they agree to an increase in the amount of the rent being made.  Subject to section 86(2), section 86(1) also provides that a termination of the tenancy concerned may not be effected pending the determination of a dispute. </p><p>Section 14 of the Act provides that a landlord of a dwelling shall not penalise a tenant for referring any dispute between the tenant and the landlord to the Board for resolution. For the purpose of the Act, a tenant is penalised if the tenant is subjected to any action that adversely affects his or her enjoying peaceful occupation of the dwelling concerned. An action may constitute penalisation even though it consists of steps taken by the landlord in the exercise of his or her rights under the 2004 Act. </p></reply>

Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.   When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options are in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. Irish Water also intends participating in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  The Government intends to bring forward legislation to enhance the collectability of domestic water charges, building on the approach set out in the Water Services Act 2014. Further details on the modalities involved will be available on publication of the draft legislation following Government approval.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October. Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.</p><p>There are now over 1,500 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. </p><p>During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee. Data for this report is being gathered from pilot sites and a progress report will be submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht shortly. Based on data gathered for the review, consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP as part of the pilot on an incremental basis this year. While no implementation date has yet been agreed, my Department is in contact with Mayo County Council in relation to their inclusion in the next phase of HAP statutory pilot. </p></reply>

Other factors, such as upward only rent reviews, parking charges, rising energy costs and on-line trading, have also been cited as factors affecting the viability of small and medium-sized businesses in the retail sector.</p>  <p>  To help address this issue, a number of initiatives have been taken by my Department in recent years, as follows:</p>  <p>- local authorities were requested to exercise restraint, or where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges to assist local businesses in the current economic climate &ndash; the vast majority of local authorities have responded positively to this request,</p>  <p>- revised development contribution guidelines were introduced in January 2013 requesting planning authorities to put in place reduced development contributions to support town centre development and incentivise activity in the areas prioritised for development in the relevant core strategy,</p>  <p>- the publication of new guidelines on retail planning in April 2012 aimed at promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres. These guidelines retained the previous caps on store size in less populated and smaller towns, and were aimed at striking the right balance to ensure that local monopolies are not created in smaller towns which would be detrimental to competition. </p>  <p>  In terms of Government action other than by my Department in providing assistance to retail businesses and stimulating economic activity in local communities, a number of measures have been introduced since 2011, including &ndash; </p>  <p>- the introduction of the 9% rate of VAT on certain goods and services,</p>  <p>- the halving of the lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI,</p>  <p>- the introduction of the Microenterprise Loan Scheme and Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which schemes have had take-up from the retail sector, and</p>  <p>- the extension of seed capital and the employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector.</p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to working with other Government Departments, with local government and with other community development and enterprise stakeholders with a view to providing a clear framework for addressing urban centre decline and its impacts on the retail sector, and will continue to explore all relevant options for further action in this regard.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland has been allocated &euro;1.2 billion of Structural Funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020. The new ERDF regulation requires an increased focus on sustainable urban development and urban regeneration. In its Partnership Agreement with the European Commission on the new ERDF regulation, the Government has agreed that an urban development fund with a total value of &euro;80million will be available over the duration of the programme. Local authorities will be invited to bid for this ERDF support for projects that will contribute to the social, economic and environmental development of their urban areas.

The Act sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy and these apply whether or not a receiver is in place.  While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the appointment of a receiver cannot affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants under the Act.</p>  <p>  In 2013 the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) published a guide to receivership for residential tenants.  The guide explains that where a receiver is appointed to a rented residential property, the rent should be paid directly to the receiver and that a receipt should be given by the receiver to the tenant.  The guide also advises tenants to contact the receiver in the first instance regarding requests for repairs to the property. This guide is a useful contribution to a clearer understanding of the relationship between receivers and residential tenants.</p>  <p>  Through the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill which is currently before the Oireachtas, I intend to introduce an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act that will help to bring greater clarity in this area and will be of benefit to tenants and receivers alike.  This will provide that where a person is appointed as a receiver to carry out the functions and exercise the powers of a landlord under a tenancy, that person will be considered to be the landlord for the purposes of the 2004 Act.</p>  <p>  The appointment of a receiver and decisions around the type of receiver to be appointed are commercial matters for the bank or financial institution concerned and it would not be appropriate to interfere in that process.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.</p>  <p>  Following a review in 2010 of the Community Support for Older People (CSOP), the forerunner for the Seniors Alert Scheme, one of the recommendations was that a centralised procurement process would simplify the scheme. By decreasing the level of administration for groups, this would allow them to spend more time on the key aim of the scheme, which is enhanced interaction with older persons and would also achieve value for money through economies of scale. As a result, more people could benefit from the scheme or additional equipment, such as smoke detectors and/or carbon monoxide alarms, could be made available through the scheme. Community and Voluntary Groups and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contributed to the review and a number of national organisations including Age Action Ireland, Irish Rural Link, Irish Senior Citizen&rsquo;s Parliament, Muintir na T&iacute;re, The Carers Association and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, assisted with the terms of reference for the review.</p>  <p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.</p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. The tender included a requirement for suppliers to set out their value added services. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete. Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that SMEs were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes.</p>  <p>  A monitoring services panel was also advertised via eTenders on 6 November 2014.  This process will engage a panel of quality checked monitoring suppliers who will outline the costs they charge and the service they provide.  This information will be provided to the community groups and individuals to ensure they can make the best choice in relation to the monitoring services supplier.  The use of this panel is voluntary; monitoring costs are not grant-aided and have always been the responsibility of the beneficiary. The older person will continue to be responsible for choosing the monitoring supplier of their choice.</p>  <p>  The transfer of the operation of the scheme to Pobal is scheduled for completion by end July 2015; the strategic policy direction of the Scheme will remain my Department&rsquo;s responsibility. In the meantime, community and voluntary groups wishing to draw down grant support under the Seniors Alert Scheme should continue to apply to my Department in the usual way. </p></reply>

The Social Housing Strategy 2020 targets the supply of 35,000 additional social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion over the next 6 years, as well as meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through local authority provision via the private rented sector, using the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Schemes.</p>  <p>  The overall targets in the Social Housing Strategy were developed having regard to the nature and scale of social housing need, taking account of analysis of the most recent statutory Assessment of Housing Need, which was carried out by the Housing Agency.  The social housing targets for each local authority area out to 2017 that I recently announced are fully in line with the targets of the Social Housing Strategy. Targets identified for individual local authorities were determined in consideration of the potential impact that delivery over 2015&ndash;2017 would have on social housing need as evidenced by local authority waiting lists recorded in the most recent statutory Assessment of Housing Need. The target setting process also took account of specific housing unit targets and building projects out to 2017 proposed by each local authority.</p>  <p>  A key reason for the variation in regard to the impact on local housing lists lies in the variation in the level s of housing need locally. Certain areas have relatively lower numbers on local housing lists, with a consequence that the targets set for such authorities have a relatively high percentage impact on the lists. Conversely, while other authorities have had considerably higher targets set for them, the impact is proportionally not as high given the higher number on the housing lists of those areas.  It is the case, however, that the targets that I have announced illustrate once again that housing is of the highest priority for the Government. Ambitious targets have been set for each local authority and they will have a major impact for those on the housing waiting lists, with a national reduction of 25% targeted over the period through these targets alone.</p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring progress against these targets into the future, including the impact on housing need, it is important to note that the governance of the Social Housing Strategy includes monitoring and review arrangements. Specifically, a review of the strategy will take place in 2017 to assess overall progress. In addition, we will carry out housing needs assessment s on an annual basis from 2016 which will support the continuous monitoring of social housing delivery against need.</p></reply>

These units will include those that will be constructed or acquired by local authorities through various means. Each local authority has responsibility for identifying their area&rsquo;s social housing need and responding as required, including planning and undertaking new social housing developments to meet this need. Accordingly, the location and specific number of the units to be constructed through local authority managed contracts, the number to be acquired, the number to be constructed by private developers or public-private partnerships, the location of these developments, including land banks to be used, and the specific commencement and completion date for construction projects, are all matters in the first instance for the local authorities concerned. </p><p>Under the Social Housing Strategy, the opportunity to bring vacant or boarded-up social housing units back into productive use will continue to be supported, as a common-sense and value for money approach to the delivery of social housing units. The exact breakdown of such units that will be tackled out to 2017 cannot be specified at this point, as assessments of such stock are submitted annually by each local authority and vacant units to be remediated and brought back to use are quantified across all authorities at that point. For 2015, the number of such units targeted for Counties Louth and Meath, respectively, are 9 and 27.</p><p>Of the 778 units announced for County Louth for the period 2015 to 2017, a target of 288 units has been set for delivery under capital programmes and 490 units under current programmes. Of the 519 units announced for County Meath, the equivalent figures are 134 units under capital programmes and 385 units under current programmes. These breakdowns have been notified to the local authorities.</p><p>The number of additional social housing units that are targeted under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme, previously referred to as the Social Housing Leasing Initiative, to 2017 nationally under the Social Housing Strategy is 11,400. The number targeted in respect of Counties Louth and Meath are 443 and 284, respectively. However, it is important to highlight that the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme is a national fund without individual authority funding allocations. Where a local authority can exceed its target it should be possible to fund such additional units with the agreement of the Department. </p><p>The number of additional social housing units targeted under the Rental Accommodation Scheme nationally to 2017 under the Social Housing Strategy is 4,000. The number of such units targeted in respect of Counties Louth and Meath are 47 and 101, respectively. </p><p>Proposals already made by local authorities for the development of social housing units have been assessed and a first phase of announcements of initial project approvals will be made shortly. We are working with all local authorities to ensure that the projects proposed represent value for money and, in the case of capital-funded projects, are developed in compliance with the Capital Works Management Framework. I will be monitoring progress on delivery of units under the Social Housing Strategy and if satisfactory progress is not being made, I will reallocate funding between local authorities in order that national targets are achieved. </p><p>The targets that I announced illustrate once again that housing is of the highest priority for the Government. There are ambitious targets for each local authority and these will have a major impact for those on housing waiting lists, with a national reduction of 25% targeted over the period through these targets alone. I have met with representatives of a number of local authorities in recent months, as has my colleague Minister Coffey, in relation to social housing issues and I will continue that dialogue with other authorities in the months ahead.</p></reply>

At the end of 2014, 485 households were in receipt of a HAP payment across 7 pilot local authorities.</p>  <p>  An Exchequer allocation of &euro;23,200,000 has been made for HAP within my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2015. This amount is to meet the cost, primarily, of payments to landlords in respect of an additional 8,400 HAP recipients , as well as the on-going funding commitment associated with the 485 households in receipt of HAP at end 2014. This allocation will also meet the on-going administration costs of local authorities. There are now some 1,500 households in receipt of the HAP payment across the pilot areas.</p>  <p>  It is intended to keep the above arrangements under review as HAP is rolled out to other local authorities including a full review of the statutory pilot phase when complete. </p>  <p>Exchequer allocations for the Rent Supplement Scheme are a matter for my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

The implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 strategy will support increased housing supply. New house completions in 2014 amounted to 11,016 units nationally, up 33% on the 2013 figure.  In the third quarter of 2014, planning permissions were granted for 2,144 dwellings, compared with 1,409 units for the same period in 2013 - an increase of 52%. In addition, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of just over 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.</p><p>During the preparation of the Social Housing Strategy, the Housing Agency carried out an analysis of the 89,872 households recorded by local authorities as being in need of social housing as of May 2013.  The purpose of the analysis was to determine the minimum number of additional residential units required to meet the needs of those households qualified for social housing support.  While there is no specific analysis of the potential impact on rents as a result of leasing and acquisition activity by local authorities <i>per se</i>, the methodology underpinning the calculation of the 35,000 new units required took cognisance of the dynamics in the market as between tenure types.</p><p>The methodology used to estimate the number of additional properties required to meet social housing demand can be found on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>.  Further analysis is due to be carried out in 2015.</p></reply>

The target I announced in respect of County Tipperary out to 2017 was 832 social housing units, of which 287 units have been targeted for delivery under capital programmes and 545 units under current programmes. This breakdown has been notified to the local authority. Furthermore, proposals made by local authorities, including Tipperary County Council, for the development of social housing units are being assessed by my Department and a first phase of announcements of initial project approvals will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  The delivery of the targets set for County Tipperary will reduce the housing waiting list in the local authority area by 42%.</p></reply>

While an EU allocation of &euro;2,190 million is available to Ireland, &euro;2,037 million of this is allocated to measures to be delivered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The remaining &euro;153 million of the EU funding is allocated to my Department for the delivery of LEADER measures. National funding has been allocated to bring the total funding under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 to &euro;4 billion.</p>  <p>  The co-funding rate for the LEADER element of the programme is 65% (EAFRD) and 35% (National Exchequer) which brings the programme complement for the LEADER elements to &euro;235 million. In addition to this, two Agri Foods schemes with a budget of &euro;15 million will be delivered using the LEADER approach resulting in an overall programme complement for LEADER of &euro;250 million.</p>  <p>  Ireland is reconfiguring the way in which local and rural development interventions are implemented. This is in line with Government policy to ensure that local government is well positioned to support the effective and efficient delivery of local and rural development. In this context, &euro;220 million of the overall programme complement for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries to 28 sub-regional areas.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;10 million has been allocated to the cooperation element of the programme. &euro;15 million has been allocated for the delivery of two agri-food schemes which will be managed jointly by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and my Department. In addition, &euro;5 million is being held in reserve for the purposes of supporting the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) initiative, pending the successful outcome of a Pilot scheme as identified in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA).</p>  <p>  In determining the county allocations, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable allocation. However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county. The methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the programme.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a partnership approach between the Government and the commercial telecommunications sector.A key element of the National Broadband Plan is the creation of a policy and regulatory environment that helps stimulate commercial investment. In 2014, the Oireachtas passed legislation introduced by my Department, which has enabled ESB to enter the telecommunications market using its extensive electricity distribution network. Following the enactment of the legilsation, the two shareholding Ministers - the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform - consented to ESB entering into a Joint Venture with Vodafone Ireland. The two companies have since announced plans to deliver fibre-to-the-home services to 500,000 homes and businesses in 50 towns across Ireland, with the possibility of a further expansion of this &euro;450m investment programme. </p><p>This commercial development is bringing competition in the provision of high speed services to rural towns across Ireland. The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades, and particularly in the provision of high speed broadband. In the space of just over two years, commercial operators have rolled out services to 1.1m of Ireland's 2.3m premises and within the next year and a half, 1.6m premises will be able to access these services. This represents 70% of the premises in Ireland. </p><p>Working closely with industry, last November I published a national high speed coverage map which provides detail of every premises that will have access to high speed broadband from commercial operators by the end of 2016. This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent the 70% of premises that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016. The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.</p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area. Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. </p><p>In delivering this combination of commercial and State-led investment in high speed broadband, I and my Department are engaging intensively with all commercial operators, including ESB/Vodafone. Consultation in relation to the mapping exercise continues, and we have also met with operators who may be interested in the bidding process for the State-led intervention, including ESB/Vodafone. The Department has also visited two pilot high speed broadband projects, which include an eircom rural fibre-to-the-home pilot in Belcarra Co Mayo, and ESB / Vodafone fibre-to-the-home trial in Cavan town. </p><p>Details of our engagement with industry are provided in monthly updates on the Department's mapping website </p></reply>
