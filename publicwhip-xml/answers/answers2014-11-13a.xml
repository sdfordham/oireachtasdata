This is evidenced by ongoing investment and upgrades to the barracks.  The Department is engaged in an ongoing capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces.  Under this programme there has been considerable capital investment at Custume Barracks, Athlone in recent years, amounting to some &euro;6.38m from 2009 to date.   </p><p>  The most recent major projects undertaken at the barracks include investment of &euro;932,000 in the construction of Armoured Vehicle Garaging facilities, &euro;1.8 million investment in a Gymnasium and an upgrading of gas and water main facilities including the provision of new underground services and associated works, at a cost of &euro;597,000.   </p><p>  In addition to the major capital projects as outlined above, there are ongoing works required to ensure the upkeep and repair of buildings and provide facilities generally for personnel.  Recent examples include the upgrading of Accommodation Blocks &lsquo;K&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo; (at a cost of &euro;357,000) in order to provide transit accommodation for personnel, including those relocated under the barrack consolidation programme.  Additional locker facilities were also provided, at a cost of &euro;397,000 for personnel transferring into the Barracks over that period.   </p></reply>

In accordance with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, my Department recoups from the HSE the costs of the Air Corps&rsquo; participation in the pilot service.  These include fixed costs, which are salaries and related personnel costs, as well as day-to-day operating costs such as, fuel and maintenance.  The total costs recouped from the HSE from the commencement of the pilot to date amount to approximately &euro;3.13m.    </p></reply>

The current Defence Forces contingent, the 46th Irish Infantry Group UNDOF, comprises 130 troops and consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements.  Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  Eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters, Camp Ziouani, including the Deputy Force Commander Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon.     </p><p>  Fighting between Syrian Arab Armed Forces and Anti Government Armed Elements has recently escalated in the UNDOF area of responsibility.  In August 2014 and in response to the hostilities, the Irish contingent, in its capacity as the Force Reserve Company, dealt with several incidents as requested by the Force Commander UNDOF, including assisting with the safe extraction of members of the Philippine Battalion. </p><p>   Given events on the ground, I called for the UN to undertake a review of the mission, particularly the capacity of the mission to fulfil its mandate in light of the civil war in Syria.  Since then there has been a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate. The Headquarters of the UNDOF mission, including the Irish contingent, has now been relocated from Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation to Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  The UN continues to review the mission and will provide regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard. </p></reply>

I presume the Deputy is referring to the claim that five members of the PDF were sleeping in cars because they could not afford the cost of commuting to their place of work, and claims that approximately 20% of PDFORRA&rsquo;s membership are availing of Family Income Supplement.  There is no reason why any member of the PDF should be sleeping in their car.  I am advised that military management wrote to the General Secretary of PDFORRA requesting information to facilitate the chain of command addressing any legitimate concerns of PDFORRA.  I understand that a response has been received from PDFORRA and that individual issues raised within it are now being appropriately addressed through the normal operational chain of command.   </p><p>  PDFORRA also asserted that approximately 20% of their membership is availing of Family Income Supplement, qualifying for it because their take home pay had fallen owing to various Public Service Agreements and statutory deductions.  As the circumstances surrounding an application for Family Income Supplement are a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Defence is not aware of the number of PDF members that may be in receipt of this financial assistance, or their individual circumstances.   </p></reply>

The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 191 personnel, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) with 138 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 12 personnel, EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 7 personnel, the EU-led Training Mission in Mali with 10 personnel and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with 7 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with several United Nations missions.  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>  Due to Ireland&rsquo;s own current level of commitment in overseas peacekeeping operations, notably to the United Nations Disengagement Force in Syria and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, we are not in a position to make any significant commitment to other missions at this time. </p><p>  The current contribution of some 418 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.   </p></reply>

Defence policy is a critical aspect of Government policy and I am determined to ensure that the new White Paper fully addresses the Defence response to future security challenges and related resource requirements in a comprehensive way.  Work on the new White Paper is progressing well. Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands and the types of defence capabilities required to meet these demands. In the course of their deliberations, the Working Groups are taking into consideration the inputs received from a wide variety of stakeholders. This includes the views of international organisations which have been sought with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support operations.</p><p>  Discussions have also been held with a range of other Government Departments on cross-cutting policy issues and likely future demands from Government bodies and State agencies. This includes discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade including on their ongoing review of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and external relations. These discussions are continuing, as required, throughout the White Paper process.</p><p>  I anticipate that an initial draft White Paper will be submitted to me for my consideration by the end of 2014. The final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to Government in due course.</p></reply>

The Department of Defence made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in June, 2014, as part of the CRE process. Following on from the CRE, Budget 2015 set out the overall financial envelope for the 2015-2017 period. Within this envelope, decisions on resource allocation are made on a prioritised basis in accordance with assessed operational requirements.  The Department is also preparing a new White Paper on Defence and this provides an opportunity to critically assess future demands and associated operational requirements. Working groups, which include both civil and military members, are considering likely future operational demands and the capabilities and resources required to meet these demands.</p><p>  The White Paper on Defence will inform key decisions regarding defence provision for the next decade. I look forward to receiving an initial draft by the end of the year and it is my intention to present a final draft for consideration by Government, in due course. My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the Defence Forces retain the capabilities to fulfil all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas. In this regard, it will be important that future funding provision is consistent with the policy requirements determined by the Government.</p></reply>

As recommended by the consultants, a number of working groups were set up to progress the various change projects identified. The working groups were tasked with identifying the practical steps which needed to be taken to achieve implementation of the PA report recommendations for the medical service. Following the completion of the work of the Working Groups an implementation plan was drawn up to implement their recommendations. Arising from the implementation plan the Central Medical Unit was formally established in 2012 to enable the detailed structures, processes and personnel to be put in place to provide for the support, management and delivery of modern medical services for the Defence Forces. This new Central Medical Unit brings all medical personnel under one central command. It has responsibility for the management and delivery of medical services, including the allocation of medical resources across the system based on operational requirements and demands.</p><p>  In relation to specific medical services, it was necessary to undertake a further exercise to identify the optimal options for service provision. A joint civilian/ military Standing Committee has been set up and tasked with advancing the development of a sustainable integrated medical service involving both internal and outsourced service provision to meet the needs of the Defence Forces as outlined in the PA Report. The Standing Committee is reviewing each medical service individually e.g. physiotherapy services, laboratory services, mental health services etc. in order to evaluate and make a recommendation regarding the most appropriate means of delivering the medical capability to the Defence Forces. For example a service that is currently delivered by staff in house may be outsourced or vice versa.  The Standing Committee is focussed on ensuring that medical services are delivered in an optimum and sustainable manner.</p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need and that I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters.  The Defence Forces were not deployed in an ATCP role to Dublin or Cork airports during the period in question. There were 362 ATCP deployments carried out by the Defence Forces to Shannon Airport during the 12 month period from the 6<sup>th</sup>November 2013 to the 6<sup>th</sup>of November 2014. The length of each such deployment and the number of relevant aircraft that land and take off during each deployment can vary.  For example, if a single aircraft is on the ground for an extended period, perhaps overnight, or over a number of days, this would involve more than one deployment of troops as each shift is generally of 12 hours duration.<br/><br/>The costs of these operations, which include Security Duty Allowance, rations and fuel, are met from the Defence Vote.</p></reply>

The Green Paper noted the requirement for a UN resolution as part of the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; reflects the central importance of the UN in granting legitimacy to peace support and crisis management missions. The Green Paper also noted that at the same time, the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; also constitutes a self imposed, legal constraint on the State&rsquo;s sovereignty in making decisions about the use of its armed forces.  The Green Paper recognised that on balance the advantages of retaining the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; mechanism can be seen as outweighing the disadvantages. Nonetheless it is an issue worthy of discussion in advance of the adoption of the next White Paper on Defence which will include an updated assessment of the future defence and security environment.</p><p>  The benefits of a formal legislative requirement for UN authorisation must be weighed against the possibility that this constraint may lead to an inability to act on occasions where there is a pressing moral or security imperative and overwhelming international support to do so, but where UN sanction is not forthcoming, in circumstances where a veto is exercised by a permanent member of the Security Council acting in its own national interests.</p><p>  It is acknowledged that there is substantial public support for the triple lock mechanism and that, in practical terms, due to the size of our Defence Forces, the State only has a limited capacity to contribute to UN Missions. In real terms Ireland has, in the context of its size, punched above its weight and made a valuable, disproportionate contribution and, save for the example of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has not been excluded from peace keeping engagements by the triple lock. On balance, the advantages of retaining the mechanism can be seen as outweighing the disadvantages. Having said that, it is an issue worthy of discussion in advance of the adoption of a new White Paper.</p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following tabular statement.  United Nations peacekeeping operations are deployed on the basis of mandates from the United Nations Security Council. Their roles differ from situation to situation, depending on the nature of the conflict and the specific challenges it presents. Their effectiveness is a matter for the United Nations.<br/><br/>Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations as a member of the UN and the EU. Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations, and supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights. This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system and Ireland remains willing to play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world.<br/><br/>Peacekeeping also adds to our national security by containing conflicts and reducing the threat of conflicts spreading.<br/><br/>The current contribution of some 418 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.<br/><br/><i>AS OF 01 November 2014</i><br/><br/><i>1.

Work on the White Paper on Defence is progressing well. Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands and the types of defence capabilities required to meet these demands. In the course of their deliberations, the Working Groups are taking into consideration the inputs received from a wide variety of stakeholders. This includes the views of international organisations which have been sought with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support operations.</p><p>  Discussions have also been held with a range of other Government Departments on cross-cutting policy issues and likely future demands from Government bodies and State agencies. This includes discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade including on their ongoing review of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and external relations. These discussions are continuing, as required, throughout the White Paper process.</p><p>  I anticipate that an initial draft White Paper will be submitted to me for my consideration by the end of 2014.

I am advised that Lariam is also used by Sweden, Israel, Greece, Canada and Slovenia. The Military Authorities advise that it is a matter for individual Defence Forces to determine whichever malaria chemoprophylaxis it deems most suitable for use. Individual Defence Forces may have regard to the operational commitments and the medical and ancillary support available to its personnel on the ground whilst also taking account of the particular licensing regulations in respect of the drug, pertaining to their jurisdiction.</p><p>  The Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA) formerly the Irish Medicines Board is the statutory authority with responsibility for quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland. The Defence Forces policy in regard to the prescribing of Lariam is in line with current HPRA guidelines. </p><p>  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis. </p><p>  The Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications. Significant precautions are taken by the Medical Corps in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. The choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors. These include the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues. The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  Anti-malarial medications must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

The effective strength of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) for the same date is 2,383, of which 361 (15.15%) are female. The table contains the above mentioned strengths.  The establishment ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force is 9,500. The establishment ceiling of the Reserve Defence Force is 4,069. Recruitment campaigns are under way in order to reach this establishment. Current and future recruitment campaigns have sought to target potential female candidates however the number of females serving in the Defence Forces has remained similar since 2007.<br/><br/>As I outlined in my reply to Question Number 124 of 18 September 2014, the Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<br/><br/>-  The introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,<br/><br/>-  Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,<br/><br/>-  A balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,<br/><br/>-  All promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit,<br/><br/>-  A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. <br/><br/>The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment. Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks. The Military Authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises. <i></i>However, a key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males.<br/><br/>I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that support increased female participation in the Defence Forces. To this end, as part of the recent recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants. These efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and the use of social media. At the closing date for this recruitment campaign on 9 April 2014 there were 755 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,295 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force and 320 female applicants or 14.9% out of a total of 2,146 applicants for the Reserve Defence Force. On the face of it these figures appear to be disappointing. However, I believe that a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers. I am hopeful that through continued engagement and communication, this perception will change over time.<table><tr><th>30-Sep-14 </th><th>TOTAL STRENGTH </th><th>FEMALE STRENGTH <br /><br /></th><th>% FEMALE </th></tr><tr><td>PDF WTE* <br /><br /></td><td>9200 </td><td>556 </td><td>6.04% </td></tr><tr><td>RDF EFFECTIVE** <br /><br /></td><td>2383 </td><td>361 </td><td>15.15% </td></tr></table>*WTE is the Whole Time Equivalent strength which excludes those on Leave of Absence and Secondment.<br/><br/>**The RDF figures provided refer to the Effective strength which excludes Non-Effective personnel.</p></reply>

This re-organisation consolidated under-strength Army Units into a smaller number of full strength Units, within a revised two Brigade structure. Previous structures were officially disestablished at midnight on 29 November 2012. The re-organisation prioritised the operational effectiveness of the PDF within a revised strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel and has ensured that the PDF can continue to discharge all roles assigned by Government.<br/><br/>The detailed PDF organisational blueprint, including establishment strengths for Brigades, individual Units and sub-Units is set out in the Chief of Staff&rsquo;s Administrative Instruction CS4. In the period leading up to 30 November 2012, Administrative Instruction CS4 was based on a PDF strength ceiling of 11,561 personnel. The table below sets out the establishment for Units located in Custume Barracks, Athlone in the period leading up to 30 November 2012. It should be noted that, in order for all posts, as set out in the Administrative Instruction, to be filled, an actual PDF strength level of 11,561 would have been required. This strength level has not been seen since the 1990s.<br/><br/>The White Paper on Defence (2000) reduced the permitted PDF strength ceiling to 10,500 personnel (with up to an additional 250 personnel in training). This meant that just over 1,000 of the posts in the Administrative Instruction CS4, which was intended for a strength level of 11,561 personnel, could not be filled. The permitted PDF strength ceiling was further reduced in October 2010 to 10,000 personnel, meaning that over 1,500 posts in the Administrative Instruction CS4 could not be filled. Following this, the strength level of the PDF continued to decline. In December 2011, the Government decided to stabilise the strength ceiling of the PDF at 9,500 personnel. At this point over 2,000 posts as contained in the then Administrative Instruction CS4, could not be filled. <br/><br/>This highlights two key facts: firstly, the number of posts that could be filled within Units was, since the year 2000, significantly less than the establishment strength of Units as set out in Administrative Instruction CS4 and secondly, this disparity had then more than doubled, arising from strength reductions due to the economic downturn. From 2000 onwards, the disparity required that PDF posts remained unfilled in Units across the Defence Forces, including in Units based in Custume Barracks, Athlone.<br/><br/>For the avoidance of doubt, let me re-iterate that the establishment for Units located in Custume Barracks, Athlone, in the period leading up to 30 November 2012, did not reflect actual jobs in Custume Barracks. It has not done so since the 1990s. In the intervening period, it is the reductions in PDF strength that has reduced the number of jobs available in the PDF. This was not as a result of the re-organisation.<br/><br/>Following the Government&rsquo;s decision to stabilise the strength ceiling of the PDF at 9,500 personnel, it was clear that the then organisational structures were an &ldquo;ill-fit&rdquo; and no longer viable. It was in this context that the then Minister for Defence initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces.<br/><br/>The re-organisation did not significantly alter the actual number of PDF personnel serving in Custume Barracks, Athlone. The military authorities have advised me that in January and February 2011, the months immediately preceding that in which the current Government came into office, there were an average of 1,040 PDF personnel based in Custume Barracks. I am advised by the military authorities that in May 2012, there were 1,051 personnel based at Custume Barracks. On 23 November 2012, there were 865 personnel serving in Units located in Custume Barracks. In accordance with the revised organisational structures, as of 30 November 2012 the establishment for Units based in Custume Barracks is 995 personnel. As at 30 September 2014 (the latest figure available), there were 1,030 personnel based in Custume Barracks. This includes 93 personnel undertaking training courses there.<br/><br/>The effect of the re-organisation on Custume Barracks is that the actual number of PDF personnel based in Custume Barracks has been stabilised at a figure of approximately 1,000 personnel, within an overall strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.<br/><br/>Table - Establishment of Units based in Custume Barrack, as at 23rd November 2012, in accordance with Administrative Instruction CS4 (11,561 PDF personnel).<table><tr><th>PDF Unit* </th><th>Administrative Instruction CS4 (11,561 PDF Personnel) <br /><br />Establishment of those Units located in Custume Barracks up to 30 th November 2012  </th></tr><tr><td>4th Western Brigade Headquarters </td><td>67 </td></tr><tr><td>6 Infantry Battalion </td><td>470 </td></tr><tr><td>4 Field Artillery Regiment </td><td>211 </td></tr><tr><td>4 Cavalry Squadron </td><td>122 </td></tr><tr><td>4 Field Engineer Company </td><td>88 </td></tr><tr><td>4 Field Communication and Information Services Company </td><td>71 </td></tr><tr><td>4 Field Military Police Company </td><td>41 </td></tr><tr><td>4 Logistics Support Battalion </td><td>299 </td></tr><tr><td>4 Brigade Training Centre </td><td>21 </td></tr><tr><td>Band of the 4 W Bde </td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PDF Cadre in RDF Units </td></tr><tr><td>56 Infantry Battalion </td><td>8** </td></tr><tr><td>56 Cavalry Squadron </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>56 Field Engineer Company </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>56 Communications and Information Services Company </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>54 Military Police Company </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL </td><td>1,440 </td></tr></table>*Certain of these Units were not located in Custume Barracks prior to 2009 and 2012.<br/><br/>** 56 Res Infantry Battalion had an establishment of 18 PDF Cadre.

The Pensions Act was amended in 2009 to broaden the options available to the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Act to include the benefits of deferred scheme members and post retirement increases in pension benefits.  Prior to the 2009 Act, only the benefits of active scheme members could be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits. The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 further extended the options available to the trustees of a scheme to include a portion of benefits payable to pensioners. </p><p>  These changes essentially provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.  The issue of how these changes might be applied is a matter for the trustees of a scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries. </p><p>  There are no plans to bring forward further amendments to section 50 of the Pensions Act at this time.</p></reply>

In total, over &euro;822 million is being provided next year for these direct supports, up nearly &euro;17 million from that provided for in 2014. </p><p>  While I have no plans to increase the current annual rate of the RCG from &euro;1,375, I would point out that in the recent Budget, I did announce a number of welfare initiatives which will benefit those, including carers, who are in receipt of a welfare payment. </p><p>  These initiatives included an increase in Child Benefit, an increase in the Living Alone Allowance and support for welfare recipients with the cost of water services. </p><p>  I am also pleased to say that I am in a position to partially restore the Christmas Bonus this year.  A bonus of 25% will be paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients including carers.  This is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households and it is important to note that recipients of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance will also get a bonus. </p><p>  Carers with children will benefit from the increase in child benefit.  There will be an increase in the living alone allowance from January, bringing the rate up to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The living alone allowance was last increased in 1996. </p><p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities, I have introduced a water support payment of &euro;100 to recipients of the Household Benefit Package, to help older people and other vulnerable groups meet the cost of water services.  </p><p>  As well as the measures mentioned above, all existing welfare payments and supports for carers, pensioners and people with disabilities will be maintained in 2015 &ndash; there will be no reductions.</p></reply>

The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the Free Travel Pass and the Social Services Card (SSC) of this Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. </p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a registration process which is called a SAFE registration process.  This involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  Both the PSC and SAFE registration are provided for in primary legislation. </p><p>  The PSC itself securely contains a person's identity dataset on the PSC chip.  The data encoded on the chip is as follows:  Name, Personal Public Service Number (PPSN), Photograph, Signature, Card issue number, Card expiry date, Date of birth, Sex, All former surnames (if any) of mother, Place of birth, All former surnames (if any), Nationality. </p><p>  A subset of this data is also stored on the face of the card:  Name, PPSN, Photograph, Signature, Card issue number, and Card expiry date. </p><p>  The Department is committed to protecting the rights and privacy of individuals in accordance with the Data Protection Acts.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was consulted and involved in card design discussions.  The card has multiple protection mechanisms, all of the highest current international standards, to prevent and detect tampering with the physical card and its contents.  As well as some hidden security features, the card contains visual measures such as its overall graphical design, branding, microprinting, use of optical variable ink and a kinegram.  In addition, a PSC and a card reader will communicate with each other by cryptographic means.  Only card readers specifically programmed to accept PSCs can undertake this functionality. </p><p>  The SAFE registration process and the roll-out of the PSC holds a number of benefits for the customers, the Department and for other Public Service bodies. These include improvement in existing cards (e.g. Social Services Cards and Free Travel) through better security features, considerably reducing the potential for forgery and fraudulent use, a reduction in the rate of fraud and errors caused by incorrectly identified and authenticated people, and improvement in the efficiency of every service delivered by the State through the removal of the duplication caused by multiple agencies each solving the problem of identity and authentication themselves. </p><p>  The introduction of the card, in addition to providing a more efficient service for customers, is also helping to deter and prevent irregularities, including identity theft.  The Department has deployed facial image matching software to help detect and deter duplicate SAFE registrations.  This has led to the identification of 39 cases (individuals) of facial matches with some prosecutions pending as a result. </p></reply>

Up until 16th January 2012, certain social welfare payments could be retained in part or in full when participating on CE. The CE personal rate of &euro;208.00 was applicable to these participants (as any dependants were covered under the original social welfare payment). <br/><br/>These who retained social welfare payments included:<br/><br/>- One Parent Family Payment (partially retained)<br/><br/>- Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit (fully retained)<br/><br/>- Widow(er)s Pension (fully retained)<br/><br/>- Illness Benefit (fully retained)<br/><br/>- Disability Allowance (partially retained)<br/><br/>- Invalidity Pension (fully retained)<br/><br/>- Blind Pension (partially retained)<br/><br/>As part of Budget 2012, new entrants to CE were disqualified from simultaneously receiving their original social welfare payment and CE allowances with effect from Monday 16th January 2012. From that date, participants receive CE allowances only at a rate equivalent to their scheduled social welfare payment, plus &euro;20, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;208.00 per week. This disqualification was enacted under Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 2011. <br/><br/>For those participants already engaged on CE at the time of the introduction of this measure, it was possible to retain their dual payments under a saver clause in the above legislation. The Department is currently considering this matter and is in the process of collating data on claimants who are currently in receipt of dual payments and will respond in due course to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). HAP will provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.  Rent supplement will continue to be paid to those already in the private rented sector who have a short-term need of rental support, often as a result of the loss of employment. </p><p>  HAP was introduced in Cork County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council on 15th September, 2014 and in South Dublin County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council on 1st October, 2014. </p><p>  To date, over 160 customers have been taken onto the HAP scheme, which includes both direct transfers from the rent supplement scheme and new applicants that have being assessed as qualifying for social housing support by the local authority. Prior to the introduction of HAP, new applicants qualifying for social housing support were eligible for rent supplement. The Department is requesting rent supplement recipients, who have been in receipt of the supplement for periods in excess of 18 months, to apply to the housing authority for a social housing assessment and as a consequence, an assessment for social housing support including HAP. </p><p>  Department of Social Protection officials are continuing to work closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to support the implementation of HAP within the selected local authorities.</p></reply>

The renewed focus on the development of individuals on schemes is leading to greater achievements for the learner and an improved service to local communities across the country. The putting in place of an Individual Learner Plan some years ago has added to this achievement. The role of the Sponsoring Organisation and the CE Supervisor in the provision of guidance and support is critical to achieving positive outcomes.  With this in mind, the Department provides funding for the employment of supervisors on a 39 hour week basis, while the participants participation on the scheme is for 19.5 hours.  This is in order to provide adequate time to the sponsoring organisation to provide the necessary supports for the daily management of the scheme.   </p><p>  There are two monitoring visits carried out by the Department to a scheme on an annual basis &ndash; financial monitoring and programme monitoring which focus on gaining evidence from the scheme of compliance with the CE Operational Procedures.  Each scheme is notified by the Department well in advance of what is expected from them so that it is made as easy as possible for the scheme to become compliant.  The scheme itself has no paperwork to complete.  The monitoring form is completed by officials from the Department.  If the scheme is found not to be fully compliant, every assistance is provided by the Department in order to become so.  </p><p>  The average fund provided to CE schemes is in the region of &euro;350,000 per annum, which is a significant outlay by the Department.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that robust controls and monitoring are required to ensure that public monies are being spent in an effective and efficient manner.</p></reply>

The purpose of this is to ensure that the CE participant benefits from the programme and is assured of getting a quality service.</p><p>  In relation to follow-up with CE participants, this is to ensure that there is a smooth  transition from the programme and that a level of support is still provided to the individual.    It was always the role of the CE scheme and supervisor to support the job search of the CE participant &ndash; particularly when coming up to leaving the scheme. This arrangement was formalised in special agreements which were put in place under Benchmarking, Sustaining Progress and T16 awards for CE Supervisors.  These conditions were agreed in consultation with the representative bodies at the time and were widely circulated to schemes.</p></reply>

Funding in 2015 will increase to &euro;379m to accommodate the full complement of places. <br/><br/>Also an additional &euro;1.3m was allocated to the CE training budget in 2013 in order to support the provision of training to participants.  This additional funding has been retained for 2014 and 2015.<br/><br/>The <b><i>nominal</i></b>training grant per CE participant place is &euro;250 per year but this can extend up to &euro;500 depending on an individual participant&rsquo;s training needs. The training grant is paid to the CE sponsor and is used according to participant needs (some may use more than this, as above, some use less, as certain training is provided free of charge by the Local Education and Training Boards). It is up to the sponsor to maximise the utilisation of the training grant for all its participants. <br/><br/>With regards to CE duration, the current rules regarding maximum durations have not changed.  With effect from 3<sup>rd</sup>April 2000, lifetime cumulative participation on CE by an individual is limited to:<br/><br/>- 3 years (156 weeks) for persons under 55 years of age.<br/><br/>- 6 years (312 weeks) for persons of 55 years of age up to and including 65 years of age.<br/><br/>- Eligible persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked Social Welfare payment will be eligible for one additional year on CE over the standard maximum participation caps, i.e. 4 years cumulative maximum time on CE for those under 55 years of age (Part-Time Job Option only), and 7 years cumulative maximum time for those between 55 and 65 (Part-Time Job Option only  ).<br/><br/>Participation on CE prior to 3<sup>rd</sup>April 2000 is not counted. Offshore island residents are exempt from this participation cap, subject to the availability of places on island-based CE schemes.</p></reply>

There are approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  The Department is undertaking a review of the maximum rent limits. </p><p>  I am concerned that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients. Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience and make every effort to ensure that accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers, as necessary.

You will be aware that a range of legislative measures have been put in place over a number of years to assist both employers and trustees of pension schemes to respond to these difficulties and to achieve a sustainable pension provision for all scheme members and beneficiaries.</p><p>  Section 48 of the Pensions Act sets out the order (wind up priority order) in which the assets of a defined benefits pension scheme are distributed in the event of the wind up of a scheme. The wind up priority order was amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act in 2013. Prior to these changes pensioner benefits were given priority over the benefits of active and deferred scheme members. The recent changes to the wind up priority order essentially de-prioritises a portion of pensioner benefits in the manner in which the resource of a scheme are distributed on the windup of a pension scheme. These changes make more resources of the scheme available in the initial distribution of assets to active and deferred scheme members. The impact of these changes will be determined by the level of funding in a pension scheme at the time of the wind up. </p><p>  The matter of the date from which the provisions in the Social Welfare Pensions (No.2) Act would apply was considered in preparing the legislation.  However, based on advice received, the revised provisions can only apply to defined benefits pension schemes which have commenced wind up after the legislation has been enacted.</p><p>  You will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on issues relating to a particular pension scheme as these are a matter for the companies involved and the trustees of the pension scheme. </p></reply>

Previous DIRT rates were below the higher rate of income tax, and this, in effect, incentivised saving.  The decision to raise the rate of DIRT was taken to encourage spending in the economy with a view to stimulating growth and employment.<br/><br/>Certain exemptions apply from DIRT, the main ones include:<br/><br/>- Individuals aged over 65 (subject to income limits)<br/><br/>- Permanently Incapacitated Individuals<br/><br/>- Companies, Pension Funds and Charities (Irish resident companies pay tax on investment income at 25%)<br/><br/>- Non-Resident Account Holders<br/><br/>There are alternative savings products available which are tax free (Savings Bonds, Saving Certificates, Instalment Savings and the National Solidarity Bonds).<br/><br/>Over a longer term, pension savings are encouraged by the exemption from taxation  at the marginal income tax rate of ongoing contributions by individuals (subject to annual limits which increase with age). Investment growth of pension savings are also tax exempt while pension benefits are taxed on drawdown at marginal rates subject to a tax-free retirement lump sum up to a life-time maximum of &euro;200,000.  </p></reply>

Her entitlement to such a deferral arises from her income threshold level.</p><p>  However, where such a DAS arrangement takes a person's weekly amount below the 'de minimis' threshold of &euro;186, then deduction of the full liability can not take place. This 'de minimus' amount is enshrined in Social Welfare legislation and it was considered, at the time of the introduction of LPT, that it was not appropriate to change the law in this regard.  In such circumstances property owners usually avail of one of the other payment options to meet the outstanding balance not covered by the DAS arrangement. From Revenue's analysis of these types of situations it seems that most people prefer to use the Payment Service Provider (PSP) option on a phased basis to meet the shortfall. For the Deputy's information the approved PSP's associated with this option are, An Post, Omnivend, Payzone and Paypoint.   </p><p>  Given the circumstances of the case, a member of the LPT team has already made contact with the person in question. The LPT team member firstly clarified the concept of Partial Deferral for her, particularly in respect of threshold limits and how it (the amount deferred), including interest at a rate of 4% attaches as a charge to the property. The team member also confirmed that any such charge would have to be satisfied before any future sale or transfer could be completed.</p><p>  The LPT team member then outlined the various alternative payment options that are available to her in addition to DAS and on the basis of the conversation the person opted to meet the balance of her 2014 liability through a PSP over the remaining weeks of the year. The transaction charges in respect of the various PSP's were also outlined during the conversation. </p><p>  Finally, Revenue has assured me that the person's LPT obligations are now being fully met and are operating in a manner that suits her individual circumstances. </p></reply>

The most recent survey, undertaken in 2013, indicated that 11% of the cigarettes consumed in Ireland were illicit, and that a further 5% were non Irish duty paid which were legally brought into the country. The comparable figures for illicit cigarettes in 2012 and 2011 were 13% and 14% respectively, with the legally imported non Irish duty paid cigarettes at 6% and 7%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling, distribution and sale of illicit product.</p><p>  An additional survey was conducted in 2013 to ascertain the incidence of illicit packs of &quot;roll your own&quot; tobacco. The survey found that 15% of the packs held by smokers surveyed were illicit, and that a further 2% were legal Non-Irish Duty Paid.</p><p>  A further survey is being undertaken this year and it is expected that the results will be available towards the end of the first quarter in 2015.</p><p>  I am advised also that combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for Revenue. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes on-going analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved by Revenue through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  Revenue cooperates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the on-going programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p><p>  I am assured that the commitment to acting against all stages of the supply chain for illicit products will be maintained and that Revenue will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-13a.193.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014111300030#WRH00300"><p>I wish to refer the deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Question No. 271 of the 04/11/2014, Ref No: 40988/14, in which I stated that I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that the provision of a quality customer service to taxpayers is a key corporate priority for Revenue.  Revenue is committed to ensuring that their service for all customers is suitably tailored to meet demand levels and that a range of speedy and efficient contact channels for customers is available. In addition, Revenue is committed to ensuring that the delivery of their customer service is as cost effective as possible for the Exchequer, having regard to the resources available and the need to balance the deployment of resources between service provision and the further key corporate priority of tackling non-compliance with tax and duty obligations.<br/><br/>In recent years, despite budgetary and resource constraints, Revenue has improved the delivery of customer services. In particular, Revenue's PAYE Anytime service is used by thousands of customers to conduct their business with Revenue. Revenue's On-Line Service (ROS) provides a similarly efficient service for business tax customers.  These on-line services (available at .) are designed to provide customers with quick, convenient and cost-effective ways of conducting business with Revenue.<br/><br/>Revenue is also fully committed to providing a quality service to those customers whose preference is to deal with them in person, for example:<br/><br/>- a regionalised lo-call telephone service is available for PAYE taxpayers.  The Dublin Region contact number is 1890 333 425, and the contact numbers for the other Regions are available on www.revenue.ie.  There are also phone helplines for business taxpayers and the respective contact details are communicated directly to those taxpayers, and are also easily accessible on .  <br/><br/>- a correspondence service, with contact addresses for the respective Tax Districts also on www.revenue.ie.<br/><br/>- in the Dublin area, the Central Revenue Information Office (CRIO) has state-of-the-art facilities for dealing with customers who wish to carry out transactions face to face with a Revenue staff member.  The CRIO is located at O'Connell St./Cathedral St., Dublin 1, and is open from 8.30 a.m. to 4.00 p.m, Monday to Friday.  The CRIO is convenient to all of the main public transport routes into Dublin city, and it has the capacity to deal with the current demand level for &quot;walk-in&quot; counter services by Revenue customers in the greater Dublin area.<br/><br/>As with any modern service provider, the Deputy will appreciate that good business practice requires Revenue to constantly review service delivery to ensure that they have the correct balance across the channels to suit demand levels and changing customer preferences.  Accordingly, the opening hours of public offices and telephone services are subject to ongoing review in order to most effectively meet peaks and troughs of customer demand levels.<br/><br/>The vast majority of customers in Revenue's public offices have relatively straight forward informational enquiries, or wish to carry out routine transactions such as claiming tax credits or refunds.  These transactions can be carried out much more effectively on-line or by telephone.  With this increasing uptake in on-line and telephone transactions, the demand level in the Tallaght Revenue Information Office (TRIO) has been steadily declining, with a reduction of some 50% in the number of customers in recent years.  The opening hours of the office have accordingly been adjusted in tandem with the reduced demand and in that context the office closed on 5 August last and reopened on 15 October.<br/><br/>In the lead-up to the closure, every effort was made to ensure that there would be no reduction in the quality of service to customers:<br/><br/>- Public notices were placed in TRIO to ensure customer awareness and to highlight the service alternatives;<br/><br/>- The TRIO staff liaised with the Tallaght Citizens Information Office and supplied that office with the most popular tax forms and leaflets;<br/><br/>- TRIO staff also pro-actively liaised with other local agencies and large local employers to advise them about the August closure and alternatives services to meet their needs.<br/><br/>Revenue is confident that customers in Tallaght will continue to receive the same high levels of customer service and the Dublin South County Tax District has been closely monitoring contacts from their customers.  In that context, it should be noted that with a view to managing a peak customer demand in the run up to the pay and file deadline for self assessed taxpayers, and the local property tax pay and file campaign, TRIO reopened on 15 October last to provide a morning only service from Wednesday to Friday, 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m.  The ongoing provision of the TRIO service will kept under continuous review, having regard to demand for the service, seasonal or otherwise, the availability of resources and the need to balance the deployment of resources across the range of customer service and compliance functions.</p></reply>

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  The MoU came into effect on 1 July, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to Insurance Ireland in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  Work is ongoing to prepare further data sets on completed flood defence schemes for transfer to Insurance Ireland. The arrangements set out in the MoU represent an ongoing process which, over time, should lead to an improvement in the availability of flood insurance cover. The MoU and further information on the process is available on the OPW website www.opw.ie</p><p>  This provision of information to Insurance Ireland on completed flood relief schemes in the context of the MoU is separate from the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  Under this programme, detailed flood hazard maps for 300 at risk communities throughout the country are being produced which, following public consultation, will be made available publicly. Insurance companies will have access to the maps and to the information they contain in relation to flood risk.  A series of informal public consultations is now under way on the draft flood hazard maps.  A statutory public consultation process will commence shortly, leading to the finalisation of the maps and the development of draft Catchment Flood Risk Management Plans later in 2015.  These Plans will include an examination of all possible options to address the flood risk in the location in question and will recommend an integrated set of measures, both structural and non-structural, as appropriate, to deal with and manage the risk.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works has no role or function in relation to oversight or regulation of the insurance industry.  Any question of mandatory flood insurance would be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

They pull together all the players &ndash; other Government Departments and Agencies - to support everyone with a good business idea and strengthen the enterprise sector in the local area.  The LEOs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business. Contact details for the LEOs are available at .<br/><br/>The LEOs themselves provide a range of financial and non-financial supports to help enterprises at start-up or during business expansion phases.  It should be noted that the LEOs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.  However, there are other potential supports available and the LEO staff can advise appropriately.  <br/><br/>For example, the LEO can advise clients about the Department of Social Protection JobsPlus Scheme, which<b></b>is an incentive aimed at encouraging and rewarding employers who offer employment opportunities to the long term unemployed. Grants up to &euro;10,000 are available to qualifying employers to offset wage costs where they engage jobseekers from the Live Register.<br/><br/>In addition, any business can use the LEOs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund available to MFI has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local LEO. Further information can be found on .<br/><br/>Businesses can also access the new online search tool for SME business supports that was launched last May. The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-governmental initiative to help Irish start-ups and small businesses navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible. <br/><br/>By answering the eight questions in the Tool, a small business will, in one location be able to:<br/><br/>- Find out which of the over 80 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them<br/><br/>- obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit<br/><br/>- identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further<br/><br/>- download all these filtered results into a document for their further use.<br/><br/>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at: <br/><br/>.</p></reply>

The Action Plan has set a target of having 100,000 more people at work by 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people in employment by 2020.  The focus of the APJ is to  build Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage; assist indigenous business to grow; drive entrepreneurship and start-up companies; support employment at community and local level; develop and deepen the impact of FDI; and also to exploit sectoral opportunities.  The Agriculture, Food and the Marine sectors feature prominently in each Action Plan with a broad suite of actions targeted at job creation in those areas.  The Action Plan for Jobs does not specifically refer to the sugar industry.</p><p>  The Action Plans are developed through a highly consultative process across the public and private sector, including engagement with enterprise, employers, employees and those currently unemployed.  This engagement is used to invite proposals from stakeholder groups and also to ensure that the right actions are prioritised. In addition, each Government Department and their associated agencies are invited to submit proposals for inclusion in the Action Plans.</p></reply>

Modulation reduction of 10% which applied in 2013 was not applied in 2014.   </p><p>  The practice of applying modulation reductions to the single payment received by farmers was in place from 2005-2013.  A new EU financial framework is in place for the period 2014-2020.  Under this framework, new national ceilings were set for all member states.  As modulation was no longer a feature of the new framework, it was necessary to adjust the value of entitlements to individual farmers to correspond with the national ceiling.   </p><p>  This regulation also provided the option for a member state to decide not to reduce payment entitlements activated in 2013 by farmers who, in 2013, claimed less than an amount to be determined by the Member State concerned, which may not exceed &euro;5000.  Ireland decided to implement this provision to a maximum of &euro;5000.  Accordingly, in order to comply with Ireland&rsquo;s national ceiling, it was necessary to apply a linear reduction of 10.49% to all other payment entitlements.</p></reply>

In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar/bioethanol facility in the country.  The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicate that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed.  I informed both groups at the time and many times since in the D&aacute;il and through the media, that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I clearly informed both groups at the time that it was my job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.   </p><p>  In this connection, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the last EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. </p><p>  At the time, this agreement was welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.  It is now up to those same entities to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.  I hope this explains the position.</p></reply>

Eligibility checks are required to ensure that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that there are no dual claims of land and that ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes.  Both the administrative and inspection checks ensure that the Land Parcel Identification System, underpinning the direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5bn annually, is accurately maintained.  In addition, these checks are required to protect the annual drawdown of the EU funds and to avoid disallowances. <br/><br/>My Department is required to carry out an annual round of inspections, both in the field and by means of Remote Sensing, to ensure the eligibility of land declared to draw down payments.  The basis of these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are minimum numbers that must be conducted each year.<br/><br/>Land eligibility checks must be carried out on at least 5% of applicants.  In response to concerns about the impact of on-the-ground inspections on farmers, 6,715 cases or some 85% of the required 2014 inspections are initially being carried out without the need for a farm visit as the information needed is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite. <br/><br/>The EU Regulations governing Remote Sensing inspections also require that where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the available satellite imagery, a field inspection must be undertaken to verify the eligibility of the land.<br/><br/>To date inspection results have been received and processed for 5,762 of the 6,715 cases selected for a remote sensing inspection.

However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that tax policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture.  In this regard I am pleased that the Minister and I could facilitate the Agri-taxation Review, which was published as part Budget 2015.  It gave us a unique opportunity to examine a critical element of Government support to the agriculture sector in the context of the strategy of expansion and increasing exports under Food Harvest 2020.  The Review provides a strong evidence base for continued assistance to the primary sector through taxation measures and it is a clear strategy with specific policy objectives for the future.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture is evidenced by the immediate implementation of the majority of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in Budget 2015, including 12 new measures, which form part of a strategic policy response to the opportunities and challenges ahead.<br/><br/>One of the taxation policy objectives identified by the Review is to assist succession. The age profile of Irish farmers is increasing and it is recognised that there are many social and economic reasons why succession management is a challenge for farmers. Assisting succession and the transfer of farms has been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s agri-taxation policy and Budget 2015 included a number of measures to maintain and strengthen that support, specifically:<br/><br/>-The retention and targeting of Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax to active farmers or to those who lease out land long-term.<br/><br/>-The retention and enhancement of Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax, including two new measures:<br/><br/>-The extension of the eligible letting period of a qualifying asset to 25 years.<br/><br/>-For transfers other than to a child under Retirement Relief, as a once-off measure until the end of 2016, the inclusion of conacre lettings as eligible.<br/><br/>- The retention of the current stamp duty exemptions on transfers of land, including the extension of Stamp Duty Consanguinity Relief, i.e. relief to related persons, on non-residential transfers to the end of 2017.<br/><br/>I am confident that the package of measures introduced in Budget 2015, the most substantial package of this kind ever introduced in a single budget, will lead to a more efficient and productive sector. <br/><br/>These and other taxation measures to assist succession do not discriminate against family members.</p></reply>

At an EU level, two distinct camps can be identified; those for whom the Russian ban has an immediate and substantial effect and other countries mostly in Western Europe where the effects are less immediate.  The Russian ban continues to have an acute effect for the Baltic Countries and Finland in particular.  Member States, such as Ireland, who have lower dairy exports to Russia are affected indirectly as additional product is now available on EU and global markets.  The volume of total EU product displaced as a result of the Russian ban is less significant when viewed in terms of total production, but is quite substantial in terms of the impact on the overall traded sector for EU dairy produce.  In this respect the Russian ban can be seen to have exacerbated an already softening global dairy outlook with an increasing supply profile which is not matched by increases in demand.  I have emphasised at one meeting of the Council of Ministers that this is an EU wide problem which requires an EU wide response. </p><p>  The Russian ban has been discussed on a number of occasions at Council, including at an Extraordinary Council meeting organised by the Italian Presidency in early October.  The Private Storage Aid schemes for butter, cheese and SMP, which I fully supported were introduced in September.  This measure is currently suspended for cheese as the uptake was not in the main from Russian ban affected countries.  Whilst the long-term fundamentals of global dairy market are strong and the EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from expanding global population and demand current forecasts suggest we are facing into a period of medium term price volatility arising from, inter alia, the Russian Ban.  In this context I have called for the deployment of all available market tools as appropriate.   </p><p>  I have also made it clear that EU agriculture should not be disproportionately affected by a decision based on EU foreign and security policy considerations and the costs of addressing the resultant market imbalance should not be borne solely by the CAP budget.   </p><p>  My opinion is that based on appropriate and timely market analysis the preference should be clearly biased towards a pre-emptive rather than a reactionary response in terms of ensuring that the Irish and EU dairy sector can continue to remain competitive globally.  I believe that there are an exceptional set of circumstances influencing matters right now and therefore exceptional responses should be considered.  I expect that this issue will continue to feature heavily on the Council of Ministers' agenda over the medium term until such time as a solution is forthcoming.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces Medical Corps is advised that the three anti-malarial medications licensed by the HPRA &ndash; Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline &ndash; can all have significant side effects and protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.</p><p>  Each of the three drugs has been used by the Defence Forces, depending on individual circumstances including the type of malaria in the destination, the duration of travel, etc.  Where malaria has been identified as a risk in a particular mission area, the choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues. The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces on the basis of best international practice having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  I am advised that the Defence Forces follow policy in line with current HPRA guidelines, in prescribing Lariam. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis. This is intended to rule out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions, e.g. depression, anxiety, pregnancy, neurodegenerative disorders etc. which, as has been indicated by the Health Product Regulatory Authority, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.</p><p>  I am advised that the allegation of a link between Lariam and suicide / suicide ideation has been examined. Of 156 non-service related deaths among members of the Defence Forces in the period January 2000 to December 2010, 25 were apparently from self-inflicted injuries, although only one is recorded by a coroner as &ldquo;suicide&rdquo;. Of these 25 deaths, 16 had never been prescribed Lariam. Of the remaining 9, given the limited period of time during which Lariam remains in the bloodstream, according to our expert advice, it is extremely unlikely that Lariam could have been a contributory factor in practically all of these cases. There is no evidence in any of the coroners&rsquo; inquests linking any deaths to Lariam.</p><p>  The death rate in the Defence Forces from self-inflicted injuries in the period 2000 to 2010, when Lariam was being prescribed, was 0.24%. The death rate from self-inflicted injuries in the period 1989 &ndash; to 1999, when Lariam was not being prescribed, was 0.32% which is higher than the death rate in the period when Lariam was being prescribed.</p><p>  Former Ministers for Defence have had the various concerns surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations, and supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights. This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system and Ireland remains willing to play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world. The Defence Forces are currently primarily deployed on overseas missions in support of international peace and security under UN mandates. However, with the increased use of more robust Chapter VII missions, the UN has turned to regional organisations such as the EU, the African Union and NATO to manage operations on its behalf and under its authority. This is one of the most significant changes in relation to UN efforts at maintaining international peace and security. In effect the EU and NATO, together with other similar such organisations, are now major players in UN peacekeeping.  Peacekeeping also adds to Ireland&rsquo;s national security by containing conflicts and reducing the threat of conflicts spreading. UN peacekeeping missions, such as UNIFIL, has made a real difference in countries such as Lebanon. The UNIFIL operation has supported political transitions and helped the region to close the chapter of conflict and open a path to normal development, even if major peace building challenges remain.</p></reply>

Rates of remuneration and conditions of employment in the Irish public sector have traditionally been set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various sectors of the Irish public sector.

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2013 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (Haddington Road Agreement) define current pay policy.</p><p>  In the Haddington Road Agreement the Government reaffirmed its commitment that public service pay and any related issues will not be revisited over the lifetime of the Agreement, subject to compliance with the terms of the Agreement.

Of the measures applying to the Defence Forces in the Haddington Road Agreement, the following may apply to enlisted personnel depending on their duties:</p><p>- Incorporation of duties attracting Technical Group 1 pay into standard duties for new enlisted personnel.</p><p>- Flat rating Security Duty Allowance and related payments at the standard weekday rate.</p><p>- A 10% Reduction in certain Defence Force s   Allowances.</p><p>- Voluntary buyout of Border Duty Allowance for enlisted personnel.</p><p>- Implementation of additional incremental points in pay scales for new enlisted personnel post 01 July 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for members of the PDF provides a formal mechanism for the PDF Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service. Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel. The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments. It is of course open to the Representative Associations of the members of the PDF, subject to the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and the Haddington Road Agreement, to avail of the mechanisms in place should they wish to pursue any particular concerns in relation to the pay and conditions of their members.</p></reply>

The individual&rsquo;s solicitors were invited to make representations on his behalf and detailed representations were subsequently made. A fresh examination of the matter was undertaken and all aspects of the case including, in particular, the representations made by the solicitors were fully considered by the then Minister for Defence and a new <i>bona fide</i>decision was made. It was decided to take the total civil compensation received by the person in question into consideration and the disability pension was accordingly reduced.<br/><br/>While the High Court Order quashed the original decision of March 1987 and ordered that a new review of the case be undertaken, the court did not express any view as to the outcome of the review. The Order did not preclude the then Minister for Defence from arriving at the same decision and I do not believe that the decision made was in conflict with the High Court Order.<br/><br/>I am satisfied that the disability pension in this case has been properly determined in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.</p></reply>

In relation to the figures in the table, the serving strength figures for 2013 and 2014 are the Whole Time Equivalent strengths of Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. The fluctuation in strength is based on the serving strength at the end of the preceding year.  The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service.<br/><br/>Targeted recruitment has been, and is currently, taking place so as to maintain the level of 9,500 personnel and to ensure the ongoing deployable capacity of the Defence Forces on operations. To this end, a new General Service Recruitment competition was launched in March 2014. Recruitment from the panels established under this competition commenced on 18 August, 2014. Of the 441 Recruits enlisted to the Permanent Defence Force (both Army and Navy) since then 385 remain in training. There are 37 cadets in training and 15 Apprentice Aircraft Technicians have been recruited to the Air Corps.<br/><br/>Targeted General Service recruitment will continue in 2015 from the recruitment panels formed from the current competition. It is planned that these panels will remain in place until they are exhausted in 2015. With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks assigned by Government both at home and overseas.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>31-Dec-10 </th><th>31-Dec-11 </th><th>31-Dec-12 </th><th>31-Dec-13 </th><th>30-Sep-14 </th></tr><tr><td>SERVING ARMY STRENGTH </td><td>7752 </td><td>7650 </td><td>7510 </td><td>7434 </td><td>7413 </td></tr><tr><td>SERVING AIR CORPS STRENGTH </td><td>766 </td><td>791 </td><td>791 </td><td>779 </td><td>757 </td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SERVING NAVAL SERVICE STRENGTH </td><td>1032 </td><td>997 </td><td>1058 </td><td>1023 </td><td>1030 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL </td><td>9,550 </td><td>9,438 </td><td>9,359 </td><td>9,236 </td><td>9,200 <br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This comprises 7,413 Army, 757 Air Corps and 1030 Naval Service. 556 (6.04%) are women. The following tables contain the above mentioned strength broken down into Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by gender and rank groupings.  The establishment ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force is 9,500. Recruitment campaigns are under way in order to reach this establishment. Current and future recruitment campaigns have sought to target potential female candidates.<br/><br/>As I outlined in my reply to Question Number 124 of 18 September 2014, the Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<br/><br/>-  The introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,<br/><br/>-  Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,<br/><br/>-  A balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,<br/><br/>-  All promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit,<br/><br/>-  A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.<br/><br/>The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment. Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks. The Military Authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises. However, a key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males.<br/><br/>  I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that support increased female participation in the Defence Forces. To this end, as part of the recent recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants. These efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and the use of social media. At the closing date for this recruitment campaign on 9 April 2014 there were 755 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,295 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force. On the face of it these figures appear to be disappointing. However, I believe that a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers. I am hopeful that through continued engagement and communication, this perception will change over time.<br/><br/>Army (PDF)<table><tr><th>Rank </th><th>Male </th><th>Female </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Lt Gen </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Maj Gen </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Brig Gen </td><td>6 </td><td>0 </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>Col </td><td>33 </td><td>0 </td><td>33 </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Col </td><td>100 </td><td>3 </td><td>103 </td></tr><tr><td>Comdt </td><td>219 </td><td>25 </td><td>244 </td></tr><tr><td>Captain </td><td>254 </td><td>43 </td><td>297 </td></tr><tr><td>LT </td><td>190 </td><td>36 </td><td>226 </td></tr><tr><td>SM </td><td>26 </td><td>0 </td><td>26 </td></tr><tr><td>BQMS </td><td>33 </td><td>0 </td><td>33 </td></tr><tr><td>CS </td><td>106 </td><td>1 </td><td>107 </td></tr><tr><td>CQMS </td><td>162 </td><td>1 </td><td>163 </td></tr><tr><td>Sgt </td><td>825 </td><td>54 </td><td>879 </td></tr><tr><td>Cpl </td><td>1,238 </td><td>115 </td><td>1353 </td></tr><tr><td>Pte </td><td>3,745 </td><td>176 </td><td>3921 </td></tr><tr><td>Cadets </td><td>16 </td><td>3 </td><td>19 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>6,956 </td><td>457 </td><td>7,413 </td></tr></table><br/><br/>Air Corps (PDF)<table><tr><th>Rank </th><th>Male </th><th>Female </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Lt Gen </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Maj Gen </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Brig Gen </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Col </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Col </td><td>12 </td><td>0 </td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td>Comdt </td><td>32 </td><td>0 </td><td>32 </td></tr><tr><td>Captain </td><td>44 </td><td>6 </td><td>50 </td></tr><tr><td>LT </td><td>29 </td><td>1 </td><td>30 </td></tr><tr><td>SM </td><td>7 </td><td>1 </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>BQMS </td><td>4 </td><td>0 </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>CS </td><td>47 </td><td>0 </td><td>47 </td></tr><tr><td>CQMS </td><td>14 </td><td>0 </td><td>14 </td></tr><tr><td>Sgt </td><td>119 </td><td>6 </td><td>125 </td></tr><tr><td>Cpl </td><td>151 </td><td>12 </td><td>163 </td></tr><tr><td>Pte </td><td>237 </td><td>9 </td><td>246 </td></tr><tr><td>Cadets </td><td>23 </td><td>0 </td><td>23 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>722 </td><td>35 </td><td>757 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Discussions have been taking place with the Representative  Association, with regards to their claim, under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<br/><br/>As Military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals it is necessary that its members be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and to undertake their duties on deployment overseas<font color="#555555">.  </font>It is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. As such, in order to maintain the age profile of the PDF to carry out the operational tasks required by Government, it is necessary to have a constant input of recruits into the PDF. The maximum age for personnel who have enlisted in the PDF post 1 January 1994 provides the mechanism through which a satisfactory age profile can be achieved.<br/><br/>However, while there was significant progress made in discussions between PDFORRA and Civil and Military Management it was not possible to reach full agreement. As a result, the issue is being referred to third party adjudication for a ruling. It is expected that the adjudication hearing will take place in the next few weeks following the exchange of submissions between the parties.<br/><br/>In the meantime work is continuing on measures to support those exiting. A number of military courses are already accredited with various Third Level Institutions. While a comprehensive training course to aid Transition to Civilian Life for these personnel is currently being piloted.</p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following tabular statement.<br/><br/>The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 191 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 138 Defence Forces personnel. Small numbers of Defence Forces personnel are also deployed to missions in Mali, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Ireland also contributes observers to various United Nations and OSCE missions, to the Nordic Battle group headquarters in Sweden and other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.<br/><br/>The most recent request for the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas was from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Emergency Civilian Assistance Team (ECAT) Initiative to assist in Ireland&rsquo;s response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Three members of the Permanent Defence Force are being deployed to the Embassy of Ireland in Sierra Leone. These personnel will bring key technical skills to enhance the embassy's ability to respond to the crisis.<br/><br/>Consideration is also being given to the possible deployment of a small number of Defence Forces personnel to be embedded as part of a UK Armed Forces Treatment Unit in Kerrytown, Sierra Leone.  Discussions are ongoing in this regard between the Irish and UK authorities.<br/><br/>Apart from the above deployments, no other new deployments are planned or envisaged at this time.<br/><br/>The current contribution of some 418 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.<br/><br/><i>AS OF 01 November 2014</i><table><tr><th>1. </th><th>UN MISSIONS </th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) 45 th Infantry Group </td><td>191 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel, Syria &amp;amp; Lebanon </td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast) </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) Golan Heights Syria </td><td>138 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL </td><td>350 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EUFOR (EU led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina) </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EUTM Mali (EU led Training Mission) </td><td>10 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ </td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan) </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS </td><td>386 </td></tr><tr><td>2. </td><td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE) </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group Vienna </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING OSCE </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>3. </td><td>EU MILITARY STAFF </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Brussels </td><td>5 </td></tr><tr><td>4. </td><td>NORDIC BATTLE GROUP 2015 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FHQ Sweden </td><td>14 </td></tr><tr><td>5. </td><td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Military Adviser Irish delegation to OSCE, Vienna </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Military Representative to EU (Brussels) </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels) </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS </td><td>418 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In response to these resource constraints, the Defence Organisation has undertaken further significant reorganisation and reform. These changes will ensure that the Defence Forces organisational structures are configured to maximize required capabilities. </p><p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence and is a matter that is kept under constant review. The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades. </p><p>  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces. </p><p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment.  This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces training methods and standards within an international military context.   </p><p>I am also satisfied that Naval Service training techniques and technologies are up to date in all respects, with the most up to date equipment, including modern technology and IT equipment available to Naval Service personnel. With the delivery this year of the LE Samuel Beckett and forthcoming delivery of two new off shore patrol vessels in 2015 and 2016, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, the Naval Service will continue to meet the required operational capability. The Air Corps will continue to conduct its training in accordance with industry best practices and to the highest standards using the most modern methods and equipment available.</p></reply>

Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills to permit the development of organisational capabilities. Career training provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels from Section Commander to Brigade Commander. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together. This moulds Sub-Units, Units and Formations into integrated and coherent combat forces. This provides the Defence Forces with the capabilities required to fulfil its roles and missions, both at home and overseas. </p><p>  The Defence Forces delivers military programmes and modules meeting National and International standards encompassing both academic and military best practice. The Defence Forces also engages with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, ensures that the Defence Forces retains currency with regards to best international practice. This commitment ensures that the Defence Forces continues to maintain interoperable staffs and forces at home and abroad. </p><p>  The Naval Service professional training and education is carried out at the National Maritime College of Ireland in partnership with the Cork Institute of Technology. The National Maritime College of Ireland, and by extension the Naval Service, adheres to the 1995 International Maritime Organisation Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for its seafarers&rsquo; professional qualifications.  Quality assurance for naval training and education is audited by the National Standards Authority of Ireland to meet the I.S. EN ISO 9001 Quality Management System and international best practice. The most recent successful audit of naval training at the National Maritime College of Ireland was carried out in May 2014.  Naval Service professional and military training and education is recognised by the Nautical Institute for Bridge Watchkeepers and by Engineers Ireland for Naval Engineers.  The national human resource management standard for the delivery of training and education in the Naval Service was also successfully audited and re-certified as meeting the Excellence Through People standard in September 2014. In addition the Naval Service conducts detailed and regular operational readiness evaluation for its ships at sea through its Fleet Operations Readiness Standards and Training Section where procedures are assessed, evaluated and compared with international best practice. </p><p>  The Air Corps provides pilot training and air traffic controller training in line with international aviation standards. The Air Corps is recognised by the Irish Aviation Authority and the European Aviation Safety Agency as an Aviation Training Organisation for the delivery of pilot and air traffic control training. Air Corps pilot and air traffic control qualifications are recognized in full by the Irish Aviation Authority. Air Corps apprentice students receive a HETAC level 7 Bachelor of Engineering degree as a Military Aviation Technician from the Dublin Institute of Technology through the Air Corps apprentice school. All further technical training is recognized by the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Irish Aviation Authority and the European Aviation Safety Agency.</p><p>  As can be seen from the above training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces re-skilling and training methods and standards within an international military context.   </p></reply>

I am satisfied that the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps and Naval Service, have the necessary resources to meet these commitments.  With regard to surveillance, the Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Naval Service carries out surveillance across the Irish EEZ and a vessel replacement programme is currently underway with one new vessel, L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett commissioned into service this year, a second vessel, L&Eacute; James Joyce due to be delivered in 2015 and a third vessel to be delivered in 2016. <br/><br/>With reference to Search and Rescue, the Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. In accordance with the current White Paper, the Defence Forces have a role in assisting the civil authorities (Aid to the Civil Authority) and both the Air Corps and the Naval Service provide support to the Coast Guardin accordance with an agreed Service Level Agreement. <br/><br/>A new White Paper on Defence is currently being developed in my Department. This will provide the Defence policy framework for the next decade and beyond.<i></i>I am determined to ensure that the new White Paper fully addresses the Defence response to future security challenges and related resource requirements in a comprehensive way.</p></reply>

As regards remaining ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a holder of a leasehold interest may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in his or her dwelling. To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme.

Under the law as it stands, there is a strong mandate to the courts to consider the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration in making decisions on guardianship, custody and access. </p><p>  In my proposals in the forthcoming Children and Family Relationships Bill I intend to maintain this important focus on the rights of the child, including the rights to maintain personal relationships and direct contact with both parents, where it is in the child's best interests. I also intend to ensure that breaches of court orders in relation to custody, access and maintenance can be dealt with appropriately by giving the courts additional powers to intervene where a parent, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the court's orders.</p><p>  Where a child's mother proposes to take the child from the jurisdiction, her obligations to inform or seek the consent of the child's father depend very much on the circumstances. As a matter of best practice, in a situation where the child's father has ongoing contact with the child, he should be informed of and consulted about any proposed change of residence; where he is the child's guardian or has rights of custody, the child must not be taken from  the jurisdiction without his consent unless the removal is explicitly permitted by the courts. </p></reply>

The first batch of recruits (already in training) will attest as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of 2015 and will be assigned to Garda Stations by the Garda Commissioner.

The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet. As a consequence it is not fully practicable to provide a breakdown of Garda vehicles by each individual Garda station.<br/><br/>In that context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are currently 29 Garda vehicles assigned to the Garda District in which the station referred to is located.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that I recently secured an additional &euro;10 million for investment in the Garda fleet. This funding will provide for a significant number of new Garda vehicles. In that context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that, to date, an order for 370 new vehicles has been placed. These vehicles will be allocated over the coming months, following fit out, in accordance with the Garda Commissioner's identified operational requirements.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The most recent multi-annual overview published by the CSO covers the period 2008-2012 and reported reductions in 10 of the 16 crime categories listed over that period.  The annual figures published by CSO for 2013 report reductions in 11 out of the 14 categories featured in the annual statistics.  Within this broad overall trend, certain categories of offences have fluctuated over time. <br/><br/>The Deputy will also be aware that following on the Report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate on Crime Investigation , the CSO is to carry out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised in the Inspectorate Report to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the official crime statistics which that Office produces.  I await that assessment, which the Deputy will appreciate will take some time to complete.<br/><br/>In this regard I can also advise the Deputy that at the CSO will chair an expert panel to examine the Inspectorate's recommendations on crime statistics.<i></i>The expert panel will review the crime counting and detection rules, as recommended by the Inspectorate, with a view to introducing new national standards. As well as including representatives of the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the panel will have outside experts with relevant expertise<i>.</i><br/><br/>I have also welcomed the fact that the CSO will now examine the means of carrying out a national Crime and Victimisation Survey in the near future, which will provide further insight into the extent and nature of crime in Ireland, independent of reported crime statistics.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.<br/><br/>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the full complement of Garda&iacute;, Reserve Garda&iacute; and civilians attached to each Garda Station in the Cavan-Monaghan Division, on the 30 September 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the table below.<br/><br/>As you will be aware the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore on Monday 15 September 2014.  This marked a positive step forward for policing in Ireland.  Furthermore, as provided for in Budget 2015 the process of recruiting 200 new Garda&iacute; to the force will continue over the next few months.  The situation will be kept under review and when these additional personnel next become available the needs of the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.<br/><br/>It is my intention that there will be ongoing recruitment and I am discussing the details of this with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><table><tr><th>District/Station</th><th><div>Garda</div></th><th><div>Reserve</div></th><th><div>Civilian</div></th></tr><tr><td>Bailieboro</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bailieboro</td><td><div>37</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ballyjamesduff</td><td><div>3</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cootehill</td><td><div>7</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kingscourt</td><td><div>2</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mullagh</td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Shercock</td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Virginia</td><td><div>12</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Carrickmacross</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ballybay</td><td><div>4</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Carrickmacross</td><td><div>44</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Castleblaney</td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Rockcorry</td><td><div>2</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Arva</td><td><div>3</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ballinagh</td><td><div>2</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ballyconnell</td><td><div>18</div></td><td></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Belturbet</td><td><div>6</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Blacklion</td><td><div>3</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>59</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dowra</td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Killeshandra</td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kilnaleck</td><td><div>3</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Swanlinbar</td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clones</td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Emyvale</td><td><div>4</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>78</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Scotstown</td><td><div>2</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p><p>  The National Model of Community Policing is directed and supported each year by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Policing and the 2014 Plan underlines the importance of community based policing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities and business groups, including the hospitality industry, to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.</p><p>  Particular developments in recent years include, the national 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign' which reaffirms the community policing ethos through the hosting of various local activities and as part of which Garda&iacute; give important Crime Prevention and Road Safety Advice.  In addition new Garda Community Crime Prevention Guidelines, which build on the work of existing partnership programmes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, were published in January 2013.  The guidelines give information and advice to help establish new community &quot;watch&quot; groups and also to revitalise existing groups where necessary.</p><p>  Furthermore, a new Garda Text Alert Scheme, which was launched in September 2013, was piloted initially in a number of locations and developed in cooperation with Muintir na T&iacute;re, Neighbourhood Watch, the Irish Farmers Association and related stakeholders.  It provides a further mechanism for Garda&iacute; to provide crime prevention information to community contacts who in turn forward the information to all members of a community groups.  During the first year of the Text Alert system over 600,000 texts have been sent, alerting individuals and communities across Ireland to potential criminal activity in their local area.  There are over 450 Text Alert Groups in towns and villages throughout Ireland with more than 80,000 people signing-up to the scheme.</p><p>  I am pleased to say that my Department continues to provide funding for the Community Alert programme, administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda&iacute;, which supports the operation of over 1,300 local groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also supports the operation of approximately 2,500 Neighbourhood Watch groups countrywide.</p><p>  In August this year, in line with the commitments in the Programme for Government, I published new guidelines for the operation of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) which have an important role in supporting local community policing partnerships.  The guidelines were finalised following a wide ranging consultation process and take account of the general reforms in local government structures.  The new JPC guidelines emphasise the need for collaborative approaches between all stakeholders to address local issues.  They also underline the need for enhanced communication between JPCs, which have a strategic coordinating role, and the full range of local and community based fora which can contribute to the enhancement of community safety and support effective policing responses.</p></reply>

The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, pays the highest regard to the needs of the victims.  The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to the them and their families.<br/><br/>The work of the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers under the Diversion Programme is supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) through the funding and oversight of 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country.

A person found guilty under the Act may be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.

The proposal has been accepted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as one of two projects nationally for more detailed consideration in terms of a possible pilot programme.<br/><br/>In October 2013 the Government gave approval to my Department to progress the proposal. A feasibility study to progress the following actions is underway:<br/><br/>a) Work with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Probation Service and the Courts Service, with critical input from other public bodies, to secure the necessary information for completion of the financial modelling and cost benefit analysis.<br/><br/>b) Examine the means to finance the proposal in years 1-5, and in particular the sourcing of private sector funds for the initiative.<br/><br/>c) Work with other potential stakeholders to determine the scope and cost of interventions and the availability of appropriate non-public service providers to deliver the project.<br/><br/>d) Further examination of the project&rsquo;s specific governance and risks and the most suitable arrangements for addressing these.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that the study will conclude this year after which there will be further engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.</p></reply>

Representatives of all those involved in the delivery of services were invited to consultations during the review process.  This review has now concluded and a roadmap for the future of service delivery has been prepared and approved by Agency&rsquo;s Board.  A structure for the national oversight of Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence Services is currently being put in place by the Agency.<br/><br/>The Agency will liaise with funded Domestic Violence services regarding services required in 2015. Domestic Violence services are being accorded high priority by the Agency in the context of its budgetary allocation and frontline services will be prioritised. <br/><br/>I understand that Safe Ireland had a two year service level agreement with the HSE which expired on 31st December, 2013, but was extended to 31st December, 2014 to allow for establishment of the new Child and Family Agency, to enable the Agency to undertake both a review of services and to develop appropriate governance and oversight arrangements for these services in this area.The Child Agency is in discussions with Safe Ireland regarding the allocation of funding to relevant organisations in 2015.</p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies.  The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.</p><p>  I am aware that a campaign by the staff associations not to pay the fee is actively underway and I am concerned regarding the possible implications for the health service and patient safety should this action continue.  My Department has requested the Board to give this matter very careful consideration at its meeting of the 18th November, with a view to agreeing and implementing a course of action most likely to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  I understand that the staff associations have sought discussions with the Board in this regard.</p></reply>

Government policy in relation to drugs, emphasises the need to provide opportunities for people to move on from illicit drug use to a drug-free life where that is achievable. However, different people in various circumstances may require different approaches to treatment and support.  </p><p>  Methadone maintenance treatment in conjunction with other services and supports, such as counselling, training, rehabilitation and after-care, provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use. A National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, chaired by the HSE, is overseeing the national roll-out of an integrated inter-agency model of care in order to ensure that a person can access the range of services required to support their recovery. </p><p>  In their 2014 annual report, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction state that in Europe an estimated 734,000 opioid users received substitution treatment in 2012 with methadone being the most commonly prescribed substitution medication, received by up to two-thirds of substitution clients, while buprenorphine is prescribed to most of the remaining clients (about 20 %).  Methadone is the principal substitution medication in six countries within the EU, including in Ireland.  </p><p>  The National Drugs Related Deaths Index report, published on the 21st January 2014, shows deaths up to 2011, the latest year for which data is available.  These figures indicate that there was a substantial increase in the number of deaths where methadone was implicated, with 113 such deaths reported in 2011 compared to 60 in 2010. However, the majority of these deaths (86%) involved poly-substance poisonings. In addition, 68% of those deaths where methadone was implicated, were not in opiate substitution treatment at the time of their death. Data including deaths in 2012 will be available early next year.</p><p>  An Opioid Substitution Implementation Group has been established by the HSE to develop a plan for facilitating the wider availability of buprenorphine products as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence. The Group comprises representations from the HSE and the Department of Health including medical professionals with specific interest in addiction. I understand that the HSE is currently in discussions with the supplier company in relation to the pricing structure relating to the product.  The outcome of these discussions will inform the recommendations of the group.</p></reply>

The Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of residential care which are:<br/><br/>-nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,<br/><br/>-bed and board,<br/><br/>-basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, and<br/><br/>-laundry service.<br/><br/>A nursing home may not levy additional charges for the above core services.<br/><br/>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Care Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home and goods or services which are already provided for elsewhere are therefore not also provided for under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. <br/><br/>Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract with each resident which specifies the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The HSE is not party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<br/><br/>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review.  This Review will include consideration of the issue of additional charges for non-core services.Work on the Review is ongoing. It is expected that the Review will be completed in the coming months and the Report will then be made publicly available.</p></reply>

The violence and terror which is being perpetrated by extremists such as ISIS on all Iraqi and Syrian citizens is utterly reprehensible, including as it does the deliberate targeting of men, women and children simply on account of their religious and ethnic background. In my address to the General Assembly of the UN in September, I called for urgent international action to confront threats and violence against ancient Christian minorities throughout the Middle East and an end to the targeting of groups based on ethnicity and religion.</p><p>  On the broader international plane, Ireland has worked at UN and EU level to promote resolutions and actions upholding the principle of freedom of religious belief, notably during our 2013 EU Presidency, and now as a current member of the UN Human Rights Council for the 2013-2015 term. Freedom of religion or belief is a major priority for Ireland as a Council member and we have played a central role in the negotiation of resolutions on this issue. Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.</p></reply>

To that end, on 16 October the Irish and British Government opened political talks, bringing together the Northern Ireland Executive Parties, in order to address a number of key issues that have badly impacted on the reconciliation agenda and on economic renewal, including budgetary and financial matters, legacy issues (parades, flags and identity, dealing with the past), the working of the political institutions in Northern Ireland and outstanding commitments from the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements. Discussions have taken place on each of these streams.<br/><br/>We are now in the fifth week of talks. Since 16 October, I have met on a weekly basis with each of the Northern Ireland Executive Parties, including in some cases, through trilateral meetings held jointly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers.  There has been positive progress in the talks.<br/><br/>Last week all participants in the talks came together to review collectively progress to date and to identify those areas where further work is required in order to make further progress over the coming weeks.  We established a good basis on which to proceed for the next phase of the talks.  Secretary of State Villiers and I are due to report back to Prime Minister Cameron and the Taoiseach respectively on the talks by 28 November.<br/><br/>Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in July, I have made a number of speeches which treat primarily with Northern Ireland and the peace process.

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. During my recent visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts on this important issue, including Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Congressman Joseph Kennedy.</p><p>  Following the bipartisan U.S. Senate bill last year, and despite extensive combined efforts at Government, Embassy and Irish-American community levels since then, the U.S. House of Representatives has not yet taken action that would deliver relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. or an improved facility for future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S. While it appeared before the summer to be the intention of President Obama and his Administration to examine the scope for action on immigration via executive authority, President Obama announced on September 6 that he would delay any such action until after the November U.S. elections.  </p><p>  Since the election President Obama has underlined that he would prefer to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill as soon as possible but reiterated his intention to act under his executive authority to address the issue before the end of the year. For their part, and confirming the political complexity that continues to attach to this matter, Republican Congressional leaders have made clear that at present they would not welcome any such executive action by President Obama on immigration.</p><p>  The exact extent, nature and timing of any action that the U.S. Administration will be ready to take remains to be confirmed and there is clearly no guarantee as to the outcome that can be achieved via executive action.  However, in my official contacts in Washington during my visit at the end of September I stressed the importance of addressing the needs and concerns of the undocumented Irish migrants in any such action.</p><p>  There are limits to what any executive action is likely to be able to do and so further progress on the legislative track is also necessary.  While there appears to be some willingness to consider further action in Congress at some future point, this is dependent on many factors and will not be easy to achieve.</p><p>  I will continue to pursue further opportunities for political engagement on this matter in order to press the case for action and I know that both our Embassy and Consulates in the U.S. will also continue to work resolutely for progress over the coming period from which currently undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. and their families can benefit.</p></reply>

This has recently been discussed at the political talks in Belfast convened by the Irish and British Governments, which began on 16 October.  Among the outstanding commitments are the establishment of a North-South Consultative Forum, a Bill of Rights and an Irish Language Act. The principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Agreement are essential to peace and reconciliation in Ireland and across these islands - as such the position of the Irish Government always has been, and continues to be, that all outstanding elements of the Agreements must be implemented.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of an independent Consultative Forum representative of civil society. The St Andrews Agreement provided further that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North/South Consultative Forum.  In September 2008, the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North-South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The Government awaits a response from the Executive.  The Taoiseach has raised the Forum at each Plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council he has attended, including the most recent meeting on 3 October 2014.</p><p>  I continue to urge all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland. Officials of my Department keep in ongoing contact with representatives of civil society on the issue of a Bill of Rights.</p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular of the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  Delivering an Acht na Gaeilge would reflect the core principle of parity of esteem for the diverse cultural heritage of this island.</p></reply>

My main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will  be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the  education system. We have a growing population of young people in this country  and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we  prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect existing pupil teacher ratios. There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last  school year, than there was the year before. There will be a further increase  of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year. <br/><br/>  At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent  manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of  location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers  are done at local school level. The national average class size at primary  level is 24.7 pupils. However, with over 21,100 classes in over 3,100 primary  schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes  at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management  is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p></reply>

In relation to water, the Deputy may also be aware that schools have been subject to metered water charges imposed by Local Authorities since 1 January 2010. <br/><br/>  The capitation grant is the main funding mechanism for schools to enable them  meet their day to day running costs including the costs of utilities. <br/><br/>  In relation to the charging of fees, the position is that apart from those  recognised fee-charging second level schools, recognised primary and post primary schools are precluded from charging school fees.  Voluntary contributions by parents are permissible provided it is made  absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.  The  manner in which contributions are sought and collected is a matter for each school management; however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</p></reply>

The teacher CPD budget represents 0.76% of my Departments overall  budget for first and second level - almost 6% when salary and pension costs are  excluded. <br/><br/>  The programme of CPD provided addresses a range of priorities such as  facilitating the implementation of new and revised syllabi, new programmes and  other changes in schools designed to increase the relevance of programmes,  promote retention of students, update knowledge, develop school management  expertise, meet special educational and learning support needs and support the  development of educational and vocational guidance.  Some of the main areas of  committed expenditure are the Professional Development Service for Teachers, an  Induction Programme for Newly Qualified Teachers, Health and Wellbeing, Special  Education Support Service, Junior Cycle Reform and Project Maths.  Other areas  of expenditure include the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (Stay Safe), Boards  of Management Training, Teacher Fee Refund Scheme, Teacher Professional  Networks, the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and a number of post  graduate programmes. <br/><br/>  The Teaching Council intends to develop a national framework for CPD and has  begun preparation for this work.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Housing Strategy is to ensure that a sufficient supply of housing is on stream to meet the needs in the relevant authority's area taking account of tenure choice, housing type, affordability, and also, social integration.  The statutory development plan for each planning authority in Dublin includes such a housing strategy, with such strategies being reviewed every six years as part of the Development Plan cycle.  The requirement for authorities to prepare a Housing Strategy on this basis will continue in the new iteration of Part V to be introduced in the forthcoming Planning Bill.</p></reply>

The overall social housing funding provision for 2015 has been increased by excess of &euro;200 million, with capital funding increasing by &euro;180 million, which will allow for significant expansion in social housing provision.  T he specific allocations to be provided in 2015 across all the various funding schemes and programmes will be published in the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume in December. That will include the breakdown of my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme and at that point, my Department will be working with all local authorities , including Meath County Council, to agree individual allocations across all the social housing activities . Specific allocations for subsequent years will be part of the normal budgetary processes for those years.     </p><p>  More broadly, plans in relation to the future delivery of social housing are now being developed as part of a new Social Housing Strategy, which will be considered by Government shortly. The Strategy will contain clear, measurable actions to increase the supply of social housing, based on innovative solutions that will harness new funding streams, in order to continue to protect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society.   </p><p>  Pending the finalisation of social housing funding allocations for 2015 to all local authorities, they are continuing to work on projects announced in March of this year involving a local authority housing construction programme valued at &euro;68 million   nationally and delivering 449 new units of accommodation , and over &euro;46 million allocated to Approved Housing Bodies to provide 416 units of accommodation nationally, for people with special housing needs. Funding to Meath County Council under these measures is a combined &euro; 4.27 million , in respect of some 30 social housing units.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br/><br/>In January 2013, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) was commissioned by my Department to undertake a study into water affordability and the provision of water services in Ireland. Subsequently, an Inter-Departmental Working Group was established in October 2013 to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which might arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. The Group considered the ESRI study as part of their examination of the issues. The report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, which includes the study carried out by the ESRI, has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website and is available at the following link: <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. On 30 September 2014, the CER issued a determination on the plan and full details and associated documentation, including all Irish Water tariffs, are available on the CER website at the following link;<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act in July 2014. This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption w ill have their charges capped. In making its decisions, the Government took account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group  . <br/><br/>Consideration is currently being given to measures to ensure water charges are modest and affordable and to bring the necessary certainty and clarity to the charging arrangements. This consideration includes matters relating to the collection of charges.</p></reply>

International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed, significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.  I understand that a comprehensive water conservation programme will be undertaken by Irish Water and will cover the full spectrum of measures including conservation-related customer aw areness and education campaigns.   </p></reply>

These draft revisions propose: </p><p>  -  The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,</p><p>  -  A mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p><p>  -  The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p><p>  A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 st 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this period. </p><p>  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  However, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines.  Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines. </p><p>  The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  The 2006 Guidelines continue to apply to existing planning applications.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts. </p><p>  I am precluded, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, from exercising any power or control in relation to any individual planning application or appeal with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.  It is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination in relation to a planning application or appeal, and my Department has no function in this regard.  Planning authorities must 'have regard' to planning guidelines issued by my Department.  However, these are issued for guidance purposes to assist planning authorities in the performance of their functions.  Ultimately, planning authorities will make their own decision based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p></reply>

My Department, along with representatives of Irish Water, met with the European Commission in April 2014 to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s written response and explore options for resolving the Commission complaint. The matter was further discussed at a &lsquo;Package Meeting&rsquo; with the European Commission in May 2014. The European Commission&rsquo;s formal response is awaited and at this time the question of fines does not arise.  The following is a list of the agglomerations that are the subject of the Infringement notification: Abbeyfeale, Abbeyleix, Arklow, Athlone, Athy, Ballincollig, Ballybofey/Stranolar, Ballyragget, Blarney, Borrisoleigh, Callan, Carlow, Carrigtohill, Carrickmacross, Carrick-on-Suir, Castlebar, Castlebridge, Castlecomer, Castletroy, Cavan Town, Clifden, Clonakilty, Cobh, Cork City, Dundalk, Dunmanway, Enfield, Enniscorthy, Fermoy, Glanmire/Riverstown/Little Island, Gorey, Kildare Town, Kilkenny City &amp;amp; Environs, Killarney, Killybegs, Kingscourt, Kinsale, Leixlip, Letterkenny, Lusk, Mallow, Manorhamilton, Midleton, Monaghan, Monksland, Mountmellick, Mountrath, Navan, Nenagh, Osberstown, Passage/Monkstown, Piltown, Portarlington, Rathcormac, Rathdowney, Ringaskiddy, Ringsend, Roscommon Town, Roscrea, Shannon Town, Skibbereen, Swords, Templemore, Tralee, Tramore River Valley, Thurles, Tubbercurry, Tullamore, Tullow, Urlingford, Waterford City, Youghal.<br/><br/>Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels including the delivery of water services capital infrastructure. City and county councils (former water services authorities) which were responsible for the provision of water and wastewater services until 1 January 2014 now provide these services to Irish Water on an agency basis including oversight of the operation of wastewater treatment plants.<br/><br/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires Irish Water to put in place an investment plan setting out where it considers investment in infrastructure is necessary for the effective performance of its functions, including compliance with Water Framework Directive requirements , improving sewage treatment and collection infrastructure in accordance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, responding to judgments of the European Court of Justice and achieving environmental and public health objectives arising from various regulations and EPA reports dealing with water quality.Irish Water has published its proposed Capital Investment Plan 2014-2016 and this is available online at the following link: </p></reply>

The group is chaired by my Department at Assistant Secretary level.As well as my own Department, membership is drawn from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, NewERA, the County and City Management Association and the Water Services Transition Office (Local Authorities). <br/><br/>The group oversaw the preparation of the independent assessment and, based on the recommendations of that assessment, the Government decided in December 2011 to establish Irish Water as a public water utility. Following the Government decision in April 2012 that Irish Water should be established as an independent subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute; ireann, membership of the group was extended to include representative s of Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water.<br/><br/>At this point the group &rsquo;s main focus was the development of the implementation strategy to give effect to Government decisions in relation to the water reform programme.

I understand that the pay model is not a new model put in place by Irish Water but was inherited from the parent company Ervia. Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary, as occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case.    The issue of pay progression is not a matter that would have been raised with my Department as it does not arise at present, given that a pay freeze is in place until 2016. Pay progression thereafter is not automatic and will be dependent on, inter alia, affordability. Affordability is a matter for Ervia and Irish Water. </p><p>  My Department sought clarification on the Ervia pay model and I understand that it is a competitive market based model comprising two key elements &ndash; a market based pay range for all employees and a Performance Related Award (PRA) which is at risk. The total of these two elements add up to the external market pay level for any given job. Performance pay will be based on a structured performance review and requires company performance, business unit performance and individual performance metrics to have been met. I am informed that under this proven and modern pay structure Ervia&rsquo;s total pay for any job does not exceed the market total pay for a comparable position. Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award. </p></reply>

To this end, they have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site.  The administration of the Derelict Sites legislation at a local level is a matter for the relevant local authority. I am, however, satisfied that the Derelict Sites legislation is sufficiently robust and that local authorities are in a position to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p><p>  The Government has also recently approved the drafting of a new Planning Bill, which will include provision for a vacant sites levy.
