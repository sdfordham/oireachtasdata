Dublin Bus undertook a substantial campaign to notify their customers.  In addition to use of web/social media and advertising in the press, they distributed 190,000 leaflets and they deployed staff at existing stops informing customers of the changes.  NTA has advised me that to date the changes have been running smoothly.</p>  <p>  There was no reduction in the number of bus services arising from these route changes.  In terms of journey times, average journey times on certain of the diverted routes, including Bus Route 15, have improved following the rerouting.  On other routes using the Westland Row corridor, average journey times did increase slightly due to the slightly longer distance travelled.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future and increased travel demand as the economy recovers further, I recently asked the NTA, as the agency responsible for strategic traffic management in the GDA, to work with the NRA and the GDA local authorities to prepare a report on congestion and to outline actions and investment to address the issue.  I understand that the NTA is close to finalising the report in conjunction with the other agencies.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank city centre retailers and businesses, as well as commuters, for their cooperation and patience during these works.  </p></reply>

The M50 is the most heavily trafficked road in the country with in excess of 130,000 vehicles per day using several sections.  Peak period traffic volumes compromise 44% of the total daily average, with volumes at peak times being an average of 2.3 times higher than off peak volumes.</p>  <p>  A substantial  upgrade of the M50 was completed in 2010. This resulted in the addition of a third lane in both directions from the M1 to Sandyford and a fourth auxiliary lane in places together with the development of freeflow junctions and the introduction of barrier free tolling.  This major investment has significantly enhanced the capacity of the motorway.</p>  <p>  I would also remind the House of the substantial upgrade at Newlands Cross, part of the &euro;282m N7/N11 Arklow to Rathnew PPP scheme, which allows for a continuous, free-flowing route between the M50 and our the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny.</p>  <p>  There are no proposals at present for further investment in additional capacity.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions attached to an Bord Plean&aacute;la's approval of the upgrade was the publication of a scheme of demand management measures.  The NRA in conjunction with the relevant local authorities published its M50 Demand Management Report in April 2014.</p>  <p>Looking to the future and increased travel demand  as the economy recovers further I asked the National Transport Authority, as the agency responsible for strategic traffic management in the GDA, to work with the NRA and the GDA local authorities to prepare a report on congestion and to outline actions and investment that might be required in the short, medium and long term. I understand that the NTA is close to finalising the report in conjunction with the other agencies.  </p></reply>

When I took office, I was well aware that there had previously been an imbalance in funding from the Programme when measured on a per capita basis across counties.  I decided that, in the interest of equity, I should try to redress that imbalance.  Therefore, in 2012,  I decided that counties that had fared less well under previous rounds of the Programme would receive more money per capita than counties who had historically received more than their per capita share.  Again in 2014 I provided more money to counties which hadn&rsquo;t fared as well as others under previous rounds.</p>  <p>  Special priority is also given to projects in designated disadvantaged areas.  These projects are permitted to have lower levels of own funding and gain additional marks in the assessment process.</p>  <p>Because of these changes, I believe that the distribution of funds under the Programme is now more equitable than at any time in the past.  </p></reply>

Decisions on how Co. Donegal is marketed overseas are matters for Tourism Ireland Limited and these decisions are not subject to my approval.  Accordingly, I have referred the Deputy's question to Tourism Ireland for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p><p>I am aware however, that Donegal and the North West continue to feature prominently in the agency's global marketing activity.  According to the agency, in 2014 positive publicity for Donegal worth an estimated &euro;35<font color="#FF0000"> </font>million in equivalent advertising value was generated  in key markets around the world, through media visits, press releases, e-newsletters and media events.  The agency undertakes an extensive programme of familiarisation visits for influential travel and lifestyle journalists from around the world, so that they will encourage prospective holidaymakers to come to Donegal and the North West, through their articles and broadcasts about the destination.  The Wild Atlantic Way also continues as a priority focus for overseas marketing activity this year.</p><p>In terms of the Government's overall tourism objectives, in the coming weeks we will launch the new Tourism Policy Statement, &ldquo;People Place and Policy&rdquo;, which will prioritise investment to maximise the benefits for the tourism sector in all regions in the period to 2025.  It contains ambitious growth targets and  will build on the complementary strengths of our tourism offering, including our uniquely friendly and welcoming people, the beauty and historic heritage of our places and the support and commitment of Government.  It will address issues such as a switch in focus from visitor numbers to visitor revenue, the sustainable development of our tourism infrastructure, the development of increased community engagement with tourism, and ensuring that the tourism sector has the appropriate skills to meet the needs of future visitors.</p></reply>

While the D&uacute;n Laoghaire service has been greatly reduced in recent years the financial impact on the port is significant and challenging and it is clear that the company faces a very different financial and operating environment.</p>  <p>  In announcing the decision to allow for a community led approach toward the development of local  Diaspora Centres, I was clear that the decision not to go ahead with a National Diaspora Centre as a State-backed project does not preclude any other proposal, which is financially robust, from going ahead, and I am aware that D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company has plans in this regard.</p>  <p>  Currently the statutory responsibility for the development of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour vests in the Board of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and I recently met with the full Board to discuss their views on the future. The Board is currently finalising a revised corporate plan which I expect to receive shortly for consideration and comment and which will greatly inform our overall strategic consideration of the issues facing the company and the harbour generally.</p>  <p>  I am clear that, in line with National Ports Policy, the sustainable development of the harbour is best placed within a local authority led governance structure.  As part of this, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council will shortly commence a due diligence process, which, together with the company&rsquo;s own corporate plan, will greatly assist in our strategic consideration of relevant issues.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently finalising the text of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2015.  I expect to seek Government approval of the Bill in the coming months and commence its passage through the Oireachtas.

These include additional Vehicle Inspectors and call centre staff; the provision of new test lanes in 4 test centres; and the extension of opening hours at a number of others.  The majority of test centres have late openings on 3 days a week to 10pm and 20 centres now have extended opening on four days per week.</p>  <p>  A further innovation that was introduced last week is the provision, for four days each week, of a 24-hour NCT service in test centres in Dublin and Cork.  In Dublin, this service is shared between the test centres at Northpoint and Deansgrange.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.70.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000062#WRA07200"><p>I would like to state at the outset that there is no blanket policy of using the Compulsory Purchase Order method for acquiring lands for greenways.  There are a number of models for using land for greenways only one of which is CPO.</p>  <p>  With regard to the various models used to deliver individual projects, it is a matter for the County Council in charge of delivering a specific project to consider access to land on a case by case basis and take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  In the event of a proposed route traversing private land there are a number of options that can be considered by the authority, the first being the permissive access model.  This is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level.  It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners.  Indeed, the most well-known Greenway in the country, the Great Western Greenway from Westport to Achill, has been built using the permissive access model.</p>  <p>  While I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided on.  There is no one size fits all approach to this.</p>  <p>  As stated above, negotiated permissive access from the perspectives of cost and public ownership has value but, for projects of national scale, such as the Dublin to Galway greenway, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land and involve major state investment, it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  </p></reply>

This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of TDs introducing their own Bills from 14 Private Members Bills published by TDs in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.  82 Private Members Bills have been debated in the 31st D&aacute;il to the 6th March 2015 compared to 16 debated in the 30th D&aacute;il.  21 Committee Reports have been debated in the 31st D&aacute;il to 6th March 2015 compared to 9 debated in the 30th D&aacute;il.</p><p>- The pre-Legislative review system which is a requirement for all non-emergency legislation.</p><p>- Restructuring of the Oireachtas Committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16.</p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has also been expanded.</p><p>In addition, as a result of a set of reforms introduced to reduce the use of the guillotine, just 3 Bills were guillotined in the D&aacute;il in 2014 down from 12 in 2013 and from 19 in 2010.  This has been achieved by such reforms as reducing the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year, increasing the time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il (by increasing the number of total sitting days, and extending each sitting day.</p><p>The Government has also improved the way legislation in the Chamber is debated:</p><p>- At First Stage the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now has 5 minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain their reasons for drafting the legislation.</p><p>- At Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage shall have a speaking slot, of the same length as the Minister or Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on its findings.</p><p>- At the end of the second stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies chosen by the Ceann Comhairle who had previously spoken.</p><p>Taken together, these reforms show a real commitment by Government to continue to meet its commitments in this area as outlined in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

There are approximately 70,200 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.</p>  <p>  The Department has measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme.  Notices circulated to Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014.  A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate interventions continue to be provided in a consistent manner where rent supplement recipients have been threatened with homelessness due to rising rents.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to monitor the measures in place to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided to rent supplement recipients with the Interim Tenancy Sustainment protocol operating in Dublin now being extended to include single persons and couples; the protocol was also extended to Cork city in January 2015.  The protocol has assisted approximately 390 families to date.  The Department&rsquo;s response to the current difficulties in the private rented market remains under close review.</p>  <p>  Following engagement with the Department the main property websites have removed the advertising option which filtered rent supplement recipients from their websites. The Department is also engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the issue of some potential landlords refusing rent supplement tenancies and welcomes the recent announcement that they propose to address the issue with an amendment contained in the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015.</p>  <p>  It remains open to any person who has been refused a private tenancy and who feels discriminated against on the basis of the nine grounds set out in the equality legislation to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts.</p>  <p>  If an existing  tenant in receipt of rent supplement has an issue with rent levels they should contact their local Community Welfare Service representative for assistance.</p></reply>

The research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate of &euro;186 per week.  The scheme was discontinued on the basis of this evidence and I have no plans to reverse this decision.</p>  <p>  Payment of the supplement will continue to be made to the existing 4,800 recipients for as long as they continue to be entitled to the payment.  In cases of particular hardship that may present, officials have the legislative power to award a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in cases of exceptional need.</p></reply>

However this figure is based on a calculation of the total number of children of Direct Provision Allowance (DPA) claimants, without any knowledge of whether they would meet the qualifying criteria as set out above.

The placements are in organisations operating in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  Internship opportunities can vary significantly spanning many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  </p>  <p>  The principal aim of the scheme is to provide interns with an opportunity to keep close to the labour market while gaining valuable experience in a working environment.  Records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals have progressed into employment across various occupations/ disciplines on completion of their internship placements.</p>  <p>  A variety of measures have been introduced to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme.  In order for an application from a Host Organisation to be approved the host organisation must meet a number of criteria.  These criteria are to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.</p>  <p>  Participation in the scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge team at any stage of their Internship for advice and support.  Additionally, any individual, who has concerns regarding an internship or where they feel that an organisation may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, they should contact the JobBridge team by calling 046 9738080 or Freephone 1890 8000 24.</p>  <p>  Case Officers in Donegal are not aware of any issues with the administration of Job Bridge  in the organisations mentioned in the PQ.

Unfortunately, the Department does not operate any scheme which would be able to provide funding of this nature.</p>  <p>  The Department supports community initiatives through community work placement programmes such as community employment, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  These programmes are delivery locally through sponsor organisations or local development companies.  The Deputy should note that the additional resources provided through these programmes are mainly geared towards the provision of materials and to cover input and operating costs associated with work placements and training.</p></reply>

To qualify for the payment, a customer must be a farmer, farming land in the State, aged between 18 and 66 and satisfy a means test.</p>  <p>  The means test for Farm Assist takes account of virtually every form of income but assesses it in different ways and disregards various amounts.  Different rules apply to income from farming and other forms of self-employment, income from certain schemes such as the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS) and Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), income from employment and income from property and capital.</p>  <p>  The application form for the Farm Assist scheme asks the customer to supply farm receipts and invoices in date order to confirm income, sales, purchases and expenses covering the last 12 months.</p>  <p>  This form does not have space to outline their farm outgoings as it would typically not be feasible for customers to list the entire farm operating costs for the previous 12 month period on an application form. However, a customer can supply details of outgoings with the completed application form if they so wish.</p>  <p>  An examination of farm outgoings is included in the assessment process and the Social Welfare Inspector takes a detailed account of all operating costs when interviewing the customer.  This usually gives the customer a good opportunity to explain both the income generated and the operating costs associated with the farm directly with an Inspector.</p></reply>

Information providers support their clients to act on their own behalf wherever possible (self-advocacy). They also advocate directly on behalf of their clients through contacting and negotiating with third parties or attending meetings, hearings or appeals.</p><p>In 2014, the nationwide network of CISs was allocated funding of some &euro;12.5 million from CIB&rsquo;s overall budget allocation of &euro;46 million.  During 2014, CISs provided an advocacy service to over<b></b>2,500 people.  Overall, 56% of advocacy issues related to social welfare, 22% related to employment issues, 8% to housing issues with the balance relating to health, consumer affairs and moving country.  In addition, during the same period, the CIS&rsquo;s assisted over 7,000 clients with once-off advocacy<b></b>requirements.</p><p>In 2011, the National Advocacy Service (NAS) was established under the Citizens Information Board to provide an independent, confidential, and free representative advocacy service to vulnerable people with disabilities who cannot self-advocate, while supporting others to use mainstream services.  The National Advocacy Service has its national office in Dublin, and provides services through its four regions.  Funding of &euro;3.07 million was made available to NAS in 2014 from the CIB.</p><p>During 2014, NAS provided an advocacy service to some 1,012 people.  This number includes over 340 new cases.  Overall, 28% of advocacy cases related to housing issues, 19% related to health issues, 13% related to social welfare and 11% to justice issues, while a further 7% related to court cases regarding children.  The remainder involved birth, family and relationship, finance, taxation, education, employment, travel and recreation and bereavement related cases.</p></reply>

There has been a recovery in economic growth and employment, with the unemployment rate falling from 13.1% in 2013 and to 11.3% in 2014.  This indicates that employment opportunities are becoming available.

In the current labour market environment JobBridge provides individuals with a unique opportunity to secure work experience in a new field.</p><p>The scheme has made very significant progress since it came into operation in July 2011.  To date some 37,700 internship placements have commenced with over 6,100 participants currently undertaking internships and over 1,000 internship posts available on the JobsIreland website.</p><p>A variety of measures have been introduced to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme.  In order for an application from a host organisation to be approved it must meet a number of criteria and the host organisation must accept the terms and conditions of the scheme before their application can be processed.</p><p>The full list of the criteria for host organisations is listed on the Jobbridge Section of the Department&rsquo;s website , which includes the following:</p><p>- In order to qualify for an internship an organisation must have a minimum of 1 full time employee who is employed for 30 hours or more per week;</p><p>- The host organisation must be a legal entity and/or a charity recognised by the Revenue Commissioners;</p><p>- The host organisation may not provide an internship opportunity under the Scheme to an individual they have an existing or had a previous employment relationship with;</p><p>- The host organisation may not have vacancies in the area of activity in which the internship is offered; and</p><p>- The internship cannot displace an employee. The scheme administrator reserves the right to review cases where it is reported that this is the case.</p><p>These criteria are to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the intern.  Additionally in order for an internship to commence a Standard Agreement must be signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation.  This Agreement clearly sets out the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship. The Department has a robust monitoring system in place to ensure compliance with the scheme criteria.</p><p>It is also worth noting that participation in the scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge Team at any stage of their internship for advice and support.  Consequently, any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, including cases of suspected displacement and quality, may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are taken seriously by the Department and are fully investigated.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.187.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000065#WRD01100"><p>In the scenario provided by the Deputy, an individual working 19.5 hours on minimum wage, would earn approximately &euro;169 a week. Together with the salary, and the figures provided for one-parent family payment (OFP) and family income supplement (FIS), and fuel allowance, this amounts to a cumulative total of &euro;459 per week.  It should be noted that Fuel Allowance is payable on OFP and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) but not FIS.  Fuel Allowance averages out to &euro;10 per week.</p>  <p>  On foot of the July 2015 changes, OFP recipients already in receipt of FIS will see their FIS payment re-rated to take account for the loss of their OFP.   All customers who transition from OFP to a FIS payment, will be able to apply for the back to work family dividend (BTWFD).  The BTWFD allows these customers to retain the child proportion of their payment, which equals &euro;29.80 per week per child (up to a maximum of &euro;119.20 for four children), for two years, with full entitlement for the first year and 50% entitlement for the second year.</p>  <p>  An individual in the situation outlined above will continue to have a salary of &euro;169 a week.  Their family income supplement will be re-rated to &euro;202 a week and they will also be eligible to apply for the BTWFD which amounts to &euro;29.80 per child a week.  On this basis, their revised income will be &euro;400.80.</p>  <p>  I think it is important to highlight that there has been a recovery in economic growth and employment, with the unemployment rate falling from 13.1% in 2013 to 11.3% in 2014.  This indicates that there are additional employment opportunities available and that, as the economy improves, wages may increase impacting positively on an individual in this situation.  </p>  <p>  Before I introduced the reforms, the One Parent Family Payment was a passive scheme with limited engagement by the State with recipients. For many lone parents, most of whom are women, this has meant long-term social welfare dependency, associated poverty and social exclusion for them and their families.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely. These reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to access the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment programmes, to develop their skills set and, ultimately, to secure employment and financial independence.</p></reply>

Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services.  In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase.  </p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.  </p></reply>

This involves, among other things, the checking and inspection of bulk fuel transportation vehicles, including, from time to time, the taking of fuel samples from such vehicles.</p><p>The checking of vehicles and the taking of fuel samples may be carried out only  by officers who have been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to do so, and only officers who have received appropriate training may take samples.  This training is provided by a qualified mechanic who is a Revenue employee, in conjunction with Revenue's Training Branch, and covers the correct procedures for obtaining samples, the safe use of specialised equipment for doing so and health and safety matters, including the appropriate isolation from members of the public of the vehicle from which a sample is being taken.</p><p>I am informed also that the sampling of bulk transportation vehicles is undertaken in accordance with strict health and safety protocols, and may be carried out only by officers trained specifically for that task.  To date, 35 officers, based at locations around the country, have received this training.</p><p>The specific safety regime applied in respect of a vehicle from which samples are being taken depends on the type of fuel being carried by the bulk fuel transportation vehicle. Vehicles carrying diesel type fuels (that is, road diesel, marked gas oil or kerosene) may occasionally, depending on the nature of the location concerned, be sampled at roadside checkpoints.  Bulk fuel transportation vehicles carrying petrol or suspected of doing so are always removed to a safe and secure location for the carrying out of the sampling. A health and safety risk assessment is carried out by the senior officer present before a decision is made to proceed with sampling.</p><p>The numbers of samples of petrol and diesel that have been taken from bulk fuel transportation vehicles from 2011 to date are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total No. Samples</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (to 6 March)</td><td>9</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These include establishing operational capability with funders and lending partners, building internal systems and business processes and establishing a team to safely and effectively manage the funding provided on behalf of the State. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the SBCI launched its first product programme on the 19th February 2015 and lending commenced on the 9th   March 2015 through both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank Plc.  An initial sum of &euro;400m has been allocated between Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks Plc. for lending to SMEs.  The Government's aim for the SBCI is to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland.  The SBCI will achieve this by working with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market through allocating the remaining &euro;400m to a number of new and non-traditional SME finance providers.  It is also an objective of the SBCI to encourage competition within the SME funding market through the provision of funding to a broad range of potential lending partners.  </p>  <p>  The allocation  of funding across a broader range of lending partners diversifies risk for the SBCI and is prudent in the context of managing funds provided by the state and other funding partners including EIB and KfW.   </p>  <p>  At present, the SBCI is actively engaged with other potential lending partners in regards to their operational capability with the ambition to become SBCI lending partners during 2015 thereby providing Irish SMEs with greater choice in securing the most appropriate funding for their business needs.</p></reply>

Provisions for the VAT exemption applicable to medical services are contained in Paragraphs 2(3) and 2 (7) of Schedule 1 to the Value - Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  Details of the relevant provisions are as follows:</p><p>- Professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health and Children (other than dental or optical services), but only if those services are not supplied in the course of carrying on a business that wholly or partly consists of selling goods.</p><p>- Other professional medical care services that, on 1 January 2010, were recognised by the Revenue Commissioners as exempt activities. </p><p>These provisions transpose Article 132 (1) (c) of the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC on which Irish VAT law is based and with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Professional medical care services recognised by the Department of Health and Children, and which qualify for VAT exemption, are generally those medical care services supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries.  These include persons registered under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, persons registered under the Nurses Act 1985 and dieticians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers and speech and language therapists designated under Section 4(1) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The exemption also applies to chiropodists, chiropractors and osteopaths since these medical care services were recognised by the Revenue Commissioners as exempt activities on 1 January 2010.</p><p>Other services, including craniosacral therapy, cannot benefit from the medical services exemption except in the very unusual circumstances where a doctor makes a composite supply for a single consideration of exempt medical services and craniosacral therapy and the exempt services are regarded as the principal supply. In these circumstances the entire supply is treated as exempt.  I would refer the Deputy to the Revenue publication Medical Service on the Revenue website that provides additional information in relation to the VAT treatment of Medical Services ().</p></reply>

I am retaining the child ceiling of &euro;500 for those aged 18 to 20 that are continuing to avail of insurance at the child premium rates.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have agreed to operate the changes on an administrative basis pending the provision of the underpinning legislation as part of the next Finance Bill. Therefore, the changes will be effective for all policies purchased or renewed (or which come into effect) on or after 1 May 2015.</p>  <p>  The current regime for tax relief on medical insurance premiums provides a maximum tax relief ceiling of &euro;500 in respect of a child, which is defined as an individual under the age of 18 years or, if over 18 years of age and under 23 years of age, who is receiving full-time education and in respect of whom a child premium is paid.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is not compulsory for insurers to offer child premium rates to young adults under the current system and it will not be compulsory for them to offer reduced premiums under the new system.  Therefore, where a full adult premium is payable, the full adult ceiling for tax relief of &euro;1,000 has always been available and this will continue to be the case.  It should be further noted that the maximum tax relief is available at the rate of 20% of the premium payable or &euro;200, whichever is lower.  Thus, where a reduced premium is being availed of, the full adult ceiling for relief may not be employed depending on the premium price.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners tentatively estimate that the cost of extending the full &euro;1,000 adult ceiling for private medical insurance tax relief to all persons aged 21 or over, would be approximately &euro;1 million. </p>  <p>  This provisional estimate is based on returns to Revenue for the year 2013 (the most recent year for which data is available) and does not take account of any changes in the level of medical insurance coverage or premium rates in the interim.</p></reply>

The Register was populated using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases and various other Government and non-Government sources.  These various data sets were cross-checked by Revenue to ensure the accuracy of the information in respect of each property being included on the Register.</p>  <p>  However, given the scale of the project it was inevitable that there would be some errors and in a relatively small number of instances, properties were either duplicated or omitted from the Register.  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue communicated extensively in regard to this possibility and the onus was clearly placed on property owners to confirm the correct details where the information on the Register was inaccurate. </p>  <p>  On foot of the correspondence received from the person on 27 February, direct contact was made with him by the LPT team and the Register was corrected in respect of the property.  During the course of the direct contact it emerged that the person had also not filed an LPT Return or made any payment in respect of his current principal private residence.  The LPT team member assisted the person in completing an LPT Return for his property and also advised him on the various options available to him in respect of the outstanding liability taking account of his individual circumstances.</p></reply>

This is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse.  Any delay in the collection of tax that is properly due adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses.  </p>  <p>  Revenue assures me that its strong preference is to work with viable businesses or taxpayers suffering temporary cashflow difficulties to agree a mutually acceptable solution rather than deploying debt collection/enforcement options.  Revenues commitment in this regard is clearly evidenced by the fact that it granted almost 9,000 phased payment arrangements in respect of over &euro;120m of debt during 2014 rather than using debt collection/enforcement action to secure the liabilities.  </p>  <p>  Where debt collection/enforcement action becomes necessary to secure an outstanding debt, the Revenue caseworker firstly writes to the defaulting business or taxpayer demanding that the liability be paid within a specified timeframe, which is normally seven days.  The  final demand letter also clearly warns that the consequence of continued non-compliance is referral of the debt to enforcement.  Revenues first line debt collection/enforcement options for the majority of cases are Sheriff and Solicitor action and when a case is referred, responsibility for any future negotiation is delegated to the collection agent.  </p>  <p>  Once a case is referred for debt collection/enforcement, the Sheriff or Solicitor writes to the taxpayer or business offering a final opportunity to agree a mutually acceptable solution.  Where no solution can be agreed, the Sheriff or Solicitor then seeks to collect the outstanding amounts, including costs, in accordance with the various legal powers available to them. </p>  <p>  Solicitor (Court) action is used to secure judgment against a defaulting business or taxpayer.  The judgment, which confirms the debt before the Courts, can be made public and can also be used by Revenue to place judgment mortgages against any property (owned by the business or taxpayer) to the value of the outstanding debt.  Judgments are also used as part of the proceedings associated with Bankruptcy, Forced Sale of property and committal to prison, though Revenue only applies such sanctions in the most egregious or intransigent cases. In all cases where judgment is sought, the business or taxpayer is notified by way of Court summons.  </p>  <p>  Finally in regard to notification of judgment mortgages, Revenue has confirmed to me that it is the responsibility of the Property Registration Authority to inform the business or taxpayer that such a charge has been put in place.</p></reply>

I understand that the Deputy is particularly interested in the latter issue.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 reduced the annual imputed ARF distribution rate from 5% to 4% for ARF owners in the age group 60 to 70 years whose ARFs have assets of &euro;2 million or under.  This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs (or vested PRSAs).</p>  <p>  As regards the changes to AMRF access, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements (the so-called  ARF option), where an individual in a Defined Contribution pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum set aside amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with the &euro;63,500.</p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owners discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements).</p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension nest-egg to provide for the latter years of his/her retirement.  Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation.  While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.</p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF.  This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.</p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years.  In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.</p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75.  This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.</p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a draw down of a lesser value than will now be permitted.  I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it.</p></reply>

The EFSF Framework Agreement sets out the governance arrangements for the EFSF.  This provides for a Board of Governors made up of the Finance Ministers of EFSF Member States, and a Board of Directors made up of senior Finance Ministry officials of the EFSF Member States.</p>  <p>  Article 10(5)(d) of the consolidated EFSF Framework Agreement provides that the Board of Directors, by  unanimous decision, may agree any modification to the availability period of any outstanding Financial Assistance (as well as modifications to the aggregate principal amount, repayment profile or interest rate).</p>  <p>  On 20 February 2015, the Eurogroup noted a request from the Greek authorities for an extension of the second programme in order to allow the successful completion of the fifth review.  The Greek authorities agreed to present a first list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, by 23 February, which they have done.   </p>  <p>  The Institutions (the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF) have provided their first view on the list of reform measures and stated that the list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review.  The measures will need to be further specified and then agreed with the Institutions by the end of April.  On this basis, the Eurogroup on 24 February 2015 agreed in principle to proceed with the national approval procedures in order to extend the current programme by up to four months.</p>  <p>  The resultant Third Amendment to the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement with Greece (MFFA) gives effect to the Eurogroup statement of 20 February 2015 by addressing two main aspects of the decision:</p>  <p>  - Extending the Availability Period of the Loan Facility under the MFFA for a further 4 months to the end of June 2015. </p>  <p>  - The return of the EFSF funds held by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), and making those funds available for the duration of the MFFA extension for bank recapitalisation and resolution costs. </p>  <p>  The Amendment Agreement also includes some other administrative changes to the MFFA, as well as consequential changes required to implement the two aspects above.  This amendment is being agreed on the basis of proposals presented by Greece, and the agreement in principle to the extension, indicated by me at Eurogroup, was in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Agreement as approved by the Oireachtas in the legislation already referenced.

In the National Accounts, monthly trade exports are adjusted for contract manufacturing and for other methodological and data purposes.  However, these contract manufacturing activities also result in greater imports of services, in particular royalty imports (related to the use of intellectual property associated with the finished products) and the manufacturing services supplied by the contract manufacturer.  In arriving at estimates of GDP it is necessary to subtract these service imports and other costs from the value of exports.  The result shows that the overall impact on Ireland's GDP of these activities is not a significant factor in explaining the recent improvement in economic performance in this country.</p></reply>

Based on the details supplied by you, it would appear that the couple concerned have benefitted by approximately &euro;13 per week from the Budget tax measures. The Deputy will be aware that a cap of &euro;14 per week was implemented as part of the Budget package to ensure that those with incomes in excess of &euro;70,000 did not benefit more than those with incomes at that level.  However, when increases in the level of Child Benefit introduced in the Budget are taken into account, the couple concerned are benefitting by around &euro;15 per week. </p>  <p>  The Government targeted its Budget package at the "squeezed middle", i.e. those earning between &euro;32,000 and &euro;70,000 per annum.  While I am sympathetic to all those facing financial difficulties, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that over 87% of tax cases will have income of &euro;70,000 or less in 2015.  Therefore, it would be difficult to categorise households which have income in excess of &euro;70,000 as being in a "middle income" bracket. </p>  <p>  All married one-earner couples with sufficient income are benefitting from the increase in the standard rate band by &euro;1,000 from &euro;41,800 to &euro;42,800 in Budget 2015.  These couples also benefit from the cuts to the higher rate of income tax in the Budget, and from a reduction in USC if their income is under &euro;87,500.  The reason married one earners don't benefit as much from the income tax cuts, as a single individual or a married two-earner couple, is because they already pay much less income tax because of the transferable standard rate band.  For example, a married one earner on &euro;55,000 who has children will pay 55% less income tax than a single individual on the same income, in 2015. </p>  <p>  The system of individualisation, which has been in the tax code since 1999, is now integral to the tax system.  When first announced, the stated purpose of individualisation was essentially, to ease the burden on single persons (65% of the work force), to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  At the same time, a home carer allowance was introduced to compensate those who chose to stay at home to care for children rather than participate in the labour market.</p>  <p>  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system, with the standard rate band partially transferable between spouses, &euro;9,000 being the gap between the single and married one-earner bands.</p>  <p>  To complete or to reverse individualisation would cost in the region of &euro;800 million.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that no change be made to the current system. It concluded that the current system represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that that reversal of individualisation would see a second spouse entering the workforce, being liable to the marginal rate of tax on the first euro of income. This would act as a significant disincentive for those affected spouses who wish to return to work.</p></reply>

Customers in arrears will be reviewed for eligibility based on affordability, their willingness to prioritise their mortgage payments and engage with the bank.  The bank offers a Mortgage to Rent solution to the customer if they are deemed eligible. </p>  <p>  From a general policy perspective, the approach of the Government is to support people in genuine mortgage arrears and where feasible to put in place a sustainable restructure to address and resolve such a difficultly.  This is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears where it requires a lender in respect of a cooperating borrower to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender and that a lender must document its consideration of each option examined and the reasons why the options offered/not offered to the borrower are/are not appropriate and sustainable.</p>  <p>  If a solution cannot be agreed between borrower and lender, or if it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, there are alternative mechanisms available to allow a debtor remain in the house in appropriate cases.  For example, the Mortgage to Rent scheme is available in cases where the house and household would be appropriate and eligible for social housing.  Where the borrower and lender cannot agree on a sustainable mortgage restructure, the debtor has the option to formulate and propose a PIA to his/her secured and other creditor(s).  This initiative rests solely with the debtor and, in formulating a PIA, a personal insolvency practitioner is under an onus, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to formulate the proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy a principal private residence.</p></reply>

The Commissioners currently lease two adjoining buildings in Ballybay which are not considered appropriate for the Department's existing business processes or future operational requirements.</p>  <p>  The Commissioners have investigated other options in Ballybay and have inspected a number of properties, including those referred to by the Deputy, with a view to potentially adapting a building to meet the Department of Social Protection's requirements.  Significant investment would be required to bring the proposed properties up to modern standards which would not be financially sustainable based on prevailing rental levels.</p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Social Protection has decided to move the current facilities to premises in Monaghan town that will fully meet the Department's accommodation brief.

A total sum of &euro;662,000 was allocated to DCC under the Government Decision. The local authorities submitted to the Office of Public Works (OPW) programmes of repair works setting out how they intended to spend their allocations. DCC's programme of works did include for works at Maghery Strand. Funding for works at this location was not approved however, as, on the basis of the information provided, the proposed works did not meet the criteria of reinstatement of existing built coastal defence infrastructure. It is for DCC to resubmit application which meets criteria. The programme of works did not include works at Buncronan, Mountcharles and as a result there is no specific provision for works at Buncronan in the total sum of &euro;662,000 allocated to DCC under the Government Decision.  As it was not included in DCC's programme any proposals for works in that location must be considered outside of the Government Decision.</p><p>The OPW operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This administrative Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial are published on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie</i>. It is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets. A Local Authority may apply to the OPW for support under the scheme having regard to those eligibility criteria.  Application forms are available on OPW's website under Flood Risk Management and decisions are made having regard to the overall availability of funding for flood risk management.</p></reply>

The alternative approach of providing more limited access to sick pay over a shorter time frame, is often more restrictive. </p>  <p>  The application of a four-year look back was agreed by the Labour Court and reflects the practice that previously existed in the majority of the Public Service.  A key rationale for maintaining this provision was that otherwise the introduction of the new Scheme would result in an employee's four-year sick leave record being cleared.  Allowing public servants who had exhausted their access to paid sick leave under previous sick leave arrangements to have access to the full allowance of paid sick leave under the new Scheme would have undermined a fundamental purpose of the new Sick Leave Scheme, which was to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave, and on that basis was rejected by the Labour Court.</p></reply>

The reduced rates of pay for new entrants to the public service in general, and to the Education Sector specifically, were one of a number of measures introduced over the period since the fiscal crisis began which directly affected the pay of staff.  The reductions in starting pay were introduced as part of the National Recovery Plan in order to reduce the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill. Negotiations in the Haddington Road Agreement subsequently provided for an agreed process for the amalgamation of pay scales to address the imbalance between those who entered the public service as new entrants after January 2011 and those who became public servants before January 2011.  This measure represents a significant redressing of the imbalance particularly in the context of the savings required under the Haddington Road Agreement.</p></reply>

For internationally trading enterprises that are price takers productivity and wage relativities with those in competing countries will impact the pay levels that can be sustained.  Where productivity gains support higher pay there is evidence that a virtuous circle may result whereby employees are motivated to work harder, more capable and productive workers are attracted, fewer leave thereby reducing the costs of hiring and training new workers, quality and customer service may be enhanced, disciplinary problems and absenteeism may reduce as higher pay is associated with better health.</p>  <p>  As the National Competitiveness Council have pointed out, the skills of the workforce are a primary driver of productivity and long-term competitiveness as is investment in innovation.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial relations issues lies ultimately with employers and workers and their respective representatives as appropriate.  However, the industrial relations bodies of the State remain available to assist parties if requested.</p><p>Ireland has a robust body of employment law, which provides comprehensive protections for employees.  Irish law in the area of &ldquo;transfer of undertakings&rdquo; (commonly referred to as TUPE) is the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003,<i></i>S.I. No. 131 of 2003.  The Regulations implement the mandatory provisions of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 which is aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer (including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger.  In addition, section 21 of the <i>Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006</i>transposed a further provision of the EU Transfer of Undertakings Directive relating to the information to be provided by the original employer to the new employer.</p><p>The 2003 Regulations provide that all the rights and obligations of an employer arising from a contract of employment (including terms inserted by collective agreements) other than pension rights, existing on the date of a transfer, are transferred to the new employer on the transfer of the business or part thereof.</p><p>In accordance with the Transfer of Undertaking Regulations, it would be a matter for a Rights Commissioner to determine in law if any particular case does, in fact, constitute a transfer of undertakings situation.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service provides information on employees&rsquo; rights and how to obtain redress if an employee considers that their employment rights may have been infringed.  It can be contacted at Lo-call:1890 80 80 90 or via its website .  The Single Complaint Form for submitting complaints regarding breaches of employment rights is also available at .</p></reply>

The Act provides that a commercial practice, such as advertising or marketing, is misleading if it includes the provision of false information in relation to a wide range of matters relating to the trader and his or her goods or services, and if that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.  A trader who engages in such a misleading commercial practice commits an offence.  A commercial practice may also be misleading if the trader omits or conceals information necessary for an informed consumer decision and if that omission or concealment would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.</p>  <p>  An advertiser who publishes an advertisement which contravenes the Act does not commit an offence, however, if the advertiser proves that he or she did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that its publication would be in contravention of the Act.  In order to assist enforcement of the Act&rsquo;s provisions on misleading advertising, an advertiser who accepts or agrees to publish an advertisement is required to make a record of the name and address of a trader who places an advertisement, and to keep that record for not less than two years from the date of its publication.</p>  <p>  Advertisements in print and other media that are directed at businesses are regulated by the European Communities (Misleading and Comparative Marketing Communications) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 774 of 2007) which give effect to Directive 2006/114/EC on Misleading and Comparative advertising.  The Regulations provide that a marketing communication is misleading if, in any way (including its presentation), it deceives or is likely to deceive in relation to any matter specified in the Regulations the trader to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches, and by reason of its deceptive nature, it is likely to affect the trader's economic behaviour or to injure or be likely to injure a competitor.</p>  <p>  In addition to these legislative provisions, advertisements in print and other media come within the system of self-regulation established and administered by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.  The Authority&rsquo;s Code of Standards for Advertising, Promotional and Direct Marketing requires advertising and other marketing communications to be 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'.  Members of the Authority are required to abide by the Code and not to publish an advertisement that contravenes it.</p></reply>

Until the EU Commission formally issues any such proposal, and the details are known, it would be premature for me to comment at this early stage.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the <i>Programme for Government</i>contains a commitment to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector and this will be met by way of enabling powers to regulate certain practices in the grocery good sector.  These powers are contained in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014. On 22 December 2014, I issued a set of draft regulations for public consultation with a deadline for submissions of the end of February 2015.  My Department is currently examining these submissions before the final version of the regulations is promulgated and the regulations are signed into law (as soon as practicable) during 2015.</p><p>The new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will have responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of these regulations.</p><p>These national Irish regulations will go much further than the EU voluntary supply chain initiative which has been in operation since September 2014.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, I have consistently emphasised that it is important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that the introduction of any regulations does not, and cannot, guarantee anything in relation to the prices received by any given link in the supply chain.  Negotiations on price will remain an issue between the contracting parties as happens in any commercial relationship.  What the new regulations will be intended to achieve is to regulate certain practices, not set prices.</p></reply>

In January 2014, Orders were signed to effect recommendations of the Labour Court Review of the Joint Labour Committee System (JLC), including that relating to the continuation of a JLC in the Security Sector.  Subsequently the Labour Court appointed members to that JLC.  Before the members were appointed, the Labour Court consulted with IBEC, ICTU and the two employer bodies most associated with the security sector &ndash; the National Union of Security Employers (NUSE) and the Irish Security Industry Association (ISIA) who all nominated representatives for membership of the JLC.  Having considered the names put forward by those organisations the current members of the JLC were appointed on 12 May 2014.<table><tr><th>Employer Representatives</th><th>Nominated by</th></tr><tr><td>Bill Brown</td><td>NUSE</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Doyle</td><td>NUSE</td></tr><tr><td>Noel Fitzpatrick</td><td>NUSE</td></tr><tr><td>Alan Durnan  </td><td>ISIA</td></tr><tr><td>John O&rsquo;Donoghue</td><td>ISIA</td></tr><tr><td>Jim Dolan</td><td>ISIA</td></tr><tr><td>Employee Representatives</td><td>Nominated by</td></tr><tr><td>Gary Smith</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Ed Kenny</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Peadar Nolan</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Ian Black</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Tony Prior</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Christy Waters  </td><td>ICTU</td></tr></table></p><p>The Chairperson and Independent Member (and Chairperson in the absence of the Chair) are Anna Perry and Michael Keegan respectively, who are Industrial Relations Officers with the Labour Relations Commission. </p><p>The Court, both from its own knowledge and from a review of the Annual Report of the Private Security Authority, decided on the composition of the Committee. </p><p>I understand that the employer bodies represented on the Committee employ approximately 11,500 of the 14,700 employees that work in the sector and the employee representatives on the Committee represent approximately 5,500 of those employed in the sector.  In this regard, it should be borne in mind that one of the purposes in general of the Employment Regulation Orders is to give protection to employees who are not otherwise represented.</p><p>In formulating possible proposals that might form the basis of an Order, the Security JLC is obliged to consider the criteria as set out in Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 Act as amended, in formulating the proposals, and the Committees&rsquo; consideration of these criteria is encapsulated in the Report of the Chairman which will accompany the proposals, if any, when they are submitted to the Labour Court.</p><p>Notice of the making of the proposals was published in the Legal Notices sections of three national daily newspapers, the Irish Times, Irish Independent and Examiner.  They were also published on the Workplace Relations website.  Submissions on the proposals were sought from interested parties. </p><p>If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration.  If the Court decides they should be adopted it will forward a copy of the proposals to the Minister, who, if it is considered appropriate to do so, will make an Order giving effect to them. </p><p>Representations have been received from a number of employers in the Security sector expressing concern at the proposals under consideration at the moment for an ERO governing terms and conditions of workers in that sector.  Those employers have had an opportunity to raise their concerns directly with the JLC during the consultation process.</p><p>JLCs and the Labour Court are independent of the Minister in the carrying out of their respective functions.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in a process that is governed by statute.</p></reply>

These site visits may take place at the beginning or end of the process and in some cases there are no site visits involved.  Site visits, when they do occur, involve new companies visiting a location for the first time and senior executives of existing companies.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, the IDA Ireland does not comment publicly on the success rate of such site visits.</p>  <p>  While these site visits contribute to investment approvals and the creation of jobs, there is not always a direct correlation between site visits made and jobs created in any given year.  It is important also to acknowledge the natural time lag between a decision being made to invest and that investment coming on stream.  The time lag can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and the recruitment and training of suitable staff.</p>  <p>  The level of investment coming on stream is best captured in the number of jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Annual Employment Survey which shows that employment in IDA Ireland Client companies in Donegal rose from 2,106 in 2011 to 2,612 in 2014 an increase of over 20%.  Indeed, the Quarterly Household Survey shows that in the past two years unemployment in the Border area, which includes Donegal, has fallen from 16.5% in Q4 2012 to 10% in Q4 2014.</p>  <p>  As a Government, we are determined to ensure that every region in the country will benefit from recovery and we recently announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs-Regional initiative which will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of each region to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The objective is that six Regional Action Plans will be launched by July, with two remaining Strategies in development at that stage.</p>  <p>  Additionally the Government will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional capital funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by IDA Ireland to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.  This programme will build on the recent investment in or by delivery of a number of advance manufacturing and office facilities by the Agency in regional locations, including Letterkenny.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.</p>  <p>  I also recently launched IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy for the 5 year period 2015 to 2019.  In that Strategy the Agency set itself a target of winning 900 investments over the 5 year period and of increasing increase the level of investments won into in each region by between 30% and 40% during the lifetime of the Strategy.</p></reply>

The areas as described, excluding established scrub and ungrazed heather will, in general terms, be eligible under the Basic Payment Scheme provided there is evidence of an agricultural activity being carried out. In reality, such areas were already eligible in Ireland under the Single Payment Scheme provided that there was a farming activity on the land and this remains the position under the Basic Payment Scheme.  The agricultural activity required must be appropriate to the type of land involved and should ensure that the area eligible for payment remains in this state.</p></reply>

This is known as<i>force majeure </i>or exceptional circumstances.  These circumstances can take into account the impact of weather conditions including damage caused by storms.  Where such cases arise, they are examined on their individual merits and where circumstances allow, my Departmental will apply<i>force majeure </i>where non-compliances are caused by factors beyond the farmer&rsquo;s control.  Where temporary damage has, for example, been caused as a result of storms, the farmers involved are given the opportunity and sufficient time to undertake any remedial works necessary to rectify the non-compliance.  Following the severe storms in early 2014, my Department made it clear to farmers that this was the position.</p><p>If the damage was permanent, the farmers will be impacted in the future as the new payment entitlements to be granted to farmers this year will be based on the number of hectares declared in 2013 or 2015, whichever is the lower.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.</p>  <p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe met the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.</p>  <p>  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. The review increased the overall proportion of fish which could be caught in the sentinel fishery from 8% to 11%. The outcome of the rebuilding plan has meant that the overall Celtic Sea herring quota has increased from a low of 6,000 tonnes in 2009 to a quota of over 13,000 tonnes for 2015.</p>  <p>  The issues which the named individual has raised in connection with this policy are complex and are currently being examined in the Department. </p></reply>

EU Regulation No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) sets out the breakdown of EU support for rural development for each Member State for the years 2014 &ndash; 2020. Ireland&rsquo;s total EAFRD allocation for rural development is some &euro;2.19 billion (or some &euro;313 million per annum), as agreed at the EU Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) negotiations in 2013. EU funding amounts are combined with national co-funding to provide for each Member State&rsquo;s RDP. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, National Exchequer funding brings the total to be spent on RDP schemes in the 2014-2020 period to some &euro;4 billion.</p>  <p>  The MFF is subject to a formal amendment process at EU level for RDPs   approved in 2015. However, the average amount of EU support per annum remains the same.

I especially noted the statement therein, to which the Deputy refers, that employment in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries dropped by 10,900 or 9.3% since Q4 2013. I would caution, however, that these figures should be viewed in the context of the following caveat provided by the CSO, the first paragraph of which is included in the release itself:</p>  <p>  After each Census of Population the sample of households for the QNHS is updated to ensure the sample remains representative.  The new sample based on the 2011 Census of Population was introduced incrementally from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013.  This change in sample can lead to some level of variability in estimates, particularly at more detailed levels and some caution is warranted in the interpretation of trends over the period of its introduction.  The first year on year comparisons for quarters based entirely on the new sample are therefore available as of Q4 2014.</p>  <p>  However, as the QNHS is a sample survey, there is a level of variance associated with the estimates produced from the QNHS. In the case of the Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector it can be noted that the CSO estimates that the standard error measure associated with employment in this sector was 4,800 in Q4 2014 and this should be borne in mind when considering the employment levels for this sector.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the estimate for Q4 2013 was particularly high, again likely due to sampling issues, which further skews this particular year-on-year comparison.</p>  <p>  We have been in regular contact with the CSO over recent years, and will continue to be so, in an effort to gain greater insight into the figures for employment in the sector. The CSO recently indicated that they intend to revisit the data published since the 2011 Census of Population with a view to producing revised figures for this period.</p></reply>

Successful applicants will potentially be eligible for an allocation of entitlements at the National Average value on land for which they hold no entitlements (on the basis of 1 entitlement for 1 hectare of eligible land declared).  In respect of existing owned entitlements with a value below the National Average, they will potentially receive a top up whereby the value of those entitlements will be increased to the National Average value.  The allocation of entitlements and the top-up to the value of existing entitlements is subject to a maximum of 90. A successful applicant under the Young Farmers Scheme will receive payment under the Scheme for a maximum period of five years based on their date of setting up the holding.</p><p>With regard to Pillar II the following is relevant: </p><p><b><i>Pillar II - Rural Development Programme</i></b></p><p>One of the proposals in Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020, which is now with the EU Commission for approval, is an enhanced capital investment scheme for young farmers under the TAMS measures.  The new scheme will offer a specific grant rate of 60 per cent compared to the standard grant rate of 40 per cent which will be generally available under other on-farm investment schemes.The specific areas of investment available to young farmers will include animal housing, slurry storage, dairy equipment, specialised slurry spreading equipment, animal welfare and farm safety, and specialised pig and poultry investments, as well as capital investments for organic farmers.In addition, young farmers will be able to avail of grant-aid for construction of new dairy buildings.  Young farmers farming in a partnership, including a partnership with a parent, registered with my Department will also be able to avail of the full suite of investments under this Scheme and also avail of a doubling of the investment ceiling. The EU Commission approval referred to above will be required before any new national measures are introduced on the basis of the Programme.  It is expected that approval from the EU Commission will issue shortly. </p><p><b><i>Areas of Natural Constraint</i></b></p><p>Under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, which has replaced the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, special provision is made for applicants, who are in a partnership, registered under Irish National Regulations. The payment to the partnership under that Scheme will comprise of total of individual calculations based on the area of ANC land each partner contributes to the partnership.

However, pursuant to relevant legislation, the Irish Red Cross Society is an independent charitable body corporate with full power to manage and administer its own affairs and accordingly the reasons for the three resignations are entirely a matter for the Society itself. </p>  <p>  In recent years the Society has reformed its corporate governance structures and now has in place a governance framework that meets the standards set by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The reforms introduced were facilitated by the legislative amendments made by this Government in 2012 which represented the most wide ranging and fundamental set of changes to have occurred since the establishment of the Society in 1939.  Furthermore, in accordance with a Programme for Government commitment, my Department is continuing to progress a legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Irish Red Cross to further underpin the independence of the Society and I anticipate that this will result in a new Red Cross Bill.</p>  <p>  The Departmental Official who is a member of the Irish Red Cross Executive Board regularly keeps the Minister informed of developments in the Society.</p></reply>

Persons who consider they have been discriminated against can bring a complaint to the Equality Tribunal for adjudication and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission can provide advice and assistance to persons wishing to bring such a case.</p><p>I cannot comment on the specifics of any individual case as reported in the media or offer advice by way of answer to a Parliamentary Question or otherwise to any of the parties.  However, I do want to make a general comment about the importance of an open and welcoming attitude to the many new citizens and new communities that we have in Ireland.  In social and cultural terms, the diverse nature of our migrant population, representing as it does people from approximately 200 different countries, exposes us to experiences of new communities coming from a wealth of diverse backgrounds and enriches our society and culture.  Indeed, increased linguistic competence in our society has a direct and positive impact on our foreign trade relations and accordingly on employment in Ireland.  Exposure to different languages helps us to develop a greater understanding of other cultures and the richness and diversity they can offer.  It also helps us as a nation, and as individuals, to appreciate and value in a deeper way those elements of Irish culture which help define us as a nation.  Ireland&rsquo;s changing demographic over the last 10 years has helped to shape a more socially and culturally diverse society and there is no doubt that Ireland will remain a diverse society into the future.  Accordingly, it important that we celebrate and harness this diversity and ensure that our communities, our businesses and our schools are inclusive.</p></reply>

I understand the gun company subsequently went into liquidation and the proof house at the Institute for Industrial Research Standards (IIRS) - the predecessor to the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) -  ceased to function at the same time. </p>  <p>  Firearms proofing is a safety matter with regard to the production and use of a firearm and is normally carried out at the point of manufacture.  To establish a proof house in Ireland is a matter ultimately for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Such a measure would only be viable if there was a domestic manufacturer of firearms.  </p>  <p>  Many firearms imported into Ireland come from the 14 countries which are members of the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'&eacute;preuve des armes &agrave; feu portatives (CIP).  This means the firearms produced in those countries have a CIP proof mark, which essentially relates to a common standard for mutual recognition of proof marks.  Countries such as America and Canada are not members of CIP and their manufacturers test and proof mark their firearms according to their own standards.  Firearms from these non CIP countries are imported into Ireland.  Responsibility concerning product safety of firearms is a matter for manufacturers, the individual consumer and the firearms dealer who imports firearms.  Many EU countries, including Ireland, do not have domestic firearms production, and are not members of the CIP.  In the absence of sector specific EU legislation on the product safety of firearms, the  product and consumer safety issues relating to firearms fall under the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) 2001/95/EC of the European Commission.  The responsibility for the implementation of this Directive (including related market surveillance and enforcement issues) rests with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. </p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. At 22 February, 2015 there were 4,435 persons residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA.</p><p>The Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016 contains a number of commitments in the area of asylum. One of these commitments was to establish an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements to the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers. The terms of reference and Membership of the Working Group - chaired by retired Judge, Bryan McMahon - were announced in October 2014 and these can be found on the website of the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency - www.ria.gov.ie.  Membership of the Working group includes the Department of Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs, Tusla (the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency) and the Children's Rights Alliance. The Working Group is expected to present its report shortly.</p><p>A further commitment in the Statement of Government Priorities is to introduce an International Protection Bill to establish a single application procedure. Work on the Bill is ongoing in the Department and the expectation is that the Heads of the Bill will be submitted to Government in the coming weeks.</p><p>In relation to child protection at direct provision centres, it should firstly be noted that parents who live in direct provision centres have the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of their children who reside with them.  The safety of all residents &ndash; especially children &ndash; is at the forefront of RIA&rsquo;s objectives. RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children.  RIA is compliant with all legislative requirements in this area. RIA has a fully staffed Child and Family Services Unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system.  The Unit also acts as a conduit between RIA and the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the latter having statutory responsibility in this area.</p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy is based on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' &ldquo;Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children&rdquo;.  This guidance document was developed to assist people in identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns.  The protection and welfare policy emphasises that the needs of children and families must be central to child care and child protection and welfare.  RIA's policy was reviewed and updated in 2014 and now contains a practice document to make it more user friendly. This document is published on RIA&rsquo;s website .</p><p>Each accommodation centre has a designated Child Protection Liaison Person who has undertaken Children First &ndash; Keeping Safe Training.  When a child protection or welfare incident arises in a RIA centre it is the function of that Liaison Person to contact the local Social Work Team to inform it of his or her concern and to liaise with the RIA Child and Family Services Unit.</p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy complements other policies and procedures in place, viz:</p><p>- Garda Vetting Policy. All staff in centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.</p><p>- Complaints Policy. Complaints by centre residents are dealt with in accordance with the procedures outlined in RIA's Accommodation Centre Services, Rules and Procedures (House Rules), a copy of which is provided to all residents and sets out, inter alia, the obligations placed both on the centre manager and the resident.</p><p>- RIA Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding RIA residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment.</p><p>- RIA Code of Practice for Persons Working in Accommodation Centres and RIA Staff.</p><p>- Policy on Accommodation of Aged Out Minors in RIA Accommodation Centres.</p><p>In relation to any allegations of persons engaging in prostitution or other criminal activities, anyone with information of this nature should report their evidence to the Garda&iacute; who are responsible for the investigation of criminal matters. Should evidence of such illegal activity come to the attention of staff in Direct Provision centres or to RIA directly, that evidence would of course be referred to the Garda&iacute; for investigation.</p></reply>

The information for 2015 is not readily available.  I will forward the information to the Deputy as soon as it is to hand.</p><p>In the case of 2014, these figures are provisional pending the publication of the Irish Prison Service Annual Report 2014 which is subject to change.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Persons</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>6,727</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>7,476</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>7,365</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>8,140</td></tr></table></p><p>I can advise the Deputy that the number of such persons held in custody at any one time is a tiny fraction of the overall prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, on 9 March, 2015, 6 people, 0.16 percent, out of a prison population of 3,763 in custody that day fell into this category.</p><p>In terms of the fines Act I wish to advise the Deputy that the aim of the legislation is to seek to effectively eliminate, in so far as is possible, the need for judges to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of a fine. As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.</p><p>Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act. The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.</p><p>In relation to the introduction of payment of fines by instalment, a decision was taken to outsource all aspects of the recovery of fines to an external provider. The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices. There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.</p><p>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015. While it is desirable that the Act be commenced as soon as possible, it is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.</p></reply>

I am working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding to burglary in the Dublin area through Operation Acer, which is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR).  This includes a particular focus on identifying and targeting criminal groups who have played a large part in the recent increase.  Burglary Response Units attached to each Division take the lead in Operation Acer and are assisted by other units as required. In addition, a further and related operation, Operation Creeper, assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements and this Operation has been tasked solely with targeting burglary suspects which has resulted in the successful arrests of Acer targets.  These Operations are co-ordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary crime.</p>  <p>  Since Operation Acer commenced in early 2012, I am advised that there has been 5,389 arrests, 2,746 charges and 1,087 convictions for burglary in the Dublin area, up to 3 February 2015.</p>  <p>  In addition to these policing responses, I am also carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.  Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am committed to tackling it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.</p></reply>

There is an effective immigration and visa system in place for those who wish to migrate to the State for employment purposes. Any change in current policy would need to have regard to the large number of people currently unemployed in the state.</p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged that the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process is a matter that needs to be addressed and the Deputy may be aware that an Independent Working Group was established in October 2014 to recommend to the Government what improvements should be made to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers. The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon and is due to report to Government with its recommendations by April 2015. One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure.</p>  <p>  With regard to protection legislation my objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of direct provision for lengthy periods of time.  The introduction of a single procedure by way of a Protection Bill will enhance our capacity to deal efficiently with international protection applications, granting protection status to those who are entitled to it and identifying more quickly persons who have no entitlement to such status and who can safely return to their country of origin. I intend to publish the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill once it has been approved by Government.</p></reply>

The project was originally put in place as a pilot for a 12 month period and a comprehensive review of the service was undertaken in March 2012 incorporating an independent evaluation which was submitted to my predecessor.</p>  <p>  This review concluded that</p>  <p>  - There are clear cost benefits arising from the initiative and these benefits would be increased significantly if the initiative were extended.</p>  <p>  - There are considerable individual, system and societal benefits to this approach.</p>  <p>  - Based on international experience this approach has the potential to have a significant impact for people involved in family disputes</p>  <p>  - Benefits extend beyond the parties to the dispute, notably to children, families and society as a whole.</p>  <p>  - It also has the potential to impact significantly on the administration of justice in family law cases. It can impact on the number of cases going through the courts system.</p>  <p>  - It has the real potential to speed up the resolution of disputes and to do so more cheaply than through the courts process.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of the review my predecessor determined that the Dolphin House mediation service should be placed on a permanent footing and sanction was granted in due course to appoint 4 full time staff (8 part time positions). Following interviews held in May 2014 by the Legal Aid Board the permanent mediator positions were filled.</p>  <p>  To date there have been a total of 1,389 agreements reached between couples attending mediation. Agreements have included parenting plans (custody and access arrangements) as well as agreements on guardianship and financial matters. Additional pilot projects have been developed in other courts around the country - in Limerick and Cork one day each week as well as in Clonmel and Nenagh when the family court is sitting and in Naas for two days each week.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the Legal Aid Board's pro-active approach to offering integrated mediation services in cooperation with the Courts Service.  I am also pleased to note that the Board&rsquo;s new Corporate Plan for the period 2015 &ndash; 2017 contains commitments to continue to develop more cost effective methods of service delivery, including the full exploitation of the potential to utilise non-legal means of resolving disputes. This approach is fully consistent with Government policy to, where possible, utilise mediation for resolving disputes that would otherwise end up being addressed through litigation which is more costly and, in the case of family law disputes, frequently much more traumatic for the parties involved.</p></reply>

Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and in keeping with the Garda Commissioner's recommendation, a separate volume of the report was not published as it contains extensive personal information including information which may be the subject of further investigation.  In light of this, the publication of a heavily redacted version of the report would not have been straightforward and would not have added to overall understanding of the issues concerned. </p>  <p>  Insofar as the recommendations with respect to certain legislative and related cross-cutting aspects of the fixed charge processing system outlined in the report are concerned, I have referred these to the Criminal Justice (FCPS) Working Group for further examination.

This unprecedented decision was taken with a view to getting an objective and independent legal view on whether further action might be warranted in any case.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, a panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The independent review is well underway and 316 cases have been referred to the Panel. The volume and complexity of cases has led to the review taking somewhat longer than originally anticipated, but it is important that counsel take the time necessary to consider each case fully and carefully.  Counsel are making every effort to conclude their work as soon as is reasonably practicable.</p><p>The review in each case consists of an examination of the papers by independent counsel, who then make a recommendation as to whether any further action might be taken. [I know that some Deputies have argued that the review should have involved interviews with the complainants and other relevant persons, but with respect I think that is to misunderstand this process.] The purpose of the review is to triage the allegations to see if further investigations are needed. To have required counsel to hold hearings where they would interview everyone concerned would in effect have been to hold full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical. </p><p>The Panel is an independent body of counsel and the method of review is a matter for senior counsel who, in addition to examining individual complaints, are required to advise the Department generally on the management of the process, take a joint lead in allocating cases to junior counsel, and jointly oversee recommendations with a view to ensuring as far as possible a consistency of approach, except of course where a potential conflict of interest might arise. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that if there is any conflict, or potential conflict, the conflicted counsel not only will not be involved in the particular complaint, but also will not be aware of which counsel is reviewing it. This is normal professional conduct and there are sufficient counsel on the Panel to ensure the practicality of this.  Whatever steps are necessary will be taken to ensure there is no conflict of interest.  </p><p>Counsel will not be making decisions, but rather making<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>recommendations, and the question of appeals does not therefore arise.The recommendation in each case is a matter for counsel.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.However, I would also make the point that in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken. This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.</p><p>Consideration is currently being finalised in relation to the format and content of replies to complainants, and the objective will be to ensure that each complainant receives as comprehensive an answer as possible.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

My primary concern, in introducing these provisions, is to vindicate the human rights of those trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Over 80% of women trafficked are the victims of sexual exploitation.</p><p>These proposals were developed following an extensive consultation process, initiated by my Department in 2012, including a Discussion Document which presented an objective analysis of the approaches adopted in other jurisdictions to address prostitution.  I would draw attention to a March 2014 Council of Europe Report entitled &quot;Prostitution, trafficking and modern slavery in Europe&quot;.  That Report reviews the approaches adopted in a number of countries and concludes that member states should consider &quot;criminalising the purchase of sexual services, based on the Swedish model, as the most effective tool for preventing and combating trafficking in human beings&quot;. In February 2014, the European Parliament adopted a resolution advocating this approach.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has also recommended criminalising the purchase of sexual services by means of prostitution. </p><p>Independent statistics on crime, including prostitution and related offences, are collated and published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  In addition to the work of the CSO, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of my Department publishes annual reports setting out statistical information on alleged victims of human trafficking encountered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, International Organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations working in the field.  The information is disaggregated by gender, age, region of origin and type of exploitation.  The Annual Reports also provides information on the criminal justice response to human trafficking in Ireland.  The reports are available on Ireland's dedicated anti-human trafficking website www.blueblindfold.gov.ie and on my Department's website.  The question of enhancing the knowledge base and data in relation to human trafficking in Ireland will be examined in the context of the 2nd National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Human Beings in Ireland which is currently being drafted.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>The purpose of the new offences is to send a clear message that the purchase of sexual services in the context of prostitution is unlawful and the evidence suggests that making an act unlawful does in itself influence behaviour.  There will of course be some prosecutions and of course as with any covert activity, this can present challenges.The Deputy however will appreciate that this is an operational policing matter and one which will properly be dealt with by the Garda authorities, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.  The trafficking of persons and the organisation of prostitution is a feature of organised criminality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already strongly committed to the disruption of the organised crime networks behind this activity. <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>This includes utilising a multi-agency approach to tackle those involved in organising this type of criminal activity including liaison with the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>The Garda&iacute; also implement specific targeted operations as required and have been successful in obtaining convictions for organising prostitution, brothel keeping and associated offences.  All relevant current legislation is utilised by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to target and dismantle the criminal groups involved in this sort of criminality and I have no doubt that the Garda&iacute; will also make effective use of the new provisions in the same context. </p></reply>

A Cross-Departmental Group on Integration was reconstituted in March, 2014 with a mandate to review the activities being undertaken by Government Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of migrants, preparing a Draft Integration Strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented, and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders. A public consultation process was subsequently launched on 28 March 2014 as part of the review. Over eighty submissions were received from stakeholders, a large number of whom have now met with the Cross-Departmental Group on Integration. The Cross-Departmental Group has also held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism.

As the Inspectorate report recognises, these issues have been reported in other police services and the Inspectorate's recommendations draw from measures introduced in those jurisdictions.</p><p>It is of course of great importance that police data is as accurate as can be and this is reflected in the steps taken by the Garda Commissioner to respond to the concerns identified in the Inspectorate report, including the establishment of a new Data Quality Team in the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), as well as measures to strengthen PULSE governance arrangements.  These measures form part of broader steps to take forward the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations, including plans to upgrade and improve the technology for recording of crime and policing activity.</p><p>In so far as the compilation and publication of crime statistics is concerned, this is a matter in the first instance for the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency.  The CSO is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Inspectorate in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<i>.</i>I understand that substantial work has been carried out on this project since the report's publication, and that this work is ongoing.</p><p>In addition, the CSO has also agreed to chair an expert panel to examine the Inspectorate's recommendations on crime statistics.<i></i>The expert panel will review the crime counting and detection rules, as recommended by the Inspectorate, with a view to introducing new national standards.  I am advised that the expert panel will commence its work in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Responsibility for 16 year old boys was transferred from the adult prison system to the Oberstown campus in May 2012 and this commitment will be fully met when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools.</p><p>The Oberstown capital development project, which commenced on site in September 2013, will enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all under 18 year olds ordered to be detained by the courts on criminal justice charges.  The first 5 units of new residential accommodation have been handed over to the Oberstown campus.  In order to ensure safe and secure custody of children in the new buildings, and to meet the appropriate health and safety standards, a period of testing of new equipment and fittings and staff training is required.  This process is continuing and is due to be completed shortly.</p><p>In order to transfer responsibility for all 17 year old boys, there is a need to employ the required complement of new care staff to work in the expanded facilities, and enact the necessary legislation to ensure that all legal issues are fully addressed.  A campaign is ongoing to recruit over 60 new care staff for the operation of the expanded Oberstown campus and 38 staff have been recruited to date.  My Department is also progressing the necessary legal changes required in order to transfer responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities by amending the Children Act 2001.  It is intended that the Bill to give effect to these amendments will be published as soon as possible and enacted without delay.</p><p>When these steps have been achieved the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities will cease, as early as possible this year.</p></reply>

This programme represents an annual investment of &euro;175 million in pre-school services.</p><p>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current provision.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision, which is key to good outcomes for children, should be the priority.  The Early Years Quality Agenda is being progressed by my Department.  This involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime.  These reforms are key building blocks for any further extension of universal childcare provision.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development.  The Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the Framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.</p></reply>

Special care is used to address the risk of harm that may be caused to a child's life, health, safety, development or welfare by their behaviour.  Children are admitted to Special Care following a successful application to the Child and Family Agency's Special Care Admissions Committee and then to the High Court for a special care order, in line with the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended.</p>  <p>  The criteria for admission to a special care unit are the age of the child, the concerns and risk assessment of the child, and a risk management plan.  The age range for admission is 11 to 17 years.  The concern and risk assessment must show evidence of the risk of harm that is posed by the child's behaviour.  The risk management plan must show that the admission to special care will benefit the child and is being sought as other interventions or alternate placements are not able to meet the specific needs of the child.  Documentation to support and provide evidence for the application are also considered and includes a special care application form, views of the child and the parents/guardians, the history leading to the application, the child's social history and details of previous placements.</p>  <p>  The current capacity of the three special care units is 17 places and as of the 31 December 2014, 16 children were in special care placements.  The Agency has informed me that for 2014, there were 67 referrals, 16 re-referrals which gives a total of 83 referrals for special care interventions in the year.  I have been informed that currently there are 7 young people who have been approved but are awaiting a special care intervention.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children annually.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the School Completion Programme programme was funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan and up to 2007, with assistance from the European Social Fund.  In 2006/2007, the School Completion Programme was subsumed into the School Support Programme, under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) at the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  In May 2009, the remit of the then National Educational Welfare Board was extended to include a co-ordinating role in relation to the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme alongside the Board's statutory Educational Welfare Service in order to develop an integrated and model of service to respond to children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  When my Department was established in 2011, it was given a remit to lead the development of harmonised policy and quality integrated service delivery for children and young people, to carry out specific functions in the social care field and co-ordinate actions across a range of sectors, including health, education, youth justice, sport, arts and culture in support of improved outcomes for children and young people.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency was established as the dedicated State Agency for improving wellbeing  and outcomes for children under the remit of my Department.  Operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects was assigned to the Agency from that date.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million was provided for the School Completion Programme.  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year.  The first two instalments of 2014/15 funding have been  issued to local projects, with a third instalment planned for payment in May 2015.</p>  <p>  The objective in incorporating the School Completion Programme into the Child and Family Agency responsibility is to ensure the provision of effective services for children who have difficulties participating in school; to better integrate the educational welfare services with other support services for children and their families and to bring about an increased emphasis on planning, evidence based services and outcome measurement.</p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.  My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.  This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan.</p>  <p>  The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in light of the monies available.</p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme by the ESRI is almost complete.  The review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and to ensure that it is line with the aims of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people (2014-2020).</p>  <p>  The aim is to ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage.  The Review has an important contribution to make to these aims and the future development of the school completion programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed shortly.</p></reply>

These include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides for a  free preschool year;  the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme to support low income and disadvantaged families, and three Training and Employment Childcare programmes - Childcare Education and Training programme (CETS), Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme and After-school Childcare (ASCC) programme - which provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work or to education.</p>  <p>  The Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP) initiative was recently introduced by my Department with the objective of reducing paperwork and duplication of effort and to simplify the administration process of all of the programmes.  This new development provides a more comprehensive, integrated set of management processes, more efficient work practices, greater visibility and control of funds and commitments and substantially improves the capacity of the stakeholders to dynamically manage service by service and case by case approvals and changes in each of the programmes.</p>  <p>  The introduction of any new technical infrastructure does create some difficulties which are often resolved when users become more familiar with the operational processes.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and Pobal are working to further streamline the processes and I am confident that when all users become fully familiar with the system, it will prove to be extremely beneficial and efficient and will significantly improve the situation for service providers.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>   In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. </p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014. The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering.  These engagements have been completed and the HSE is now considering the outcome of those commercial engagements.

It recommends, broadly, a move away from the traditional institutional based model of care to a more patient-centred, flexible and community based service, where the need for hospital admission is greatly reduced while still providing in-patient care, as appropriate.  This Government has prioritised the reform and resourcing of our mental health services in line with<i>Vision,</i>and has significantly progressed this through the provision of &euro;125 million since 2012 to underpin a range of new service initiatives to meet this widely agreed strategy objective.  </p><p>A great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes the development of child and adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.</p><p><i>A Vision for Change </i>indicates a requirement for 10,647 WTE staff which, when adjusted for population growth, equates to around 12,240 WTE staff by 2016.  However, given the changed economic circumstances since its publication, the Government has had to reduce the numbers employed across the public service in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  While staffing levels in the mental health service have fallen, there are positives that must be acknowledged.  Many of the staff numbers lost were supporting the excessive numbers of beds which are no longer part of the service user recovery focused, modern, community based model for mental health.  The overall reduction in numbers has been mitigated due to the priority ring-fenced Programme for Government investments since 2012.  This has allowed the HSE to begin to re-balance the staff skill mix in mental health and to introduce new staff in the historically under represented disciplines recommended in <i>A Vision for Change </i>i.e. psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.</p><p>The sustained investment in mental health since 2012 has resulted in over 1,150 new staff for the sector.  As at the end of December 2014, of the 416 approved posts in 2012, approximately 95% (397) are now filled. Of the 477 approved posts in 2013, 78% (367) are filled.  Therefore, approximately 86% of the combined posts over 2012-13 have taken up duty.  The remainder of the vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment, with some difficulties in identifying outstanding candidates, primarily for geographic and qualification reasons.  The recruitment of 225 approved allocated posts for 2014 has commenced with 4 having agreed start dates, a further 5 posts have been accepted, and the remaining posts are at various stages of the recruitment process.  Discussions are currently taking place between the Department of Health and the HSE on the final allocation of the additional &euro;35 million provided for mental health in Budget 2015.  I hope to finalise the allocation of the additional funds with the HSE in the very near future.</p><p>It is acknowledged that in recent years, the retention of staff in the mental health service has been challenging, with the numbers employed fluctuating due to departures for various reasons, including redundancy, retirement or staff moving to take up employment elsewhere. However, the recruitment of these new posts, while challenging in the current environment, has enabled the gradual decline in posts to be arrested.</p></reply>

This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.</p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) Service is a national service provided under the governance framework of the National Counselling Service (NCS) within the Mental Health Division.  It is being funded from the Programme for Government investment in Mental Health, to increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and supplement existing services provided by Primary Care.  Since 2012, this Government has provided funding totalling &euro;7.5 million to develop the CIPC service.  The service provides short term counselling for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 and over and who hold a valid medical card. Referral into the service is by the person&rsquo;s GP or other member of the Primary Care Team.  The establishment of the CIPC initiative is aimed at providing a more immediate response to wider community for persons in need of counselling and advice.  If deemed necessary, persons presenting with more serious crisis issues can be referred on to the appropriate HSE community mental health services.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made to see people as quickly as possible, however, there are a number of people waiting extended periods for counselling within the CIPC service, many of whom will have specific requirements, for example can only attend on a specific day or time or may wish to be seen in a particular area.  In some areas, there is particular difficulty for services accessing accommodation in which to see clients, which in turn impacts on waiting times.</p>  <p>  The provision of a quality counselling service across both primary and secondary care will be developed further, as resources permit.

As Minister for Health, I have overall responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy at Government level.  The Oversight Forum on Drugs, which I chair, is responsible for the high-level monitoring of the Strategy, and solid  progress is being made in delivering on its objectives across the five pillars of treatment, rehabilitation, prevention, supply reduction and research.</p>  <p>  Drug law enforcement remains a key priority for the Government.  Drug seizures play a critical role in disrupting crime gangs and in helping to protect communities from the destructive impact of drugs misuse and associated criminality.  Drug seizures valued at approximately &euro;62m were made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during 2014.  This does not include a joint operation involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue Customs Service and the Naval Service which led to the interception of a yacht off Ireland's south-west coast in September 2014 containing cocaine with an estimated street value at that time of over &euro;70m.</p>  <p>  There have been marked improvements in access to treatment services.  At the end of December 2014, 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment, and 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week of assessment.  There is much wider coverage of needle exchange services outside the Dublin area, with more than 130 community pharmacies recruited and trained.  In a major effort to reduce drug-related deaths, the HSE is undertaking a pilot project to make the life-saving drug naloxone more widely available to treat overdoses.  Naloxone reverses the effects of drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone if someone overdoses.</p>  <p>  The budget of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces has also been protected, with &euro;29m provided for local drugs initiatives this year.  An additional  &euro;2.1m has been provided in the HSE budget this year for measures targeting vulnerable problem drug users, including enhanced residential detoxification and rehabilitation facilities.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with my colleagues across Government to ensure full implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  My Department is beginning work on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period after 2016.  The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.  It will also take account of evidence-based research, information and data sources on the extent and nature of problem drug use in Ireland.  As Minister with lead responsibility for drugs policy and Chair of the Oversight Forum on Drugs, I will play an active role in the development of the new Strategy and I look forward to engaging with all interested parties in this work.</p></reply>

These reviews will be completed in order to obtain detailed information and clarification on these important matters.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the HSE that new information has recently come to light from expert reports and following its consideration the HSE has ceased the temporary suspension of the self-employed community midwife's clinical indemnity insurance thereby allowing her to return to clinical practice.</p>  <p>  There were 12 mothers-to-be contracted to the self-employed community midwife for homebirths, at the time of her suspension.  Presently, all mothers have delivered of their babies.  The remaining mothers who were known to the person in question, but had not agreed a contract with the HSE, had been advised to make contact with a designated midwife officer in the HSE.</p>  <p>  As these matters may be the subject of further legal proceedings I am not in a position to make any further comment at this time.</p></reply>

The proposed strategy will set out policy direction for maternity services.  As a first step, a review of national and international literature on the organisation and delivery of maternity services was commissioned by the department.  That review examined <i>inter alia</i>models of maternity care in other jurisdictions including midwifery led care.  The literature review is currently informing the development of a high level policy paper.  Following the finalisation of this paper, a working group, with appropriate stakeholder representation, will be established with a view to completing the strategy in 2015.</p><p>The Deputy can be assured that my Department is committed to the principle of choice for women in the area of child birth.  In that regard the issue of stand-alone birth centres in the community is among the matters to be considered in the context of the development of the forthcoming strategy.  The HSE currently facilitates a home birth service to eligible expectant mothers who choose to have a home birth under the care of a self-employed community midwife.  This service is provided on behalf of the HSE.  The community midwife signs a Memorandum of Understanding with the HSE and agrees to be bound by its terms.</p></reply>

Among the priority areas identified for the health sector is the commitment to &ldquo;modernise health facilities&rdquo;.  This area encompasses a range of key actions, including the development of primary care centres.</p>  <p>  One of the measures being undertaken to deliver on this action is a research project to identify and assess the various options, including tax incentives, available to Government to encourage the provision, including the upgrading and refurbishment, of primary care centres in areas where they are needed.  My Department has initiated a public procurement process to obtain expertise for this research project and I expect to receive a report on the matter later this year.</p>  <p>  Primary care is central to delivering a sustainable universal healthcare system, where care is provided at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to home as possible.  The development of necessary infrastructure will address capacity in this area and support the delivery of integrated, multi-disciplinary primary care.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and  the HSE is currently finalising an action plan under the auspices of the ED Taskforce with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority has not published a specific report on the conditions of elderly and sick persons left on trolleys in hospitals; however the Authority has published a number of reports which have identified concerns and issues surrounding the use of hospital trolleys, and has made recommendations in respect of this.  The recommendations contained in these reports are relevant across the hospital sector.</p>  <p>  As the service provider, the HSE is responsible and accountable for ensuring that the appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure a safe quality service for patients.  The HSE advises that the implementation of the recommendations of the HIQA Tallaght Report of 2012 is ongoing, with many of the recommendations now incorporated into the hospital governance, leadership, management and clinical processes.  The ongoing implementation of this report also takes account of the recommendations of the Mallow &amp;amp; Ennis HIQA reports, relevant legislation &amp;amp; regulation and the HSE National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.842.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000079#WRS02000"><p>Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borelliosis, is an infection caused by a bacterium (<i>Borrelia burgdorferi)</i>.  It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacterium.  Lyme borelliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011.</p><p>Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no <i>erythema migrans </i>rash.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to <i>B. burgdorferi</i>produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step. Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.</p><p>Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks. If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may need to be used.</p><p>The standard approach to treatment of Lyme borelliosis is to follow the guidance laid out in the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on the <i>Clinical Assessment, Treatment, and Prevention of Lyme Disease, Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis, and Babesiosis: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America</i>.  This is accepted as being the most up to date synthesis of best available evidence on the clinical management of Lyme borelliosis. Treatment of Lyme borelliosis in Ireland is based upon this guidance.</p><p>A consensus statement on the clinical management of Lyme borelliosis was been issued jointly from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners in November, 2012 supporting the use of this guidance.</p><p>There were 20 cases notified in 2013 and 20 notified cases in 2014, it is expected that this figure will reduce on validation. In the first seven weeks of 2015, two cases have been notified compared to 4 for the first seven weeks of 2014.</p></reply>

Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all.   </p>  <p>  There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings. If an individual of any age buys health insurance during this time, no loadings will apply. From 1 May 2015 onwards, a credited period can apply where individuals previously had health insurance. In addition, a credited period (in total not exceeding 3 years) is also available for individuals who previously had health insurance but relinquished cover since 1 January 2008 due to unemployment. I attach a Frequently Asked Questions document prepared by my Department as a useful guide for information. The Health Insurance Authority website www.hia.ie contains additional information and includes an LCR calculator which provides a useful estimate of the level of loading that may apply.        </p>  <p>  Credit is given for any periods of in-patient cover from age 23 years onwards. The responsibility rests with the individual to prove to the insurer their entitlement to a credited period. An individual will be able to source a statement from their insurer (or previous insurers) for any recent periods of insurance cover, as policyholder information is normally held for a period of at least six years by an insurer to satisfy their responsibilities under various legislative requirements. Beyond this timeframe, the onus will be on individuals to provide evidence that satisfies an insurer of their previous in-patient cover. The level of loading to apply in an individual case will be dependent on an insurer satisfying itself of a person's entitlement to any credits being claimed, taking account of that individual's ability to document periods of historical insurance cover. The level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s).</p></reply>

I am deeply saddened by his death, and have extended my sympathy to his family. </p>  <p>  Mr. Nemtsov was a courageous champion of democratic reforms who fought tirelessly for a more open and tolerant Russia. His loss will be deeply felt not just in Russia, but around the world.</p>  <p>  The high esteem in which many Russians held Mr. Nemtsov was evident in the large crowds that attended a vigil in his honour on 1 March and his memorial service two days later, at which Ireland was represented by our Ambassador to Russia. Tens of thousands of people across a wide range of political parties and movements turned out to mourn his loss and pay tribute to his legacy as a fearless reformer who was not afraid to speak out against the direction that Russia was taking and the policies being pursued.  </p>  <p>  Mr. Nemtsov's murder highlights the vulnerability of opposition figures in Russia at the present time, where any criticism of government policy is seen by some as an act of disloyalty. He had been a vocal critic of Russia&rsquo;s actions against Ukraine. Indeed, the vigil held for Mr. Nemtsov replaced an opposition demonstration which he had been instrumental in organising to protest against the economic crisis and Russia&rsquo;s role in the destabilisation of Ukraine. </p>  <p>  President Putin has condemned the killing, and his spokesperson announced that the President had written to Mr. Nemtsov&rsquo;s mother promising that he would personally oversee the investigation into her son&rsquo;s murder. </p>  <p>  It is crucial that the Russian authorities promptly conduct a full and transparent investigation into his killing and that the perpetrators of this callous crime are brought to justice. A culture of impunity must not be allowed to develop in Russia.</p>  <p>  It is also important that the rights to freedom of assembly and expression that Mr. Nemtsov fought  to defend are recognised and fully protected, and that his fearless calls for reform and tolerance, echoed by those who mourn him, are heard and heeded. </p>  <p>  Recent developments in Russia in terms of political pluralism, the role of civil society and civil liberties have certainly been disappointing. Although our perspectives may sometimes differ, it is important that we should continue to engage with Russia on these key issues. </p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, reaffirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.  </p>  <p>  Our aim since 2011 has been to protect, as far as possible, allocations to for the aid programme. Despite the very difficult economic circumstances we faced over this period, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise allocations to the programme.   The OECD Development Assistance Committee&rsquo;s peer review of Ireland, published last December, clearly recognises  and commends our efforts to protect and stabilise the allocation for the aid programme, and describes as &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo; Ireland&lsquo;s approach in managing the aid budget during the economic crisis. The most recent statistics published by the OECD, for 2013, place Ireland&rsquo;s ODA at 0.46% of GNP.</p>  <p>  For 2015, we have again protected the overall allocations to the aid programme, and have provided a total of just over &euro;600 million for ODA.  Significantly, this represents a small increase on the 2014 level.   As our economic recovery consolidates and strengthens, I am determined to set out the strongest possible case for building further on our current commitment to the aid programme.   </p>  <p>  Our priority now is to ensure we continue to focus on tackling the root causes of poverty and injustice, strengthening our key partner countries ability to deliver essential services to their citizens, and delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest people and communities.</p></reply>

A new UN-led framework is now being negotiated to guide global efforts on international development to 2030. Ireland is co-facilitating these negotiations at the UN, with Kenya.  At the heart of the new development framework will be a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to complete the work under the MDGs and tackle new and emerging global challenges. The SDGs will aim at eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2030 and achieving sustainable development at a global level by addressing challenges in areas such as energy, food, water and sanitation, climate, consumption, employment and economic growth, urbanisation and governance.  The aim is that the new Goals will be universal in nature and address development challenges through social, environmental and economic actions in all countries, be they low, middle or high-income countries. </p>  <p>  The Addis Conference will seek to identify and unlock all available financing sources to implement the new SDGs. This will include aid, but will also have to broaden the agenda significantly beyond development assistance.  Its aim is to establish a durable and sustainable financial framework that will provide long-term support for the SDGs. </p>  <p>  The Conference, while acknowledging the importance of Official Development Aid (ODA) in contributing to sustainable development, will aim for a more ambitious and innovative approach. It will be universal in scope, allowing a move away from the traditional North-South model of development cooperation, and will recognise and encourage the role Middle Income Countries can play in contributing to sustainable development. The Conference will also examine ways of mobilising domestic tax revenues, a rapidly-growing source of stable development finance, and identify ways of creating an enabling environment to support private sector growth, both domestic and international, in an inclusive and sustainable way. The potential for ODA to act as a catalytic agent for other innovative finance and investment will also be explored. Ultimately, this transformative agenda aims to form a global partnership to eradicate poverty and support sustainable development.</p>  <p>  My Department has established an inter-departmental coordination mechanism comprising all relevant Government Departments to ensure a comprehensive Irish position for the Conference, and for the broader post-2015 development negotiations. We are engaging with a wide range of interested parties, including civil society, and we are working with our EU partners to agree a common EU position on the range of issues to be addressed at the Finance for Development Conference. </p>  <p>  Our objective is to contribute to a broad, ambitious and inclusive outcome in Addis that will ensure the success of the post-2015 negotiations at the United Nations and the effectiveness of the new Sustainable Development Goals. </p></reply>

It is hoped that the new development agenda will be adopted at the Summit planned for New York in September. At the heart of this new global sustainable development framework will be a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which will complete the work of the MDGs in eradicating extreme poverty but which will put sustainable development at the core.  The objective is that the SDGs will be universal in nature and address development challenges through social, environmental and economic actions in low, middle and high-income countries alike. They will address a wide range of areas including food and nutrition, water and sanitation, climate and biodiversity, production and consumption, trade and global governance structures, peace and governance, employment and economic growth, urbanisation and energy.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities for the post-2015 Development Agenda have been the fight to end hunger and under-nutrition, the promotion of gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment, and good governance and rule of law. These priorities are drawn from Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo; and the priorities set out following the Foreign Policy Review, in &lsquo;The Global Island&rsquo;, which I launched, with the Taoiseach, in January.  We have advocated for strong goals and targets in each of these key areas, and we have emphasised the need to incorporate human rights in the new development framework, reduce global inequality and protect the role of civil society. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s positions in the UN negotiations are agreed through a whole-of-Government coordination process. My Department, together with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government is co-chairing a dedicated inter-departmental coordination mechanism comprising all relevant Government Departments, to ensure a comprehensive Irish position. We are also engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society. </p>  <p>  We are working with our colleagues in the EU to ensure that the process will culminate in a successful outcome in September and that the new SDGs, which will have a profound impact on the lives of the world&rsquo;s poor, will reflect our priorities and galvanise action to end extreme poverty and hunger by 2030. </p>  <p>  This year will also see a global agreement on how to finance the new SDGs at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development which will take place in Addis Ababa from the 13-16 July. In addition a new agreement is being negotiated under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and is expected to be adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris in December. We believe that ensuring that these processes are coherent and mutually supportive is critical if we are to achieve a truly transformative agenda for sustainable development.    </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s policy on International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo; published in 2013 clearly articulates our vision for a sustainable and just world and the priority areas of focus for the Irish Aid programme.  The programme remains firmly focused on the reduction of poverty and hunger, on promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth in our partner countries in Africa, and on strengthening governance and accountability so that citizens can realise their rights.</p>  <p>  We have ensured that all expenditure under the aid programme is in line with the guidelines developed by international donors at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on what can be classified as Official Development Assistance (ODA).  These guidelines are essential in ensuring that aid is directed effectively at the eradication of poverty and hunger in the world.  We do not provide support to areas such as military or space exploration under the aid programme.  Such support would not fall under the objectives of the Irish Aid programme, and it would not be classified as ODA.</p>  <p>  In taking decisions on the allocation of funding across the Irish Aid programme, we take account of a range of criteria, including the potential impact on poverty and hunger, alignment with our development policy priorities, assessment of risk and where Ireland can have most influence.</p>  <p>  Ireland was commended last year in the peer review of our aid programme by the OECD Development Assistance Committee, which recognised that our &ldquo;Official Development Assistance allocations provide an excellent reflection of Ireland&rsquo;s  policy priorities to fight hunger and poverty for vulnerable people, as well as its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals and the least developed countries.&rdquo;</p></reply>

It is hoped that the new development agenda will be adopted at the Summit planned for New York in September.  At the heart of this new global sustainable development framework will be a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which will complete the work of the MDGs in eradicating extreme poverty but which will put sustainable development at the core.  The objective is that the SDGs will be universal in nature and address development challenges through social, environmental and economic actions in low, middle and high-income countries alike.  They will address a wide range of areas including food and nutrition, water and sanitation, climate and biodiversity, production and consumption, trade and global governance structures, peace and governance, employment and economic growth, urbanisation and energy.</p>  <p>  The Addis Conference therefore will seek to identify and unlock all the various financing sources, including, but not exclusively, aid, to implement the new SDGs.  Its aim is to establish a durable and sustainable financial framework that will provide long-term support for the SDGs.</p>  <p>  The Conference, will acknowledging the continuing importance of Official Development Aid (ODA) in contributing to sustainable development, and will aim for a more ambitious, broader and innovative approach to financing for development.  It will examine the role of Middle Income Countries, and ways of mobilising domestic tax revenues, a rapidly-growing source of stable development finance.  It will identify ways of creating an enabling environment to support private sector growth, both domestic and international, that is inclusive and sustainable.  The potential for ODA to act as a catalytic agent for other innovative finance and investment will also be explored.  Ultimately, this transformative agenda aims to form a global partnership to eradicate poverty and support sustainable development.</p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaged in these negotiations and is working closely at all levels with EU partners to agree a common EU position on the range of issues to be addressed at the Finance for Development Conference.</p>  <p>  We believe the commitment to provide 0.7% of GNP for ODA remains extremely important.  It is regarded as such by the developing countries which will participate in the Addis conference.  Since coming to office in 2011, the Government&rsquo;s aim has been to protect, as far as possible, allocations to for Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  Despite the very difficult economic circumstances we faced over this period, we have successfully managed to stabilise these allocations.  For 2015, we have again protected the overall allocations to the aid programme, and have provided a total of just over &euro;600 million for ODA.  Significantly, this represents a small increase on the 2014 level.  As our economic recovery consolidates and strengthens, I am determined to set out the strongest possible case for building further on our current commitment to the aid programme.</p>  <p>  The OECD Development Assistance Committee&rsquo;s peer review of Ireland, published last December, clearly recognises  and commends our efforts to protect and stabilise the allocation for the aid programme, and describes as &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo; Ireland&rsquo;s approach in managing the aid budget during the economic crisis.  The most recent statistics published by the OECD, for 2013, place Ireland&rsquo;s ODA at 0.46% of GNP.  I believe this provides us with a strong and credible basis for the negotiations in Addis and on the post-2015 development framework.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p><p>With effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be  made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.</p><p>With the exception of SNAs who have been re-employed on permanent contracts or have chosen to opt out of the panel in accordance with the terms of Paragraph 6 of the circular, all SNAs who have been made redundant since 1 May 2013 are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2014/2015 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0044/2014 which issued on 12 May 2014 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: .</p><p>It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including SNAs who were employed prior to 1 May 2013, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>When an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 12-18 of Circular 44/2014.</p><p>Finally, my Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in various geographical areas as required.</p>  <p>  SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.</p>  <p>  For young people with autism who continue to require special provision in a post-primary school there are special classes established across the area referred to by the Deputy.  There is also special provision in bordering areas.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that special classes are established where possible to avoid long commutes for children and to try to keep children within their community.  However, not all schools are in a position to establish such provision at a particular point in time.  SENOs, on behalf of the NCSE, are actively engaging with schools to establish additional provision where needed.  This includes classes at post primary level for pupils with autism based on current and predicted demand.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently considering applications by schools to establish new special classes for the coming 2015/16 school year.  The NCSE has advised that there are additional classes planned to commence in September 2015 in the area referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The HEA then apportions this requirement to the relevant Institutes of Technology.  Currently eleven Institutes of Technology provide the capacity to deliver Phase 4 and Phase 6 apprenticeship training.</p>  <p>  SOLAS is currently reviewing the capacity requirements for the 2015/16 academic year and is scheduled to meet the HEA shortly regarding the 2015/16 academic year requirements.  They expect that there will be an increase in the overall provision requirements for both Phase 4 and Phase 6.</p>  <p>  With regard to the membership of the Apprenticeship Council, it was considered by the Minister for Education and Skills, Jan O'Sullivan, that, as it was necessary to have a broad range of trade unions represented.  It was deemed appropriate to request ICTU to nominate two representatives for appointment to the Council.  They have since done so and membership of the Council has been finalised.</p>  <p>  One of the first tasks of the Council was to issue a call for proposals from consortia of enterprise sectors and education and training providers for the development of new apprenticeships.  This call was issued in January and is open until the end of March 2015.  The Apprenticeship Council also held an information day recently for relevant stakeholders in order to clarify any issues associated with the call for proposals.  In addition to their central role in relation to existing apprenticeships, it is hoped that Institutes of Technology will engage in the call for proposals process and participate strongly in the development and delivery of new apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Implementation Plan which was published last year sets out a clear roadmap for the planned actions to be implemented as part of the review of the apprenticeship system, which includes the establishment of the Apprenticeship Council, the review of existing apprenticeship curricula, the call for proposals, the development of new apprenticeships and the institution of overall governance arrangements for apprenticeship in Ireland.</p></reply>

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p><p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it they should indemnify the school.</p><p>  The Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.</p></reply>

It is the management authority that employs the school's teachers and other staff members. In ETB schools, the ETB is the employer. The school principal manages the school on a day to day basis.</p>  <p>  As my Department has no role in the employment of staff in schools or schools' day to day management, a complaint about the child's school and its staff is proper to the school itself.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, my Department does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of action with regard to individual complaint cases. In dealing with complaints, the Department's role is to provide advice to parents and students on the operation of schools' complaints procedures and to clarify for parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.</p>  <p>  Complaints from parents are often received by phone, and across all sections of the Department.  These are attended to contemporaneously in detail by telephone and are not logged.  It is therefore not possible to provide data in any accurate format as to how many such complaints have been received in the Department.</p>  <p>  The statutory role and functions of the Children's Ombudsman are set out under sections 8 and 9 of the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002. The Act empowers the Children's Ombudsman to investigate the administrative procedures followed by a school board of management provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the schools complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman is that a child has, or may have been negatively affected by the action of a school.</p>  <p>  Queries as to the volume of complaints which have been received by the Ombudsman for Children should be directed to that office, which is contactable at oco@oco.ie or 1800 20 20 40.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that I plan to provide in law for a Parent and Student Charter. Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important. If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision parents are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions.</p>  <p>  This charter may be underpinned by legislation if necessary. I believe there is a need to look at how a stronger culture of valuing parental involvement at the level of each individual school can be created.</p></reply>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.1081" nospeaker="true" ><p>Main Estimate features

D/Education &amp;amp; Science 2010

Capital

- Capital allocation of &euro;715m is being made available in 2010. In addition, &euro;79m in capital savings from 2009 will be carried forward into 2010, bringing total capital funding available for education in 2010 to &euro;794m. 

- The total funding available is a decrease of less than 7pc compared to the allocation for 2009.

- &euro;579m will be allocated to continue the significant investment being made in the school building programme. That includes &euro;72m from the capital carry-over.

- Given the reduction in tender prices, it&rsquo;s expected that the Department will be able to deliver a similar-sized programme of large and small-scale building projects in primary and post-primary schools in 2010 as was delivered in 2009. As well as providing for all contractual commitments on existing projects, the building programme will include a further batch of major new school or extension projects to proceed to tender and construction during 2010. There will also be a Summer Works Scheme incorporating water conservation measures.  

- &euro;141m is being provided for infrastructural investment in higher education of which &euro;46m will be provided for investment under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.

- &euro;50m is being allocated to support the integration of information and communications technology in teaching and learning in schools. That includes &euro;7m from the capital carry-over.

- Provision has also been made in the capital allocation for the continuation of the Department&rsquo;s public-private partnership programme.

Current

- The current allocation for 2010 is &euro;8.168bn which is a reduction of 4.9pc over the 2009 outturn. The reduction includes a general pay-related adjustment of &euro;350m in line with the Government decision to reduce public service pay rates.  This accounts for 4pc of the reduction. The distribution of this pay adjustment across subheads will be included in the context of the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume.

Additional expenditure measures

- &euro;12m is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide 500 extra teachers over the next three years. This allocation will allow for the employment of an extra 200 teachers starting in early 2010 and a further 150 teachers starting in September 2010.

- &euro;14m is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide extra teachers from September 2010 for the 2010/11 school year to meet demographic pressures and to ensure no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio. This allocation will fund 600 posts in primary schools and 330 posts in post-primary schools.

- &euro;19m is being provided to maintain school capitation grants at current levels and to take account of increased pupil numbers. This allocation will also enable extra funding to be allocated to schools for school books and to support curricular activities as provided in the Renewed Programme for Government.

- The allocation for the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is being increased by &euro;7.5m to meet additional expenditure on allowances due to the change in profile of applicants for the scheme.

An extra allocation of &euro;3m is being provided for the promotion of Gaeilge in schools as part of the new 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language.

The provision for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is being increased to provide for the rise in psychologists to 210. This will allow NEPS psychologists to provide direct service to every first and second level school and an enhancement of service to special schools and units.

Higher education

- The provision in 2010 for universities and institutes of technology is &euro;1,194m - a 9pc reduction on the 2009 provision of &euro;1,318m.

- The reduction in funding takes account of the general pay cut, targeted reductions in numbers employed under an employment control framework for the sector. It will also involve further non-pay cost efficiencies.  

- Just under &euro;130m is being provided to higher education institutions in 2010 for research activities including capital research funding. This underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to focussed delivery of its Science, Technology and Innovation strategy. As part of this, it&rsquo;s intended that investments under Cycle 5 of the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions will proceed. The assessment process for PRTLI 5 awards will conclude in early 2010 and, in line with normal lead-in times, major elements of expenditure commitments are anticipated to materialise from 2011 onwards.  

The funding available in 2010 for projects under the Strategic Innovation Fund is &euro;18m - a reduction of &euro;8m on 2009. This reduced allocation will require a further curtailment of project activity. Priority will continue to be given to projects aimed at upskiilling and reskilling for employment.

Student grants and scholarships

A reduction of 5pc is being applied to the rates of student grants and scholarships. This will achieve &euro;10m in savings in 2010. However, the overall allocation for student support will be increased in 2010 to take account of increased numbers of students.

The reduction will be implemented to all existing and new grant-holders from January 2010. This is in line with reductions in other income maintenance payments including those for the unemployed.

A further saving of &euro;4m will be made by the removal of eligibility for student support grants from people in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing a Post-Leaving Certificate course. However, the cost of the student service charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met by the Exchequer on their behalf.  This will apply to all new grant-holders in 2010 onwards.

Support under the Millennium Partnership Fund is being withdrawn saving &euro;2m.

Adult and further education

The number of places provided in Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) will be reduced from 984 places to 684 places. This in line with the Traveller Education Strategy. Travellers can continue to access the full range of adult and further education programmes across the country.  

Allowances to participants in VTOS, Youthreach and STTCs will be reduced in line with the appropriate social welfare rates or F&Aacute;S trainee allowances.

Teacher education

The provision for teacher in-service education support is &euro;29.79m compared with a 2009 estimate of &euro;40m. Restructuring of existing services will continue in 2010. Services will be focused on priority areas including special educational needs, child protection guidelines training, implementation of new procedures for underperforming teachers, and Project Maths.

The allocation for pre-service teacher education is being reduced by &euro;3m and will be achieved by reducing the number of post-graduate conversion places.

Teacher sick leave and substitution

- The supply teacher scheme at primary level will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year. Normal substitution arrangements which apply to primary schools generally to cover teacher absences will be used to cover substitution in those schools that participated in the scheme.

- From the start of the 2010/11 school year, the maximum number of uncertified sick leave days allowed in the school year for teachers in primary, secondary and community and comprehensive schools will be reduced to seven days. This is the same number of days available for teachers in vocational schools and community colleges.

School transport

The provision for school transport is &euro;186m compared with a 2009 out-turn of &euro;178m. While efficiencies made during 2009 will continue to yield savings in 2010, an increase of &euro;8m is being provided which includes provision for new services as necessary.

Reduction in allocations to education bodies

- National Council for Curriculum and Assessment reduced by &euro;0.93m;

- National Council for Special Education reduced by &euro;2.3m;

- Higher Education Authority reduced by &euro;0.562m;

- Dublin Dental Hospital reduced by &euro;0.410m;

- Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies reduced by &euro;0.546m;

- Royal Irish Academy of Music reduced by &euro;0.303m;

- National Qualifications Framework (NQAI, FETAC, HETAC) current allocation reduced by &euro;2.1m;

Other current

Further savings will be made from expenditure efficiencies in the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget (excluding NEPS) achieving &euro;2.4m. 

Procurement savings of &euro;5.2 million

The allocation of &euro;5m funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund will allow for the continuation of existing schemes to counteract educational disadvantage funded from this source.

Funding will be reduced by &euro;1.2m in 2010 for projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas in Dublin city and county. Funding provided by the Department for these projects will be phased out in 2011.</p></speech>

This compares to a 2010 provisional outturn of &euro;8.974 billion, representing a reduction of 1%. In addition the Estimate includes provision for expenditure of some &euro;362 million under the National Training Fund in 2011, which is a reduction of 8% over the 2010 provisional outturn, due mainly to a projected significant reduction in fund income in 2011.</p>  <p>CURRENT EXPENDITURE</p>  <p>- A provision for current expenditure of &euro;8.387 billion has been made for 2011. This is an increase of just over 1% on the equivalent 2010 outturn of allocation of &euro;8.271 billion. A further &euro;362 million of current expenditure is provided for under the National Training Fund.  The 2011 allocation takes account of upward expenditure pressures mainly in relation to student support payments, the cost of pensions and demographic increases. It also takes account of savings of some &euro;175 million to be secured across the education sector. More details regarding current expenditure are provided below.</p>  <p>School Transport</p>  <p>- The 2011 estimate for school transport services is &euro;180 million compared to an allocation for 2010 of &euro;186 million. &euro;4.5 million in savings will be secured in 2011 (rising to &euro;17 million in 2014), through a combination of increases in charges and the implementation of measures identified in a value for money review of the school transport scheme. With effect from the 2011/2012 school year a transport fee of &euro;50 per annum will be introduced for primary school pupils, with a maximum family charge of &euro;110 applying. This charge is being introduced to ensure that school transport provided for eligible primary pupils is fully utilised. The annual charge for post-primary pupils will be increased by &euro;50 from &euro;300 to &euro;350. The combined maximum overall family charge will remain at &euro;650.</p>  <p>- Changes in the 2011/2012 school year arising from the value for money review will include:</p>  <p>- The distance criteria will be applied to all pupils attending primary schools and the exemption under the closed school rule will cease. This means that children who reside less than 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from the school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school under the closed school rule will lose their transport eligibility;</p>  <p>- Services under the minimum numbers, either single services or which are part of double tripping arrangements, will be discontinued. A pick up density of pupils in a distinct locality on a particular route &ndash; increasing from the current minimum of 7 to 10 eligible children &ndash; will be required to establish or retain services.</p>  <p>- Further changes from the review, which will take effect from a later date, will include the following:</p>  <p>- From the 2012/13 school year, eligibility based on the closed school rule (CSR) and the central school rule will cease for all new children entering primary schools. Existing primary pupils availing of transport under the CSR will retain transport eligibility for the duration of their schooling, provided the requisite distance is met;</p>  <p>- From the 2012/13 school year, the use of the catchment boundary system will cease for all new post-primary children. Eligibility for all new children entering post-primary transport will be on the basis of the nearest post-primary centre or school. Existing arrangements will remain in place for existing post primary pupils for the duration of their schooling;</p>  <p>- New arrangements will be put in place with Bus &Eacute;ireann on a phased basis for the operation of the scheme. These will include arrangements for an increasing proportion of routes to be provided by private operators. From the 2012/13 school year, Bus &Eacute;ireann will have full responsibility for the operation of the school transport system including responsibility for processing all applications for school transport or grants.  Synergies between school transport, rural transport and Health Service Executive services will be further developed.</p>  <p>Schools</p>  <p>- &euro;22 million in savings will be secured in 2011 through an average 5% reduction in funding grants to schools and Vocational Educational Committees (including mainstream and ancillary grants for schools), and including grants for Adult Literacy, Community Education, School Completion Programme, Youthreach. This will reduce capitation rates to those that applied to schools between 2007 and 2008. (There will also be a similar reduction in capitation rates payable in respect of Senior Traveller Training Centres, VTOS (Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme) and PLC (Post-Leaving Certificate) students). Details of the revised rates for each grant category will be issued to schools and VECs shortly. Reduced rates will also apply to ancillary and support services grants to reflect the reduction in pay that will apply to personnel who are paid from these grants, and who have not yet had the reduction applied to them, with effect from January 2011, e.g. school cleaners and caretakers.</p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation for teacher salaries of almost &euro;3.85 billion takes account of &euro;24 million in savings (rising to &euro;98 million in 2014) to be achieved by reducing teacher numbers through a combination of measures. These measures will lead to a deferral of 150 extra posts and to a reduction of up to approximately 1,200 posts from September 2011 (approximately 700 primary and 500 post-primary posts) which, however, will be partly offset by the addition of an estimated 875 new posts due to demographics. The measures to reduce teacher posts include:</p>  <p>- Deferral of the provision of 150 extra teachers originally planned to be allocated at primary and post-primary level in September 2011;</p>  <p>- Changing the existing favourable pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) to the standard PTR for the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP). Currently, the allocation of teachers to the LCVP is on the basis of 1 teacher for every 17 pupils. This will be changed from September 2011 to the standard allocation basis of 1 teacher for every 19 pupils (or 1 teacher for every 20 pupils in the case of fee-charging schools). This measure will secure savings of approximately 200 posts; </p>  <p>- Standardising the staffing schedule for Gaelscoileanna to the same that operates for other ordinary national schools, the estimated yield from which will be some 50 posts;</p>  <p>- Withdrawal of Resource Teachers for Travellers posts at primary level so that educational teaching supports to Traveller students will now be provided on the same basis as other students in schools. Alleviation measures will be put in place for schools with a high concentration of Traveller children. At post-primary level teaching hours for Travellers will be withdrawn, again with alleviation measures for schools with high concentrations of Traveller children. This measure will secure savings of approximately 600 posts net.</p>  <p>- A phased reduction of 500 over four years in the number of Language Support Teachers, through a demand driven reduction and, if necessary, a change in allocation rules over the period of the plan. A first year reduction of some 125 posts is targeted with effect from September 2011; </p>  <p>- The redeployment of some 170 existing supernumerary posts in post-primary schools from September 2011;</p>  <p>- The removal of 47 primary rural co-ordinator teaching posts currently allocated to DEIS rural primary schools. All of these schools, however, will continue to receive other DEIS supports including financial support, professional development supports, school meals and school books supports; </p>  <p>- The withdrawal from September 2011 of 42 Visiting Teachers for Travellers posts, currently assigned to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The School Support services, including the School Completion Programme and the Home School Liaison Service under the NEWB, will be adapted to undertake work with Travellers in the future.</p>  <p>- In line with the Traveller Education Strategy and the 2008 value for money review of Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs), integrated further education provision for Travellers will be implemented through the phasing out of STTCs by June 2012 and replacement places, prioritised for Travellers, being provided under the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI).  This means there will be no new enrolments in STTCs from 1 January 2011.</p>  <p>- &euro;10 million in savings will be secured from rule changes and efficiencies in relation to supervision and substitution arrangements in schools. This will include implementation of the flexibility measures provided for under the Croke Park Agreement whereby post-primary teachers will be available for an extra class period each week to cover for absent colleagues. There will also be a general tightening of the rules covering substitution.</p>  <p>Special Needs Assistants</p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation for pay for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) will be approximately &euro;350 million, compared to an allocation of &euro;335 for 2010. The allocation provides for the full-year costs of SNAs appointed in 2010. While there will be no reduction in the SNA numbers in 2011 it is intended to place a cap on these numbers. The Department will in this regard work with the National Council for Special Education to develop a new system to manage SNA provision within the total numbers allocation. All schools will be advised of the new system.</p>  <p>Further and Higher Education</p>  <p>- The 2011 provision for Universities, Institutes of Technology and other higher education institutions is &euro;1.176 billion. Net of adjustments for increased income in respect of the Student Contribution Charge of &euro;2,000, the overall 2011 Allocation includes &euro;55.8m in respect of Nurses Education transferred from D/Health and also includes a further 1.5% cut in the pay allocation and 5% in the non-payallocation.</p>  <p>- Further savings of &euro;27 million will be achieved by replacing the existing &euro;1,500 per year Student Services Charge with a flat higher education Student Contribution of &euro;2,000 with effect from the 2011/2012 academic year.  The Student Contribution will apply to all students who currently benefit under the &lsquo;free fees&rsquo; scheme.  Higher education institutions will be asked to consider how they could put in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the charge in two equal instalments of 50% in September and 50% in January in a given academic year.  The contribution will be paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the third level grant schemes.  These students, who account for some 43% of all undergraduates, will not be impacted by any increase in charges.  The Government is also aware of the particular financial pressures that this charge may place on families where family income is marginally in excess of current eligibility levels for maintenance grant support and on families with more than one sibling in higher education at the same time.  With this in mind, the current higher education grants schemes threshold will be increased to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for &lsquo;50% Student Contribution&rsquo; (see detail in Appendix). In addition, arrangements will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new &euro;2,000 charge.</p>  <p>- The introduction of a new &euro;200 annual contribution for Post Leaving Certificate students will secure savings of &euro;4 million in 2011. The cost of the charge will be met by the Exchequer on behalf of those students who are eligible under the maintenance grant scheme for students attending PLC courses. Eligible students may include those in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance provided that they meet all of the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme.</p>  <p>- Provision of further education opportunities in 2011 will be largely the same as that in 2010, with over 173,000 participants benefiting from VEC interventions. </p>  <p>Student Support</p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation for student support payments is &euro;386 million. This represents an increase of some 7% over 2010 and reflects both increased numbers of students qualifying for grants and a greater proportion of students qualifying for higher rates of grants, which are means tested.</p>  <p>- The current higher education grants schemes threshold will be increased to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for &lsquo;50% Student Contribution&rsquo; (see Appendix).</p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation also takes account of savings of some &euro;22 million (rising to some &euro;51 million in 2014), to be achieved through implementing a range of savings measures in the student support scheme. These measures include:</p>  <p>- A 4% reduction in the rate of student support grants, reflecting the reductions in rates of social protection payments announced in the Budget. This will yield savings of &euro;8 million;</p>  <p>- Changing the qualifying distance criterion for entitlement to the higher non-adjacent rate of grant (distance from home to the higher education institution) from 15 miles (24 kilometres) to 28 miles (45 kilometres).  The original distance criterion was set in 1968, before the significant improvement in transport facilities and road networks which has taken place. This measure will yield &euro;10 million of savings in 2011 (&euro;30 million in 2014);</p>  <p>- Savings of &euro;4 million (&euro;13 million in 2014) will be secured by reducing the automatic eligibility of mature students to the higher non-adjacent rate of payment, thereby bringing the arrangements for mature students into line with all other students.</p>  <p>Skills and Training</p>  <p>- Savings of approximately &euro;10 million will be achieved in the area of training allowances and supports.  This includes a reduction, consistent with reductions in social protection rates announced in the Budget, of &euro;8 per week in all weekly training allowances and similar support payments. The long-term unemployment bonus paid to VTOS (Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme) students and to FAS trainees will be reduced from &euro;31.80 per week to &euro;20 per week.</p>  <p>- The allocation for Skills and Training includes provision for a number of measures to strengthen the framework of labour market activation supports for the unemployed, as part of the National Recovery Plan. These will include the introduction in 2011 of a Skills Development and Internship Programme and an expansion of the number of placements available on the Work Placement Programme. While provision for training and activation for the unemployed will have to have regard to the reduced availability of funding, the above measures will seek to enhance the quality of offering for unemployed persons. All further education programmes will also continue to be open to the unemployed and unemployed people undertaking these programmes may be eligible to participate in the Back to Education Allowance Scheme. The Labour Market Activation Fund will be targeted at specific priority groups among the unemployed, including the low skilled and those formerly employed in declining sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35s and the long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>- In Budget 2011 the allocation to F&Aacute;S for training the unemployed was decreased by &euro;43 million or approximately 15%. This will result in an equivalent reduction of 15,410 training places that F&Aacute;S can deliver for the unemployed next year. This will imply that FAS will deliver approximately 100,000 training places next year as opposed to the 115,000 they are delivering this year. </p>  <p>Other current expenditure items</p>  <p>- The reduced 2011 allocation of &euro;18.6 million for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) takes account of &euro;3 million in savings to be secured through capping at 178 the number of psychologists in the service;</p>  <p>- A saving of &euro;1 million in 2011, rising to &euro;12 million in 2014, will be achieved through the impact of a 10% reduction in salary scales for new entrants to the public service, with all new entrants starting on the minimum point of the new scale.</p>  <p>- &euro;16 million in savings (&euro;39 million in 2014) will be achieved through further reductions in public service numbers on the Education and Skills Vote, including in the Non-Commercial State Agencies under the aegis of the Department. These reductions are on foot of the updated Employment Control Framework in the National Recovery Plan, to control public sector numbers.</p>  <p>- A further &euro;18 million in savings will be achieved through a range of non-pay administrative savings, the management of emerging expenditure pressures and other estimating savings.</p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation of &euro;77 million for the Administrative Budget subheads A1 to A8 includes an additional &euro;1.6 million in staff costs as a result of the transfer of functions in May 2010. When account is taken of this the 2011 allocation for these subheads represents a reduction of 2% on 2010. </p>  <p>- The 2011 allocations to a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department reflect reductions in payroll and other administrative savings.</p>  <p>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE</p>  <p>- The capital allocation for 2011 will be &euro;501 million. The figure reflects the overall medium-term reduction in capital investment announced in the National Recovery Plan.</p>  <p>- The capital expenditure envelope for education of almost &euro;1.9 billion over the period of the plan will provide for meeting demographic needs in primary and post-primary schools and for some improvement in the stock of school buildings. The allocation will also provide for some prioritised investment in third-level infrastructure.</p>  <p>- The capital allocation for 2011 for Schools Information and Communications Technology of &euro;1.5 million is significantly lower than the 2010 allocation of &euro;63 million, which includes an allocation of &euro;20 million recently provided by way of Supplementary Estimate. This reflects the very significant capital investment in Schools ICT in 2009 and 2010 as part of the &lsquo;smart schools&rsquo; programme.  The focus in 2011 will be on leveraging this significant investment to ensure further integration of ICT into teaching and learning.</p></speech>

This fund, which will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed, will deliver upward of 6,500 places in 2012.    </p>  <p>- &euro;10 million is being allocated, also under the National Training Fund, to support a further roll-out of the Springboard initiative to increase the part time higher education opportunities for unemployed people. A new competitive tendering process for Springboard will take place in the first quarter of 2012.</p>  <p>Special Needs Education</p>  <p>- The overall number of resource teachers and SNAs provided for children with special education needs is being maintained.  Allocations will continue to be managed within existing resources.</p>  <p>DEIS (disadvantage school scheme)</p>  <p>- While DEIS schools are not immune to budgetary measures, a key priority is to target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>- At primary level, a new staffing schedule for all 199 DEIS Band 1 schools will be based on a general average of 1 teacher for every 22 pupils.  This will replace the existing approach of giving a &ldquo;top up&rdquo; allocation on the existing standard staffing schedule to enable DEIS Band 1 schools to implement reduced class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes.  </p>  <p>- While the new staffing schedule gives greater autonomy to DEIS Band 1 schools, the schools should continue to prioritise their staffing allocation to implement more favourable pupil teacher ratios in junior classes, in line with DEIS policy.  </p>  <p>- All DEIS second level schools will be given targeted support through a more favourable staffing PTR of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second level schools.  195 second level schools are included in DEIS.</p>  <p>- The creation of the two dedicated DEIS staffing schedules at primary and second level will be accompanied by a phased withdrawal of 428 legacy posts.  These posts were allocated to some schools under previous disadvantage programmes prior to the DEIS initiative of 2005.  To help those schools considered to be particularly adversely affected by this decision the posts will be gradually withdrawn over a three year period starting in 2012/13 school year.  The new DEIS Band 1 staffing schedule and reduced PTR for second level DEIS schools will apply immediately to these schools from September 2012. </p>  <p>- 20 of these 428 posts being withdrawn will be re-allocated for the purposes of providing the continuous professional development element of the Department&rsquo;s Literacy and Numeracy strategy which also has a focus on tackling educational disadvantage and is a key commitment in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>- The five existing scholarship schemes for higher education are being replaced with a single bursary style, merit based scheme with awards set at &euro;2,000 per student.   The bursary will be an additional support to incentivise and reward high achievement for students from DEIS schools.  Students who are awarded the bursary will also be eligible to apply for higher education grants.   Allocation in 2012 &euro;130,000 rising to an estimated &euro;750,000 in 2015.</p>  <p>Posts of Responsibility in second level schools</p>  <p>- Provision is being made within the overall pay budget to allow for further alleviation measures in relation to the filling of additional Assistant Principal posts  in second level schools. This measure is intended to ensure, as far as possible in 2012/13, that second level schools will be able to maintain approximately 50% of the number of Assistant Principal posts they held prior to the introduction of the moratorium.</p>  <p>Teacher Allocations</p>  <p>- There will be no increase in the general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level for the 2012/13 school year.  </p>  <p>- Starting in 2012, phased adjustments will be made to the staffing schedules for 1, 2, 3 and 4 teacher primary schools (schools with less than 86 pupils).  These adjustments will increase the minimum number of pupils required for allocation of teaching posts.  The phasing of these measures provides the schools concerned with time to consider their future and the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  This change will yield an estimated 250 posts (100 posts in 2012).  Saving in 2012 &euro;1.5 million. Full year saving &euro;15 million.  </p>  <p>- At second level, with effect from 2012/13 school year guidance provision will be managed by schools from within their standard teacher allocation. At present a separate allocation is made for guidance.  This measure is an alternative to making a change to the overall staffing schedule.   This approach means that schools have greater autonomy and have the flexibility to decide the precise resources they wish to allocate for guidance balanced against the other demands on available staff resources.   The change is estimated to yield net savings of 500 posts when provision is made for the reduced staffing schedule for DEIS schools. Saving in 2012 &euro;10.4 million. Full year saving &euro;32 million.</p>  <p>- In addition to the new arrangements for guidance posts there will also be a 1 point increase in the staffing schedule for all fee-charging schools. These changes will increase the PTR for fee-paying schools to 21:1 with effect from the 2012/13 school year.  In order to inform future policy on the potential extent and nature of Exchequer investment, including funding for teacher posts, in the fee-charging sector in subsequent years the Department will conduct a specific analysis on tuition fee income available to schools in the sector and its utilisation. The 1-point increase in the staffing schedule is estimated to yield savings of 50 posts. Saving in 2012 &euro;1 million.   Full year saving &euro;3.2 million.  </p>  <p>- Budget 2010 contained a provision to reduce language support posts over a 4 year period from an original level of about 1,400 posts to a reduced level of about 900 posts in 2014/15 school year. The current level of language support posts is about 1,120 posts. The remaining reduction of about 220 posts will be implemented in the 2013/14 and 2014/15 school years.  Most of this reduction will be at primary level as this is the sector where most are currently allocated.</p>  <p>- Some limited alleviation arrangements will be put in place by the Department for those primary and post-primary schools that are most adversely affected by the staffing changes announced today. The details will be notified to schools in early January.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.1086" nospeaker="true" ><p>When account is taken of additional posts for demographics at primary and second level the net overall reduction on teaching posts for the 2012/13 school year compared to the current school year is estimated to be of the order of 200 posts. This represents an estimated net reduction of about 0.3% on overall teacher numbers for the 2012/13 school year compared to the current 2011/12 school year.  

- The budget measures announced today include target savings of a further 520 teaching posts (490 posts at primary level and 30 posts at second level) that come into effect from the 2013/14 school year onwards.  

- At this stage the target savings are calculated based on estimates.  The actual position will become clearer as the allocation process is progressed and the impact of demographics for each school is known.  

- The reductions in teacher numbers are predicated on effective redeployment arrangements.  It remains the case that a situation where surplus teachers could remain in schools is not sustainable.

Reform of the teacher allocation process

- In addition to the savings measures, reforms to the existing teacher allocations process will come into effect from the 2012/13 school year onwards.  The primary objectives of the reforms are to increase school autonomy and to help the teacher allocation process to operate more smoothly within a climate of fixed ceilings on teaching posts. The changes are designed to give a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools, give earlier certainty to schools about their staffing allocations and, where possible, simplify existing processes and give schools greater discretion on how posts are used.

Review of Teacher Allowances

- Pending completion of the public service-wide review of allowances and given the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances, the Government has decided to make changes, with immediate effect, to the rules governing payment of qualification allowances to teachers.

- Any teacher being employed for the first time in a recognised school will not be able to obtain an allowance at a level greater than that applying to those who hold an honours degree. This means that qualifications at Masters or Doctorate level will not be paid and those who hold a H.Dip will not be permitted through any combination of allowances to exceed the level of allowance payable in respect of an Honours Degree.

- This measure does not affect allowances being paid at present to existing teachers.  However those teachers will not be paid any additional allowance if they acquire any further qualification. Allowances paid for qualifications that relate to specific posts will continue to be paid but will be subject to examination in the review.

Funding for Schools / School Programmes

- Overall there will be a 2% reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools in each of 2012 and 2013 and a further 1% reduction in each of 2014 and 2015.  Saving in 2012 &euro;7 million. Full year saving &euro;20.6 million.

- The reduction will be made through changes to the basic capitation rates.  The new basic rate for primary schools will be &euro;183. This is above the rate of &euro;178.58 that applied in the 2007/2008 school year. For secondary schools the new rate will be &euro;317 which is the rate that applied from 1 January 2007 with a pro rata reduction in the funding allocation to Community and Comprehensive schools and VEC schools.

- In order to inform future policy In relation to the equalisation of funding between voluntary secondary schools and other schools the Minister has asked his officials to update the data on the funding differences in each sector.

- The basic capitation reduction will apply to all schools but all DEIS schools will continue to receive the enhanced DEIS grant payment which is not being reduced.

- Other grants paid to schools including ancillary and support services funding and book grants will remain at current rates. 

- The Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative, which has operated on a pilot basis since 1998, will be abolished.  This is a long-running pilot scheme involving approximately 500 schools. Saving in 2012/13 &euro;2.5 million. Full Year saving &euro;2.5 million. Savings will go towards the cost of implementing the Literacy &amp;amp; Numeracy Strategy.

- The administration fee paid to schools for the supervision/substitution scheme will be reduced from 5% to 2%.Saving in 2012 &euro;1.5 million. Full year saving &euro;1.5 million.

- Changes will be announced in early 2012 to the operation of the school book grant in order to incentivise the establishment of book rental schemes in schools. This forms part of the Minister&rsquo;s ongoing initiative to reduce school related costs for parents.

Higher Education

- The student contribution will increase by &euro;250 for the academic year 2012/13.All students who are eligible for means tested student support will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf in addition to receiving any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant they are entitled to.  Around 41% of students are currently in receipt of maintenance grants and do not pay the student contribution.The allocation for higher education institutions will be adjusted down to take account of the additional revenue from the increase in the student contribution.

- There will be a 2% reduction in core pay funding for higher education institutions in 2012, a further 2% reduction in 2013, a further 1% reduction in each 2014 and 2015.  Total cumulative reduction of 6%.  Saving in 2012 &euro;17 million. Full year saving &euro;50 million.

- There will be a 2% reduction in core non-pay funding for higher education institutions in 2012, a further 2% reduction in 2013, a further 1% reduction in each 2014 and 2015.  Total cumulative reduction of 6%. Saving in 2012 &euro;6.6 million. Full year saving &euro;19 million.

- The Technological Sector research programme will be wound down. This programme funded master&rsquo;s scholarships and project based research in the IoT sector. No new awards have been made since 2008.All existing commitments will have been met by 2012.Saving in 2012 &euro;1 million. Full year saving &euro;1 million.

Student grants and scholarships

- There will be changes to the fee and maintenance grants system for post-graduate studies for new entrants which currently benefits over 9,000 students. No maintenance grants will be paid for new entrants from the 2012/13 academic year.  Fees will continue to be paid for those students that would previously have qualified for the special rate of grant. Over 2,000 students currently qualify for the special rate of grant.In addition, based on their means, a further 4,000 post graduate students will be awarded a &euro;2,000 fee contribution grant. This will apply to new entrants from 2012/2013 academic year. Saving in 2012 &euro;6 million. Full year saving &euro;54.2 million.

- A reduction of 3% is being applied to the rates for student maintenance grants. The reduction will be implemented for all existing and new grant holders from January 2012. Saving in 2012 &euro;6.6 million. Full year saving &euro;6.6 million.

- The means test for student maintenance grants will be amended to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income.  This will be introduced in the 2013/14 academic year for new entrants. Estimated saving in first year &euro;1.5 million. Full year estimated saving &euro;14 million. 

- The allocation for the Fund for Students with Disabilities will be reduced by 20% to reflect the reduced drawdown from the fund.  Saving in 2012 &euro;2.8 million. Full year saving &euro;2.8 million.

Further Education and Training

- Savings will be achieved in the provision of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for teachers.Saving in 2012 &euro;3 million.Full year saving &euro;3 million. The savings will be used to offset the cost of providing CPD associated with implementing the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.

School transport

- The charge for primary school transport will increase from &euro;50 to &euro;100. The family maximum at primary level will increase to &euro;220 from &euro;110.These measures will be offset by a reduction in concessionary charges at primary level with the charge reducing from &euro;200 to &euro;100.  The overall family maximum charge of &euro;650 remains unchanged as does the post primary charge of &euro;350.  Saving in 2012 &euro;0.4 million. Full Year saving &euro;1 million.

Budget Measures

The measures listed below will secure net savings in 2013 of &euro;90 million, rising to &euro;103 million in 2014 and &euro;123 million in a full year. When account is taken of these measures the Department of Education and Skills will require further savings of some &euro;44 million in 2014 in order to live within the expenditure ceiling set for that year.

Primary &amp;amp; Second Level staffing:

At primary level the staffing schedule has been protected at 28:1.

Similarly, at second level the staffing arrangements in all free schools have been maintained.  In DEIS schools this figure is 18.25:1 and in mainstream schools it is 19:1.

Fee-charging schools

At a time of severely reduced resources, priorities have to be made.  In an effort to ensure fairness in the education system, the PTR in fee charging schools will rise by two points to 23:1 in September 2013.

A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools will be published in the New Year.  This report is expected to show that fee charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding.

DEIS schools

Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) schools have been protected in this Budget.  There have been no changes to overall teacher numbers or funding for DEIS schools as a result of this Budget.

Special Education 

Similarly, the number of Resource Teachers (9,950) has been maintained as has the number of SNAs (10,575).  A total of approximately &euro;1.3 billion will be spent on special education in 2013 &ndash; the same as in 2012.

Reducing the Cost of substitution for teachers &amp;amp; SNAs

Sick Leave:

Civil servants are required to be referred to the occupational health service after four weeks of sick leave.  Up until now, schools have not been required to refer teachers and SNAs until 12 weeks and 8 weeks of sick leave respectively.  These sick leave arrangements will be made similar to those operating in the civil service and are estimated to save &euro;4 million per annum in substitution costs.

Maternity and Adoptive Leave in Lieu: 

Currently teachers and SNAs on maternity leave are entitled to an additional maximum of 30 paid absence days, in lieu of days during their period of maternity leave when the schools were closed. This benefit was introduced at a time when paid maternity leave stood at 14 weeks, rather than the 26 weeks that currently operates and was to compensate for school closures which occurred during the maternity leave period. The cost of covering the substitution for these absences in 2011/12 was approximately &euro;20 million.  This arrangement, which is not available to other public servants or private sector workers, is to be ended. This will not affect a teacher&rsquo;s or SNA&rsquo;s entitlements to 26 weeks&rsquo; paid leave and an optional 16 weeks&rsquo; unpaid maternity leave. A similar change will be made in respect of adoptive leave in lieu. The new measure will be introduced on May 1st 2013 in order to give some advance notice.  It will result in savings of &euro;11 million in 2013 and &euro;20 million in a full year.

FURTHER EDUCATION 

PLC Pupil Teacher Ratio

The PTR for Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programmes will be harmonised with mainstream second level schools, from 17:1 to 19:1.  This will result in a reduction of 200 PLC teaching posts and a saving of &euro;4 million in 2013 rising to &euro;12 million in a full year.  However, there should be no adverse impact on the number of PLC places available.

Reduce supports to Further Education &amp;amp; Training (FET) scheme participants

Currently, jobseekers who enrol in VTOS, Youthreach and FAS training schemes can have their Jobseeker payments (personal rate) increased to the maximum &euro;188 per week, in cases where their jobseeker payment is less than this.  This arrangement will be discontinued in January, with jobseekers who move on to these schemes remaining on their existing rate of payment. However, people under 25 will continue to have their payment increased up to a maximum of &euro;160.  This decision has been taken as it is no longer considered necessary to provide a financial incentive to people to take up FET places.  The measure will apply to new entrants and will save &euro;10.5 million in 2013 and &euro;21 million in a full year.  The measure is being replicated by the Department of Social Protection in relation to the Back to Education Allowance scheme.

Reduce allocations to VECs in 2013

The 2013 allocation to the VECs will be reduced by &euro;13.2 million. Notwithstanding the reduction, there will be no reduction in the level of services provided in 2013.  However, VECs will be required to manage within their existing cash reserves on hand.

TARGETED SKILLS PROVISION 

In 2013, the National Training Fund expenditure will see provision of: 

- &euro;20 million for a further call under the Labour Market Education and Training Fund, which will be targeted at the long-term unemployed and will deliver some 6,500 places in 2013;

- &euro;23 million in respect of the Springboard initiative  to increase the part time higher education opportunities for unemployed people; and

- &euro;5 million for a second phase of ICT Skills Conversion courses. These were introduced earlier in 2012 as part of the joint industry-Government ICT Action Plan aimed at building the supply of high-level ICT graduates.

HIGHER EDUCATION 

Student contribution 

As already signalled, the student contribution will rise by &euro;250 in 2013, 2014 &amp;amp; 2015 to a maximum of &euro;3,000.  This will raise &euro;18.5 million next year and &euro;37 million in 2014.  All students who are eligible for student grants will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf. At present two out of five students are in receipt of some form of student grant.  The rates of maintenance grants are being protected in this Budget.

There will be a 3% reduction in the income thresholds used when calculating entitlement to student grants in 2013.  Between 1997 and 2009, the income limits were increased by an average of 4.7% each year, in line with average industrial earnings.  However, the income limits over the past three years have remained unchanged, despite an estimated drop in the average industrial wage of approximately 7.9%.  The 3% reduction will be applied to the income thresholds for all students from September 2013 for the 2013/2014 academic year.  It will see the threshold for the maximum standard rate of grant reduce from &euro;41,110 to &euro;39,875 and save &euro;2 million in 2013, rising to &euro;5 million in a full year. Approximately 8% of the total estimated 80,000 grant recipients will be affected by the measure.

Reduce allocation to higher education institutions (HEIs) in 2013

Similar to the measure applying to the VEC sector, next year the allocation to the HEIs will be reduced by &euro;25 million.  However, the institutions will be expected to deliver the same level of student services and manage this reduction through the use of existing cash reserves held by them.

Resourcing special projects

The Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, a key priority of the Government, continues to be rolled out and will cost approximately &euro;6.5 million in 2013.

The New Junior Cycle Framework, announced earlier this year, will be funded to the tune of &euro;3 million in 2013.

The roll-out of high speed broadband continues, with a further 200 schools expected to be connected by September 2013.  All second-level schools will receive high-speed broadband at no cost to themselves by Sept 2014.  

The Schools Building programme for 2013 will see work begin on 50 projects for new schools and major extensions.  This will bring the number of planned major school projects on site in 2013 to 113 as part of an overall capital expenditure on schools of almost &euro;370 million. 

Previous Budget Measures impacting in 2013 

Certain teacher allocation measures introduced in earlier Budgets will also impact on teacher numbers in 2013. These include the changes in Budget 2012 announced to the staffing schedules for smaller primary schools with up to 4 teachers. This change will have a target yield of some 75 posts in 2013. A further 125 posts will be yielded on foot of the Budget 2011 decision to reduce language support posts over a 4-year period.</p></speech>

When account is taken of additional posts for demographics at primary and second level (extra approximately 20,000 pupils) the net overall increase in teaching posts for the 2013/14 school year compared to the current school year is estimated to be of the order of 900 posts, as shown in the above table. This represents an estimated net increase of about 1.4% on overall teacher numbers for the 2013/14 school year compared to the current 2012/13 school year.

Capitation grants

As a result of school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, funding for capitation and related grants to schools in 2013 will be reduced by 0.5% for primary schools and by 2% for post-primary schools (in 2012 capitation payments were reduced for primary schools by 3.5% and by 2% for post-primary schools). The overall saving will be achieved by a reduction in the standard capitation rates only, and other related grant rates will remain unchanged. The new standard capitation rates will be &euro;176 for primary and &euro;306 for post-primary.

Capitation rates in VTOS and PLC colleges are also being reduced by 2%, while HEIs will see reductions in core-pay and non pay funding of 2%.

Performance Budgeting &ndash; New Estimates Format 

The Department&rsquo;s 2013 Estimate will reflect the new Performance Budgeting format that has been introduced for Government Departments. The change to the Performance Budgeting format is an important element of the Public Sector reform process and seeks to strengthen the focus that the annual Estimates will have on actual outputs and outcomes that Departments will deliver with public funds, based on the objectives and goals contained in the Departments&rsquo; Statement of Strategy. In addition to the high level expenditure information for the Education and Skills Vote published with today&rsquo;s Budget, more detailed information regarding the 2013 Estimate is being published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.1089" nospeaker="true" ><p>2014 MAIN ESTIMATES FEATURES

SCHOOLS

DEIS schools

Schools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) (DEIS) are protected in this Budget.  There have been no changes to DEIS Programme teacher allocation ratios or DEIS grants to schools as a result of this Budget.  

Special Education 

Priority will continue to be accorded to special education. Funding for such provision of some &euro;1.3 billion is being maintained in 2014. This includes a further &euro;33 million to fund the education of children with special education needs in schools. The allocation for special needs represents in excess of 15% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training.

Book Rental Schemes

The expenditure allocation will provide &euro;5 million to fund an overall 3 year investment of &euro;15 million to support the further extension of book rental schemes to cover all primary schools.  &euro;9 million of funding is being provided to support rollout in 2014 of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, while &euro;4.8 million will be provided for Junior Cycle reform. All second level schools will have high-speed broadband connectivity before the end of 2014. 

BUDGET MEASURES

The measures listed below will secure net current expenditure savings in 2014 of &euro;33 million. A further &euro;11 million will be secured by way of estimating savings across the Education and Skills Vote.

HIGHER EDUCATION 

Reduce allocation to higher education institutions (HEIs) in 2013

In Budget 2013 the funding allocation to the HEIs was reduced by &euro;25 million, with the institutions expected to manage this reduction and deliver the same level of student services through the use of existing cash reserves held by them. As a result of Budget 2014 this reduction of &euro;25 million will be continued for a further year, again taking account of the cash balances held by HEIs.

FURTHER EDUCATION &amp;amp; TRAINING

Ending concurrent payments to recipients of certain social protection payments who take up FAS and Youthreach courses.

In some instances participants on FAS training courses can retain social protection payments paid by the Department of Social Protection, as well as receiving their &euro;188 FAS and Youthreach training allowance. These concurrent payments, which are not payable to participants in Community Employment or VTOS schemes, are now being ended for new entrants to FAS and Youthreach training courses. This measure will yield &euro;5 million in savings in 2014.

Abolition of &euro;20 long-term unemployment bonus paid to FAS, VTOS and Youthreach participants.

The payment of this allowance goes back to a time of full employment when there was a concern to incentivise the long-term unemployed to engage with labour market activation efforts. This payment will end for new entrants and will save &euro;2.1 million in 2014 and &euro;6.7 million in a full year. However, course participants will continue to receive meal and travel allowances.

FAS apprentices to pay a pro-rata Student Contribution proportionate to the time they spend in Institutes of Technology

Apprentices attend IOTs for two ten-week periods during their four-year apprenticeships. The pro-rata student contribution (currently &euro;540) in respect of each period spent in the IOTs, paid up to now by the Exchequer, will from 2014 be paid by the apprentices themselves, yielding an annual Exchequer saving of &euro;1.6 million.

Alignment of certain Further Education and Training Allowances

Changes being introduced by the Department of Social Protection mean that new claimants of Jobseekers Allowance aged 25 years will from 2014 receive a reduced maximum payment of &euro;144 per week, increased to &euro;160 where a person participates in certain education and training programmes. To align social protection payments with payments made to participants in further education and training, such persons who enrol in VTOS, Youthreach and FAS training schemes will from 2014 also receive this &euro;160 rate.

TEACHER NUMBERS

Provision is made in the 2014 estimates for increases in teacher numbers due to demographics, as well as for increases in resource teacher numbers to maintain individual resource teacher allocations at existing levels. The table below shows the projected impact next year of these increases in numbers, net of reductions for the application of earlier budget measures. The net overall increase in teaching posts for the 2014/15 school year compared to the current school year is estimated to be of the order of 1,395 posts, as shown in the above table. This represents an estimated net increase of about 2.2% on overall teacher numbers for the 2014/15 school year compared to the current 2013/14 school year.</p></speech>

The allocation for 2014 also takes account of savings deriving from savings measures announced in previous Budgets. These measures are summarised below.

Teachers

Teacher allocation measures introduced in earlier Budgets will also impact on teacher numbers in schools in 2014. These include the changes in Budget 2012 announced to the staffing schedules for smaller primary schools with up to 4 teachers. This change will have a target yield of approximately 75 posts in 2014. A further 80 primary posts will be yielded on foot of the Budget 2011 decision to reduce language support posts over a 4-year period.

Student contribution 

As signalled in Budget 2013 the student contribution, at &euro;2,500 for the 2013/14 academic year will rise by a further &euro;250 in each of the 2014/15 and 2015/16 academic years, to a maximum of &euro;3,000.  This will raise &euro;18.5 million next year and &euro;37 million in 2015.  All students who are eligible for student grants will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf. At present two out of five students are in receipt of some form of student grant.  The rates of maintenance grants are being protected in this Budget.

Capitation grants

On foot of school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, funding for capitation and related grants to primary and post-primary schools in 2014 will be reduced by 1%. The overall saving will be achieved by a reduction in the standard capitation rates, with other related grant rates remaining unchanged. The new standard mainstream capitation rates in 2014 will be &euro;173 for primary and &euro;301 for post-primary.

Capitation rates in Youthreach, VTOS and PLC colleges are also being reduced by 1%, while higher education institutions will see reductions in core-pay and non pay funding of 1%.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION

The capital allocation of &euro;546 million will be principally deployed in the ongoing delivery of the Department&rsquo;s five year school building programme (2012 to 2016), which involves 275 major school building projects and an additional 80,000 school places to meet demographic demands.  The 2014 allocation also includes an additional &euro;65 million to meet the costs of projects announced under Government&rsquo;s stimulus initiatives of July 2012 and June 2013, including upfront enabling works for the development of the new DIT campus at Grangegorman and 28 additional school building projects.</p></speech>

Funding for special education provision in 2015 will amount to some &euro;1.37bn billion, which is equivalent to 17.3% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training.

HIGHER EDUCATION 

The reduction in the funding allocation to Higher Education Institutions of &euro;25 million, implemented in Budgets 2013 and 2014, will be restored in 2015.  

FURTHER EDUCATION &amp;amp; TRAINING

The allocation for further education and training, through both Voted expenditure and the National Training Fund, will enable the provision of approximately 270,000 further education and training places to be maintained. 

STUDENT SUPPORT

Students who are entitled to maintenance grants under the student grant scheme will from 2015/16 receive four months of maintenance payments before the end of December and five months payments in the following year. This is a change to the current arrangement whereby three months payments are made before end December and six months payments are made the following year, and takes account of requests to alleviate financial difficulties being experienced by students due to the fact that the academic year now starts earlier in many higher education institutions.

Payments to the Higher Education Institutions in respect of the student contribution for those students receiving student grants will be paid in two instalments, in December 2015 and January 2016, rather than in a single instalment.  

PREVIOUS BUDGET MEASURES IMPACTING IN 2015

The allocation for 2015 also takes account of savings deriving from measures announced in previous Budgets which will be implemented in 2015. These measures are summarised below.

Student contribution in higher education

A final &euro;250 increase in the student contribution, arising from a decision in Budget 2013, will bring the amount of the contribution to &euro;3,000 for the 2015/16 academic year.  This measure will secure net savings of &euro;17 million in 2016.  All students eligible for student grants will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf. Currently over 50% of under-graduates are in receipt of some form of student grant.  The rates of maintenance grants are being protected in this Budget.

Capitation grants

A final 1% reduction in capitation and related grants to primary and post-primary schools, under a measure announced in Budget 2012, will take place in 2015 and will yield savings of approximately &euro;3 million, achieved by a reduction in the standard capitation rates, with other related grant rates remaining unchanged. The new standard mainstream capitation rates in 2015 will be &euro;170 (from &euro;173) for primary and &euro;296 (from &euro;301) for post-primary.  This reduction, however, will be offset by an additional allocation of approximately &euro;5 million to provide for increased pupil numbers in schools.

Capitation rates in Youthreach, VTOS and PLC colleges are also being reduced by a final 1% in 2015 (yield &euro;1 million), while core pay and non-pay funding grants to higher education institutions will also be reduced by a final 1%, yielding &euro;11 million.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION

The capital allocation of &euro;530 million will be principally deployed on the school sector (&euro;450m), Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects (&euro;18m) and on Higher Education projects (&euro;55m).

The focus in the school sector continues to be the provision of additional permanent places to meet the demographic need at both primary and post-primary levels.  Later this year the 2015 Large Scale Projects Programme will be announced and these projects will be primed to advance to tender and construction throughout 2015. The announcement will also include details of the projects on the 2013 and 2014 programmes that are on site. It is expected that over 50 large scale projects will reach substantial completion in 2015.

School places are not only delivered by the completion of Large Scale School Projects but also under the devolved Additional Accommodation Scheme. Other expenditure items in 2015 will include acquiring sites for school buildings, the emergency works scheme, the 2014 Summer Works Scheme, funding furniture and equipment requests and other smaller commitments.

Most of the PPP allocation is in respect of Unitary Charges associated with Bundle 3 Schools.

Expenditure on the Higher Education sector will feature the completion of the St Patrick&rsquo;s Teacher Training College, Drumcondra and on-going development works at DIT Grangegorman as well as the commencement of the Human Biology Building at NUI Galway, an extension to the library at Limerick University, construction of the Confucius Institute at UCD and an infrastructure fund for the institute of technology sector.</p></speech>

The current split for 2014/15, based on the latest data for awardees processed through SUSI, is 57% (non-adjacent) and 43% (adjacent).</p>  <p>  A range of budget measures have been introduced since Budget 2011, as such it is difficult to precisely attribute year-on-year savings to any one particular measure.

The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority as part of the annual budget process and its determination is a reserved function.</p><p>The Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes.  Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>I would consider carefully any application received for a rate waiver scheme.  In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs.  As such, it would be necessary to consider State Aid rules in relation to the provision of any such relief.  In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the businesses that are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates.  This could impose an additional burden on such ratepayers.</p><p>Recent developments have seen some local authorities introduce locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property.  Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.  Unlike rates waiver schemes under section 2 of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020,</i>published in November 2014, sets ambitious targets for supply and reform of the sector.  Given the scale of the challenge in the Dublin area, a key early action of the Strategy was the establishment of a Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce (DSHDT), to oversee and drive the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation across the four Dublin local authorities.  The Strategy is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  An important early action for the DSHDT under the Strategy is Action 4 which involves the agreement of targets for the delivery of social housing units in the four Dublin local authority areas for 2015, and in subsequent years.

The first report of the Task Force was finalised in June 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at thefollowing link: <i>.</i></p><p>In that report, it was indicated inter alia, that:</p><p>1) Across the four Dublin authorities, planning permission is in place for the immediate development of 12,785 houses and 7,925 apartments (includes 8,225 houses and 2,063 apartments in the case of Fingal County Council),which permissions are unconstrained from any short term infrastructure issues and which level of development would broadly equate to at least 3 years supply of new homes if they were being built at a rate of 7,500 homes per annum, for Dublin.</p><p>2) A further 25,507 new homes are deemed permissible in the immediate to short term on lands zoned and available for development but currently without the benefit of a planning permission.</p><p>3) Together, the extent of permitted development and lands available for development are sufficient to meet Dublin&rsquo;s needs for at least the next 6 years, which suggests that wider economic conditions and structural and financial issues within the housing and development sector are more significant constraints on an uplift in activity than the availability of lands or planning permission.<i></i></p><p>The Task Force&rsquo;s<i></i>Second Report on Critical Infrastructure Deficits in Residential Priority Areas in the Dublin Region has been submitted to my Department and I will give due consideration to its<i></i>conclusions<i></i>in consultation with my Government colleagues.</p></reply>

My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which involves taking the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment, in particular without risk to water. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for the investigation of catchment-based water quality issues in this area lies with the local authorities and the responsibility for ensuring safe drinking water lies with Irish Water: both are supervised in these roles by the EPA.  On noting the recent reports related to the River Fane, the EPA requested information from the local authorities involved, Louth and Monaghan County Councils. Both authorities have conducted inquiries into this matter with some operational support provided by the EPA. </p>  <p>  The EPA also immediately initiated communication with Irish Water in relation to this matter.  Irish Water has informed the EPA that they have carried out monitoring and it has not found PAHs in the River Fane abstraction point for the Dundalk supply. In addition, the EPA conducted an audit of the Dundalk drinking water plant on 5 February.  The initial findings were discussed with Irish Water on that day, and I understand that a report will be issued shortly.  The EPA is also in contact with cross-border authorities in relation to this matter and will remain in communication with the relevant authorities until it is brought to a satisfactory close. </p>  <p>  There is a culture of strong and active co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies.  My own Department, as part of on-going cooperation on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are on-going.</p>  <p>  There are well established structures in existence that provide a forum to deal with a variety of cross border issues, including waste arising from fuel laundering activities.  As indicated previously, I have written to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight again the problems being faced by border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime and I have signalled to him that this is an issue that I will be raising at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in May.  The council meets in the Environment Sector in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in a cross-border context in areas such as environmental protection, pollution, water quality management and waste management and this is, I believe, the most appropriate forum to address this serious issue from a waste and water quality perspective. </p>  <p>  The illegal deposition of waste material arising from diesel laundering activities presents the local authorities with major difficulties as the task of cleaning up the material needs to be dealt with to avoid threats to the environment.  The laundering process requires the use of chemicals such as sulphuric acid and bleaching agents and results in a waste by-product, a tar-like chemical compound or sludge, with significant potential for environmental pollution, particularly in relation to watercourses. </p>  <p>  I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions and these engagements will continue.</p></reply>

In total, my Department provided over &euro;77 million, between 2005 and 2010, to assist local authorities in improving access to public spaces, buildings and services for people with disabilities.  Funding was allocated annually for purposes of Disability Services to local authorities, on the basis of priority areas identified by them in implementation plans.</p><p>The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) takes a central role in the implementation of the Disability Strategy in the local government sector and provides a range of advice and support to local authorities in that regard.</p><p>The Building Control Act 1990 and the Building Regulations 1997-2014 set down the minimum, legally enforceable standards that must be applied to the design and construction of buildings, including in respect of access and use.  The statutory requirements are set out in the relevant parts included under the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations 1997-2014.  Technical guidance document Part M demonstrates how the statutory requirements in relation to access and use may be achieved in practice and aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.</p><p>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each planning authority&rsquo;s development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, <i>inter alia,</i>objectives for the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population.  Accordingly, planning authorities include objectives in their development plans as appropriate to take significant and inclusive account of relevant statutory obligations, including the building regulations.</p><p>Given the roles of the Building Control Act 1990, and Regulations made thereunder, and the Development Plan in specifying requirements and standards in relation to sustainable development generally, inclusive of access related matters, I am satisfied that the building control and planning processes fully support enhancement of access for all, including persons in wheelchairs.  I have therefore no plans to issue guidelines to planning authorities in this regard.</p></reply>

The statistics are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:by clicking &ldquo;Mortgage Data/Arrears in Local Authorities&rdquo; under the Housing Loans contents.  <i>The breakdown of arrears is only available for loans over 90 days, between 91 and 180 days and over 180 days.</i></p><p>On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, my Department launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It is fully recognised that people with mortgages borrowed from local authorities have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity over the last number of years.  The scale of the mortgage arrears problem amongst local authority borrowers necessitated the introduction of a Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme in February 2014 in line with the MTR Scheme in relation to mortgages from private institutions introduced nationally in June 2012.</p><p>The LAMTR scheme allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages. This enables families to stay in their home and their established community.  Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil.  Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.</p><p>LAMTR is just one of a range of short term and long term solutions available to local authority mortgage holders in arrears.  The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities.  In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  The most important step any family in arrears can take is to engage early with the Arrears Support Unit of the local authority.  Solutions are available and advice should be sought as early as possible.</p></reply>

As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will over time result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. </p>  <p>  A further important rationale for the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  The performance of different functions by members at county and municipal district levels will result in greater effectiveness than the previous parallel town and county system, which involved a significant element of duplication.  The division of functions between county and district has been determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level. Local matters are to be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are being decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind in relation to the new sub-county governance arrangements that we are in the very early stages of reform. Municipal districts only came into operation on 1 June 2014 and 2015 will be the first full year of their operation.  Against this background, I intend to have an evaluation process undertaken on the operation of the new structures through a broadly based advisory group which my Department is reconvening together with a working group for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government, both of which played an important role in the early stages of the local government reform process.  The groups will give particular consideration as to how the new governance arrangements are impacting on towns and whether any adjustments are needed in light of experience to date, including civic aspects, such as the status of mayors of borough and municipal districts and the economic and community development of towns.</p>  <p>  The thrust of Government policy remains to strengthen local government and foster the potential for improved subsidiarity, coherence and efficiency, resulting in greater value for money for the taxpayer and, ultimately, improved service delivery for citizens. The review that I am initiating will provide a sound evidence base upon which to consider any further developments to local government and local democracy.</p></reply>

This initiative does not involve the closure of libraries and, over time, the shared management structures will increase the scope for developing and enhancing services to the public, providing a broader range of services to the same high standard across the country. Indeed, t here will be no decrease in the number of library services or library branches arising from <i>Managing the Delivery of Effective Library Services</i>. </p><p>The local authorities that will be realigned to provide new structures serving a population in excess of 100,000 are:</p><p>-  Carlow/Kilkenny;</p><p>-  Cavan/Monaghan;</p><p>-  Laois/Offaly;</p><p>-  Leitrim/Roscommon/Sligo; and</p><p>-  Longford/Westmeath.</p><p>Cork City/Cork County, currently with affiliated services, would also become a shared service.

This approach to ensuring households in the group water sector receive equivalent support, while allowing for any transitional issues, to sustain improvement in quality in the sector, was reiterated on 19 November 2014, following a review of the water charging regime undertaken by the Government, the outcome of which was the announcement of a revised charging system for Irish Water customers.   </p>  <p>  Following completion of the review of the subsidisation of group water schemes the following revised subsidies are operative with effect from 1 January 2015.</p>  <p>- Subsidy A towards the general operational and management costs of group schemes served from a public source is &euro;40 (down from &euro;70);</p>  <p>- Subsidy A towards the general operational and management costs of group schemes served from a private source is &euro;95 (down from &euro;140); and</p>  <p>- Subsidy B towards the operational and maintenance costs associated with &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; Design Build Operate contracts for schemes which have their own water treatment facilities remains unchanged at &euro;220.</p>  <p>  The revised subsidies represent fair treatment between drinking water consumers in the public and group sectors having regard to the inherent differences in structure, funding and organisation between the sectors.</p>  <p>  The reply to Question No. 287 of 5 February 2015 set out the amount recouped by my Department to local authorities in respect of subsidies paid by the authorities towards the operational costs of group water schemes in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.</p>  <p>  The annual savings from the introduction of the changes in subsidies, which will impact on the rate of subsidisation from 2015 to 2018, are currently estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.2 million.  This amount is based on the number of houses for which Subsidy A was recouped to local authorities in 2014 qualifying for the full new subsidy amounts in 2015. However, this amount is likely to vary as some houses may not qualify, on the basis of incurred expenditure, for the full subsidy amount. In addition, the number of schemes applying for subsidy may vary from year to year.</p>  <p>  To promote sustainable use of water and to enhance water conservation in households, the Department of Social Protection will administer, on behalf of my Department, a &euro;100 water conservation grant for households (primary dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process. This will also apply in the case of group water scheme households.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to continuing to support the group water sector as an important element of the water industry in Ireland, founded on co-operative community and voluntary engagement, and to invest in the sector to sustain and improve quality standards and performance.  </p></reply>

The selection, prioritisation and approval of individual scheme proposals for advancement and funding under the programme is, therefore, a matter for the local authorities.</p>  <p>  The National Rural Water Services Committee, which has a role in advising me in relation to policy and investment in rural water services, has been considering issues arising for the establishment of new group water schemes, particularly where the costs involved call into question the viability of the scheme.  Following a recommendation by the Committee, an increase of &euro;1,000 in the maximum grant per house applying to new group water schemes was announced in April 2014.  My Department, therefore, now funds 85% of the cost of such schemes, subject to a maximum grant per house of &euro;7,475, rather than the previous limit of &euro;6,475 per house.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering, in the context of the 2015 Rural Water Programme, a recommendation from the Committee relating to new group water schemes which it may previously have been possible to consider for CLAR (Ceantair Laga Ard-Riachtanais) funding which was administered by the former Department of Community, Rural &amp;amp; Gaeltacht Affairs.

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums.   This includes, in accordance with section 94 of the Electoral Act 1992, the provision of a sufficient number of polling stations, conveniently distributed for the accommodation of the electors entitled to vote there. In advance of elections and referendums, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform makes an order setting out a schedule of charges that are acceptable for the purposes of conducting the election or referendum, as appropriate.  The position in relation to insurance for schools was set out in the Order, made by the Minister for the European and local elections held in May 2014.  It provided that as the cost of running elections / referendums are borne by the State, it was not necessary for local returning officers to arrange insurance.  It further clarified that claims taken against local returning officers and their staff engaged in carrying out their duties in accordance with the Electoral Acts would be dealt with under State Indemnity by the State Claims Agency and the Chief State Solicitor's Office  . </p>  <p>On the matter of public liability insurance in relation to schools used for election purposes,  the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised returning officers of the view of the State Claims Agency that schools would have adequate public liability insurance and that there should be no need for schools to take out additional insurance for elections.  If their cover was found to be inadequate, it is possible that their legal liability for some claims would fall on the State because their insurance cover was not sufficient to meet their legal liability.  </p></reply>

Tenderers have now been informed of the outcome of their tender and Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) are in the process of issuing contracts to the successful tenderers.</p><p>It should be noted that as there is currently a 14 day standstill period in place, the public procurement process is still ongoing and, therefore, confidentiality requirements continue to apply.  Following contract signature, Pobal will publish a Contract Award Notice in the Official Journal of the EU (/) and on the eTenders website () announcing the results of the procurement process. Such notice is likely to be published in early April 2015.</p><p>Consistent with the transitional arrangements to extend the LCDP until the roll out of SICAP in April 2015 and to ensure business continuity, interim LCDP funding is being provided to the Cherry Orchard Equine, Education and Training Centre up to end March 2015, pending the conclusion of the SICAP competitive process.</p><p>My Department appreciates the importance of the work of the Cherry Orchard Equine Centre. However, the issues involved are broader than just those relating to SICAP.  With regard to funding post March 2015, my Department and Dublin City Council are currently exploring options for a feasible approach and will be in contact with Cherry Orchard Equine Centre in that regard in the near future.  </p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. </p>  <p>  The maximum grant per beneficiary for equipment is as follows:</p>  <p>  -  Monitored personal alarms (with pendant) - &euro;250</p>  <p>  -  Additional pendant/Re-installation - &euro;50</p>  <p>  The cost of monitoring the alarm is not covered under the scheme; annual monitoring costs (generally between &euro;60 - &euro;80 per annum) are borne by the beneficiary.  The contract for monitoring services is a matter between the beneficiary and the monitoring service provider; my Department has no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  The funding allocated for the Seniors Alert Scheme has been maintained at &euro;2.35 million over the last three years which is sufficient to meet current demand levels for this important Scheme.  The Scheme is a demand-led scheme and actual expenditure in any year can vary.</p>  <p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.  There are no implications for existing installations in respect of the Pobal tender competition.  Under the new arrangements, Pobal are offering a facility for beneficiaries to choose from a panel of monitoring companies, if desired.  Beneficiaries are free to continue with their current monitoring company; there is no onus on anyone to change from their existing provider.</p>  <p>  The operational handover between my Department and Pobal is proceeding and should be completed mid-year.  In the meantime Community and Voluntary Groups wishing to draw down grant support under the Seniors Alert Scheme can continue to apply to my Department in the usual way.</p>  <p>  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly.  It will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and engage with the elderly in the local community.</p></reply>

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil.</p>  <p>  The value of a gas field will depend on a combination of factors including the volume of recoverable gas, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production. As such it would be a speculative exercise to provide a total estimated value of commercial gas discoveries off the Irish coast.</p>  <p>  Profits from the three producing gas fields are taxed at a corporation rate of 25% (double the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income).  In addition, royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  The combination of tax, royalties and acreage rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.</p>  <p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987 (following the lead of the UK and Norway who abolished royalties for new fields in 1982 and 1986 respectively).</p>  <p>  The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field, which is expected to come into production in 2015, will be through acreage rental fees and the 25% corporation tax on profits.</p>  <p>  In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by international energy consultants Wood Mackenzie.  A key recommendation of Wood Mackenzie was that tax rates in respect of new licences should be revised to ensure a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields.  This would result in the application of maximum rate of 55% in the case of new licences.  My Department is working with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to give operational effect to this approach.</p></reply>

In November 2007 a revised application was received seeking an Onshore Licensing Option and Petroleum Prospecting Licence relating to unconventional gas exploration and extraction in respect of an onshore area in South County Wexford.</p>  <p>  In October 2008, following on correspondence and discussions between the Department and the applicant, the Department advised the applicant that the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas, Exploration, Development and Production 2007 required that applications for any petroleum authorisation are accepted from companies incorporated under the laws of a Member State of the European Union or from foreign companies, and that the application did not meet this requirement.  The Department also indicated that in the event that a company was subsequently registered it would be necessary to resubmit an application and independent confirmation of the availability of sufficient funds to meet the cost of any work programme associated with the proposed petroleum authorisation.</p>  <p>  In November 2009 the Department was advised by the applicant that it was intended to register with the Companies Registration Office in 2010.</p>  <p>  In January 2013 a letter was received from the applicant stating that it wished to proceed with the application made in 2007.</p>  <p>  In January 2013 the Department wrote to the applicant restating the position of October 2008, and advising that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would be undertaking a major research programme into the potential environmental impacts of onshore exploration for unconventional gas resources, and that in the light of the EPA&rsquo;s research programme, no applications for petroleum exploration authorisations in respect of onshore areas will be considered, or finalised until after the EPA research has been concluded and there has been time to consider its findings.</p></reply>

The first such EU Regulation commenced in 2007.  Two further EU Regulations were introduced in 2010 and 2012 to further reduce the maximum permitted retail roaming charges within the EU and to increase consumer protection measures by requiring service providers to inform users of the roaming charges they may incur and additional requirements to curtail services in order to avoid bill shocks in any billing period.</p>  <p>  Ireland supported each of the three EU Roaming Regulations which the EU Commission calculates has achieved regulated retail roaming price reductions of over 80% since 2007 in calls, SMS and data.  Data roaming retail charges across the EU are now over 90% cheaper than in 2007.</p>  <p>  These reductions have benefitted all mobile phone users without any adverse impacts on users who do not use roaming services.  This was achieved by reducing both wholesale and retail prices simultaneously.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, the European Commission introduced a wide range of proposed measures, including changes to current roaming regulations, as part of a comprehensive Telecoms Single Market (TSM) package.</p>  <p>  In early 2014, the then out-going European Parliament, having discussed the TSM proposal, voted to significantly amend the Commission's original proposals and proposed instead a Roam Like At Home (RLAH) approach which would have seen the abolition of roaming charges within the EU by December 2015.</p>  <p>  The Parliament&rsquo;s proposal does not prohibit the imposition of wholesale charges to recover the costs of providing the roaming service to customers.  If service providers are prohibited from recovering those wholesale costs directly from retail users, it is inevitable they will seek to recover the costs from other users or reduce volume limits in bundled minutes and data package limits, in order to control costs.  These outcomes do not serve the long term interests of consumers.</p>  <p>  The European Council has been discussing the roaming proposals for several months now and at a recent meeting Ireland along with all Member States agreed to give the Latvian Presidency a mandate to enter into negotiations with the European Parliament on a revised set of proposals on roaming charges across the EU.  This will significantly reduce regulated roaming charges further when agreed.</p></reply>

It would not be appropriate to exclude any fuel option from such a broad policy consultation and engagement process.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the use of nuclear fission for the generation of nuclear power is statutorily prohibited by (i) the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006 which prohibits the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission, and (ii) the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, which makes similar prohibitive provision in respect of regulatory authorisations. There are no plans to bring forward any proposals to amend the existing statutory provisions.</p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport.  To date onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.</p>  <p>  Irish energy policy also recognises the potential to diversify our renewable electricity generation portfolio in the period to 2020 and beyond.  To that end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, published in February last year, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources.  Furthermore the Draft Bioenergy Plan published in October 2014, acknowledges the role that the bioenergy sector can play in the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>  <p>  Enhanced energy connectivity has the potential to help energy consumers benefit from a fully integrated European Internal Energy Market, as well as increasing the contribution that renewable energy can make to meeting our energy requirements.  In this regard, I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s Energy Union package adopted on 25 February, which included the Communication on achieving greater electricity interconnection of all Member States.  The completion of the North South Transmission Line project and additional possible interconnections with both the UK and France would enhance our electricity interconnectivity and bring significant benefits in terms of energy security, competitiveness and sustainability.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 and includes Kilrush County Clare.</p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.  The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises/home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.  A public consultation on the map, which commenced in November, closed on the 12th February last.  29 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks.  This will help inform the key decisions that require to be taken in order to finalise our comprehensive Intervention Strategy which I intend publishing for consultation in July next.</p><p>The strategy will address a range of important issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership and governance options, funding issues and levels of service for end-users.  Part of the analysis being undertaken involves consideration of identifying and prioritising strategic connection points such as enterprise parks, schools and other points of economic or social activity within rural communities.</p><p>The proposed Intervention will also be subject to State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </p><p>Following the public consultation this summer, a detailed procurement process, in line with EU and Irish procurement rules, will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design the tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

They will be  examined  by my officials with a view to submitting recommendations to me which I will consider in due course.   While I believe that the issues involved are important, given the other competing priorities which my Department is currently dealing with in the area of road safety and in other areas, it is likely to be later in the year before we can turn our attention to this issue.   </p>  <p>  In compiling its report, the RSA engaged in a comprehensive public consultation exercise that attracted in the region of 2,000 submissions, mostly from the people directly involved with the various clubs associated with the vintage and veteran vehicle movement.  </p></reply>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.     </p>  <p>  The NRA has an established strategy regarding the provision of signage on national roads for major tourist and leisure attractions and facilities, as set out in their document "Policy on the Provision of Tourist &amp;amp; Leisure Signage on National Roads".  Signage in accordance with this policy is erected as an aid to safe and efficient navigation, rather than as a means of advertising or promoting any particular business or premises.   </p>  <p>  The Authority's national road signage schemes are implemented following extensive consultation involving the Authority, the local authorities concerned and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  In this regard, it should be noted that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a number of requirements which must be satisfied before they will recommend a particular tourist destination for signage off the national road network.  These include adequate provision for parking, consideration of the facilities available at the venue and so forth. </p></reply>

These are categorised as follows:  </p><p>- &quot;Culturally Curious&quot;: Travellers in the over 45 age group taking a holiday with their partner, who wish to expand their experience by exploring new landscapes, history and culture.</p><p>- &quot;Great Escapers&quot;:  These tend to be younger and are specifically interested in rural holidays.  Great Escapers are on holiday to take time out, and experience nature at close range.</p><p>- &quot;Social Energisers&quot;:  Younger visitors who like to holiday in groups or as couples.  They may be friends or colleagues looking for an exciting trip to a new and vibrant destination.</p><p>Tourism Ireland's overseas marketing activity is weighted towards these segments in order to provide the best return on marketing investment.</p><p>In the longer term, the new Tourism Policy Statement &quot;People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025&quot; will be officially launched later this month.  The three headline targets, to be achieved by 2025 are as follows:</p><p>- Revenue from overseas tourism, excluding air fares and ferry charges, will rise from &euro;3.3 billion in 2013 to &euro;5 billion per year by 2025 net of inflation,</p><p>- 250,000 people employed in tourism by 2025, compared with approximately 200,000 at present.</p><p>- Attract ten million overseas visits to Ireland by 2025, compared to 7.6 million for 2014.</p><p>I look forward to working with the tourism sector and the tourism agencies to achieve the targets contained in the Policy Statement.</p></reply>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.     </p>  <p>  With regard to the Osberstown interchange and the Sallins bypass the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State grants.    </p>  <p>  Owing to the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure in recent years.  The reality is that the available funds simply do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing road infrastructure or address demands for new road improvement projects.  Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million for the national, regional and local road network.  Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and my ability to progress new projects and PPPs is limited.   </p>  <p>  I have acknowledged in previously responses to the Deputy and I reiterate again today that it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained but, as of now, I am not in a position to give a commitment in regard to funding of the projects in question, although I acknowledge their national and local importance.</p></reply>

It will also reflect on the legacy of that period and look towards our future, based around the themes set out in the Government's framework plan. I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary in 2016 will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful. </p><p>A dedicated 2016 Project Office has been established in my Department and is currently engaged in an extensive consultation process across the Government, State agency and community sectors in order to progress the development of a rich programme for 2016, details of which will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>In order to facilitate engagement with local communities and people of all ages nationwide, I have met with the County and Cities Management Association and have requested each local authority CEO to lead on the development of local-level plans for <i>Ireland 2016</i>in their individual counties during 2015.  Dedicated <i>Ireland 2016</i>co-ordinators and steering groups have been put in place in each local authority to help to shape and drive the relevant county programmes.  I recently met with Cathaoirligh and Mayors from all counties and cities, together with the <i>Ireland 2016</i>co-ordinators, to kick start this process.  A series of public meetings will now be undertaken in each county, at which members of the public can come together to hear about <i>Ireland 2016</i>, meet those involved in their community, and to explore and learn about how they can get involved.  I have allocated funding of &euro;1 million to local authorities in 2015 to support this overall process.</p><p>In addition, since the launch of the <i>Ireland 2016</i><b></b>initiative, I have convened two meetings of the All-Party Oireachtas Group on Commemorations, of which I am Chair.  The Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, which is chaired by Dr Maurice Manning, has also met on two occasions since that date.  The first meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the 1916 Commemorations, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, took place on 3<sup></sup>February 2015 and meets for the second time today, 10 March.  </p><p>Meetings have also taken place with other key Departments, agencies, local authorities and interested parties.  My Department's 2016 Project Office is engaging with the National Cultural Institutions, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland and the Heritage Council to ensure that a comprehensive and diverse cultural programme is developed.  Meetings and a dedicated workshop have also been held with a wide range of Irish language groups in order to develop an Irish language programme.  My Department has been working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to develop an appropriate programme involving the Irish Diaspora and with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure the involvement of primary and post-primary schools and the third-level education sector.  My Department has also been engaging with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the views of children are taken on board and that they have a meaningful contribution to make.</p><p>The relatives of those who fought and those who died during the Rising will play a key role in the <i>Ireland 2016</i>programme and I am actively engaging with them to ensure that will have a central involvement in a number of key State events and that their views on the overall programme are considered.  My officials and I have met with a number of relatives, including representatives of relatives&rsquo; groups and individual relatives, to highlight the important role that they will have in the plans to commemorate the centenary of the events of Easter 1916.  </p><p>My Department is also working closely with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Department of Defence to ensure that a full programme of State commemorative events is developed, which is respectful to all those were affected by the events of the Rising.</p><p>In addition to this, my Department continues to engage with members of the public on their ideas for 2016. Over one hundred proposals have been received in the 2016 Project Office to date from members of the public and interested parties - via email, postal submissions and through the project website, - and I very much appreciate and welcome all ideas and submissions received.</p><p>I look forward to continuing engagement with all stakeholders and members of the public as the <i>Ireland 2016</i>initiative develops.  </p></reply>

The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the species and gender of deer. My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as the National Parks.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  </p>  <p>  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners who may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.
