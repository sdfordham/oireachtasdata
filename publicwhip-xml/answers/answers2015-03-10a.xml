Dublin Bus undertook a substantial campaign to notify their customers.  In addition to use of web/social media and advertising in the press, they distributed 190,000 leaflets and they deployed staff at existing stops informing customers of the changes.  NTA has advised me that to date the changes have been running smoothly.</p>  <p>  There was no reduction in the number of bus services arising from these route changes.  In terms of journey times, average journey times on certain of the diverted routes, including Bus Route 15, have improved following the rerouting.  On other routes using the Westland Row corridor, average journey times did increase slightly due to the slightly longer distance travelled.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future and increased travel demand as the economy recovers further, I recently asked the NTA, as the agency responsible for strategic traffic management in the GDA, to work with the NRA and the GDA local authorities to prepare a report on congestion and to outline actions and investment to address the issue.  I understand that the NTA is close to finalising the report in conjunction with the other agencies.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank city centre retailers and businesses, as well as commuters, for their cooperation and patience during these works.  </p></reply>

The M50 is the most heavily trafficked road in the country with in excess of 130,000 vehicles per day using several sections.  Peak period traffic volumes compromise 44% of the total daily average, with volumes at peak times being an average of 2.3 times higher than off peak volumes.</p>  <p>  A substantial  upgrade of the M50 was completed in 2010. This resulted in the addition of a third lane in both directions from the M1 to Sandyford and a fourth auxiliary lane in places together with the development of freeflow junctions and the introduction of barrier free tolling.  This major investment has significantly enhanced the capacity of the motorway.</p>  <p>  I would also remind the House of the substantial upgrade at Newlands Cross, part of the &euro;282m N7/N11 Arklow to Rathnew PPP scheme, which allows for a continuous, free-flowing route between the M50 and our the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny.</p>  <p>  There are no proposals at present for further investment in additional capacity.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions attached to an Bord Plean&aacute;la's approval of the upgrade was the publication of a scheme of demand management measures.  The NRA in conjunction with the relevant local authorities published its M50 Demand Management Report in April 2014.</p>  <p>Looking to the future and increased travel demand  as the economy recovers further I asked the National Transport Authority, as the agency responsible for strategic traffic management in the GDA, to work with the NRA and the GDA local authorities to prepare a report on congestion and to outline actions and investment that might be required in the short, medium and long term. I understand that the NTA is close to finalising the report in conjunction with the other agencies.  </p></reply>

When I took office, I was well aware that there had previously been an imbalance in funding from the Programme when measured on a per capita basis across counties.  I decided that, in the interest of equity, I should try to redress that imbalance.  Therefore, in 2012,  I decided that counties that had fared less well under previous rounds of the Programme would receive more money per capita than counties who had historically received more than their per capita share.  Again in 2014 I provided more money to counties which hadn&rsquo;t fared as well as others under previous rounds.</p>  <p>  Special priority is also given to projects in designated disadvantaged areas.  These projects are permitted to have lower levels of own funding and gain additional marks in the assessment process.</p>  <p>Because of these changes, I believe that the distribution of funds under the Programme is now more equitable than at any time in the past.  </p></reply>

Decisions on how Co. Donegal is marketed overseas are matters for Tourism Ireland Limited and these decisions are not subject to my approval.  Accordingly, I have referred the Deputy's question to Tourism Ireland for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p><p>I am aware however, that Donegal and the North West continue to feature prominently in the agency's global marketing activity.  According to the agency, in 2014 positive publicity for Donegal worth an estimated &euro;35<font color="#FF0000"> </font>million in equivalent advertising value was generated  in key markets around the world, through media visits, press releases, e-newsletters and media events.  The agency undertakes an extensive programme of familiarisation visits for influential travel and lifestyle journalists from around the world, so that they will encourage prospective holidaymakers to come to Donegal and the North West, through their articles and broadcasts about the destination.  The Wild Atlantic Way also continues as a priority focus for overseas marketing activity this year.</p><p>In terms of the Government's overall tourism objectives, in the coming weeks we will launch the new Tourism Policy Statement, &ldquo;People Place and Policy&rdquo;, which will prioritise investment to maximise the benefits for the tourism sector in all regions in the period to 2025.  It contains ambitious growth targets and  will build on the complementary strengths of our tourism offering, including our uniquely friendly and welcoming people, the beauty and historic heritage of our places and the support and commitment of Government.  It will address issues such as a switch in focus from visitor numbers to visitor revenue, the sustainable development of our tourism infrastructure, the development of increased community engagement with tourism, and ensuring that the tourism sector has the appropriate skills to meet the needs of future visitors.</p></reply>

While the D&uacute;n Laoghaire service has been greatly reduced in recent years the financial impact on the port is significant and challenging and it is clear that the company faces a very different financial and operating environment.</p>  <p>  In announcing the decision to allow for a community led approach toward the development of local  Diaspora Centres, I was clear that the decision not to go ahead with a National Diaspora Centre as a State-backed project does not preclude any other proposal, which is financially robust, from going ahead, and I am aware that D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company has plans in this regard.</p>  <p>  Currently the statutory responsibility for the development of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour vests in the Board of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and I recently met with the full Board to discuss their views on the future. The Board is currently finalising a revised corporate plan which I expect to receive shortly for consideration and comment and which will greatly inform our overall strategic consideration of the issues facing the company and the harbour generally.</p>  <p>  I am clear that, in line with National Ports Policy, the sustainable development of the harbour is best placed within a local authority led governance structure.  As part of this, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council will shortly commence a due diligence process, which, together with the company&rsquo;s own corporate plan, will greatly assist in our strategic consideration of relevant issues.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently finalising the text of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2015.  I expect to seek Government approval of the Bill in the coming months and commence its passage through the Oireachtas.

These include additional Vehicle Inspectors and call centre staff; the provision of new test lanes in 4 test centres; and the extension of opening hours at a number of others.  The majority of test centres have late openings on 3 days a week to 10pm and 20 centres now have extended opening on four days per week.</p>  <p>  A further innovation that was introduced last week is the provision, for four days each week, of a 24-hour NCT service in test centres in Dublin and Cork.  In Dublin, this service is shared between the test centres at Northpoint and Deansgrange.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.70.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000062#WRA07200"><p>I would like to state at the outset that there is no blanket policy of using the Compulsory Purchase Order method for acquiring lands for greenways.  There are a number of models for using land for greenways only one of which is CPO.</p>  <p>  With regard to the various models used to deliver individual projects, it is a matter for the County Council in charge of delivering a specific project to consider access to land on a case by case basis and take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  In the event of a proposed route traversing private land there are a number of options that can be considered by the authority, the first being the permissive access model.  This is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level.  It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners.  Indeed, the most well-known Greenway in the country, the Great Western Greenway from Westport to Achill, has been built using the permissive access model.</p>  <p>  While I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided on.  There is no one size fits all approach to this.</p>  <p>  As stated above, negotiated permissive access from the perspectives of cost and public ownership has value but, for projects of national scale, such as the Dublin to Galway greenway, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land and involve major state investment, it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  </p></reply>

This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of TDs introducing their own Bills from 14 Private Members Bills published by TDs in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.  82 Private Members Bills have been debated in the 31st D&aacute;il to the 6th March 2015 compared to 16 debated in the 30th D&aacute;il.  21 Committee Reports have been debated in the 31st D&aacute;il to 6th March 2015 compared to 9 debated in the 30th D&aacute;il.</p><p>- The pre-Legislative review system which is a requirement for all non-emergency legislation.</p><p>- Restructuring of the Oireachtas Committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16.</p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has also been expanded.</p><p>In addition, as a result of a set of reforms introduced to reduce the use of the guillotine, just 3 Bills were guillotined in the D&aacute;il in 2014 down from 12 in 2013 and from 19 in 2010.  This has been achieved by such reforms as reducing the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year, increasing the time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il (by increasing the number of total sitting days, and extending each sitting day.</p><p>The Government has also improved the way legislation in the Chamber is debated:</p><p>- At First Stage the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now has 5 minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain their reasons for drafting the legislation.</p><p>- At Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage shall have a speaking slot, of the same length as the Minister or Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on its findings.</p><p>- At the end of the second stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies chosen by the Ceann Comhairle who had previously spoken.</p><p>Taken together, these reforms show a real commitment by Government to continue to meet its commitments in this area as outlined in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

There are approximately 70,200 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.</p>  <p>  The Department has measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme.  Notices circulated to Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014.  A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate interventions continue to be provided in a consistent manner where rent supplement recipients have been threatened with homelessness due to rising rents.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to monitor the measures in place to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided to rent supplement recipients with the Interim Tenancy Sustainment protocol operating in Dublin now being extended to include single persons and couples; the protocol was also extended to Cork city in January 2015.  The protocol has assisted approximately 390 families to date.  The Department&rsquo;s response to the current difficulties in the private rented market remains under close review.</p>  <p>  Following engagement with the Department the main property websites have removed the advertising option which filtered rent supplement recipients from their websites. The Department is also engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the issue of some potential landlords refusing rent supplement tenancies and welcomes the recent announcement that they propose to address the issue with an amendment contained in the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015.</p>  <p>  It remains open to any person who has been refused a private tenancy and who feels discriminated against on the basis of the nine grounds set out in the equality legislation to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts.</p>  <p>  If an existing  tenant in receipt of rent supplement has an issue with rent levels they should contact their local Community Welfare Service representative for assistance.</p></reply>

The research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate of &euro;186 per week.  The scheme was discontinued on the basis of this evidence and I have no plans to reverse this decision.</p>  <p>  Payment of the supplement will continue to be made to the existing 4,800 recipients for as long as they continue to be entitled to the payment.  In cases of particular hardship that may present, officials have the legislative power to award a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in cases of exceptional need.</p></reply>

However this figure is based on a calculation of the total number of children of Direct Provision Allowance (DPA) claimants, without any knowledge of whether they would meet the qualifying criteria as set out above.

The placements are in organisations operating in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  Internship opportunities can vary significantly spanning many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  </p>  <p>  The principal aim of the scheme is to provide interns with an opportunity to keep close to the labour market while gaining valuable experience in a working environment.  Records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals have progressed into employment across various occupations/ disciplines on completion of their internship placements.</p>  <p>  A variety of measures have been introduced to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme.  In order for an application from a Host Organisation to be approved the host organisation must meet a number of criteria.  These criteria are to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.</p>  <p>  Participation in the scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge team at any stage of their Internship for advice and support.  Additionally, any individual, who has concerns regarding an internship or where they feel that an organisation may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, they should contact the JobBridge team by calling 046 9738080 or Freephone 1890 8000 24.</p>  <p>  Case Officers in Donegal are not aware of any issues with the administration of Job Bridge  in the organisations mentioned in the PQ.

Unfortunately, the Department does not operate any scheme which would be able to provide funding of this nature.</p>  <p>  The Department supports community initiatives through community work placement programmes such as community employment, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  These programmes are delivery locally through sponsor organisations or local development companies.  The Deputy should note that the additional resources provided through these programmes are mainly geared towards the provision of materials and to cover input and operating costs associated with work placements and training.</p></reply>

To qualify for the payment, a customer must be a farmer, farming land in the State, aged between 18 and 66 and satisfy a means test.</p>  <p>  The means test for Farm Assist takes account of virtually every form of income but assesses it in different ways and disregards various amounts.  Different rules apply to income from farming and other forms of self-employment, income from certain schemes such as the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS) and Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), income from employment and income from property and capital.</p>  <p>  The application form for the Farm Assist scheme asks the customer to supply farm receipts and invoices in date order to confirm income, sales, purchases and expenses covering the last 12 months.</p>  <p>  This form does not have space to outline their farm outgoings as it would typically not be feasible for customers to list the entire farm operating costs for the previous 12 month period on an application form. However, a customer can supply details of outgoings with the completed application form if they so wish.</p>  <p>  An examination of farm outgoings is included in the assessment process and the Social Welfare Inspector takes a detailed account of all operating costs when interviewing the customer.  This usually gives the customer a good opportunity to explain both the income generated and the operating costs associated with the farm directly with an Inspector.</p></reply>

Information providers support their clients to act on their own behalf wherever possible (self-advocacy). They also advocate directly on behalf of their clients through contacting and negotiating with third parties or attending meetings, hearings or appeals.</p><p>In 2014, the nationwide network of CISs was allocated funding of some &euro;12.5 million from CIB&rsquo;s overall budget allocation of &euro;46 million.  During 2014, CISs provided an advocacy service to over<b></b>2,500 people.  Overall, 56% of advocacy issues related to social welfare, 22% related to employment issues, 8% to housing issues with the balance relating to health, consumer affairs and moving country.  In addition, during the same period, the CIS&rsquo;s assisted over 7,000 clients with once-off advocacy<b></b>requirements.</p><p>In 2011, the National Advocacy Service (NAS) was established under the Citizens Information Board to provide an independent, confidential, and free representative advocacy service to vulnerable people with disabilities who cannot self-advocate, while supporting others to use mainstream services.  The National Advocacy Service has its national office in Dublin, and provides services through its four regions.  Funding of &euro;3.07 million was made available to NAS in 2014 from the CIB.</p><p>During 2014, NAS provided an advocacy service to some 1,012 people.  This number includes over 340 new cases.  Overall, 28% of advocacy cases related to housing issues, 19% related to health issues, 13% related to social welfare and 11% to justice issues, while a further 7% related to court cases regarding children.  The remainder involved birth, family and relationship, finance, taxation, education, employment, travel and recreation and bereavement related cases.</p></reply>

There has been a recovery in economic growth and employment, with the unemployment rate falling from 13.1% in 2013 and to 11.3% in 2014.  This indicates that employment opportunities are becoming available.

In the current labour market environment JobBridge provides individuals with a unique opportunity to secure work experience in a new field.</p><p>The scheme has made very significant progress since it came into operation in July 2011.  To date some 37,700 internship placements have commenced with over 6,100 participants currently undertaking internships and over 1,000 internship posts available on the JobsIreland website.</p><p>A variety of measures have been introduced to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme.  In order for an application from a host organisation to be approved it must meet a number of criteria and the host organisation must accept the terms and conditions of the scheme before their application can be processed.</p><p>The full list of the criteria for host organisations is listed on the Jobbridge Section of the Department&rsquo;s website , which includes the following:</p><p>- In order to qualify for an internship an organisation must have a minimum of 1 full time employee who is employed for 30 hours or more per week;</p><p>- The host organisation must be a legal entity and/or a charity recognised by the Revenue Commissioners;</p><p>- The host organisation may not provide an internship opportunity under the Scheme to an individual they have an existing or had a previous employment relationship with;</p><p>- The host organisation may not have vacancies in the area of activity in which the internship is offered; and</p><p>- The internship cannot displace an employee. The scheme administrator reserves the right to review cases where it is reported that this is the case.</p><p>These criteria are to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the intern.  Additionally in order for an internship to commence a Standard Agreement must be signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation.  This Agreement clearly sets out the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship. The Department has a robust monitoring system in place to ensure compliance with the scheme criteria.</p><p>It is also worth noting that participation in the scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge Team at any stage of their internship for advice and support.  Consequently, any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, including cases of suspected displacement and quality, may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are taken seriously by the Department and are fully investigated.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-10a.187.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000065#WRD01100"><p>In the scenario provided by the Deputy, an individual working 19.5 hours on minimum wage, would earn approximately &euro;169 a week. Together with the salary, and the figures provided for one-parent family payment (OFP) and family income supplement (FIS), and fuel allowance, this amounts to a cumulative total of &euro;459 per week.  It should be noted that Fuel Allowance is payable on OFP and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) but not FIS.  Fuel Allowance averages out to &euro;10 per week.</p>  <p>  On foot of the July 2015 changes, OFP recipients already in receipt of FIS will see their FIS payment re-rated to take account for the loss of their OFP.   All customers who transition from OFP to a FIS payment, will be able to apply for the back to work family dividend (BTWFD).  The BTWFD allows these customers to retain the child proportion of their payment, which equals &euro;29.80 per week per child (up to a maximum of &euro;119.20 for four children), for two years, with full entitlement for the first year and 50% entitlement for the second year.</p>  <p>  An individual in the situation outlined above will continue to have a salary of &euro;169 a week.  Their family income supplement will be re-rated to &euro;202 a week and they will also be eligible to apply for the BTWFD which amounts to &euro;29.80 per child a week.  On this basis, their revised income will be &euro;400.80.</p>  <p>  I think it is important to highlight that there has been a recovery in economic growth and employment, with the unemployment rate falling from 13.1% in 2013 to 11.3% in 2014.  This indicates that there are additional employment opportunities available and that, as the economy improves, wages may increase impacting positively on an individual in this situation.  </p>  <p>  Before I introduced the reforms, the One Parent Family Payment was a passive scheme with limited engagement by the State with recipients. For many lone parents, most of whom are women, this has meant long-term social welfare dependency, associated poverty and social exclusion for them and their families.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely. These reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to access the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment programmes, to develop their skills set and, ultimately, to secure employment and financial independence.</p></reply>

Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services.  In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase.  </p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.  </p></reply>

This involves, among other things, the checking and inspection of bulk fuel transportation vehicles, including, from time to time, the taking of fuel samples from such vehicles.</p><p>The checking of vehicles and the taking of fuel samples may be carried out only  by officers who have been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to do so, and only officers who have received appropriate training may take samples.  This training is provided by a qualified mechanic who is a Revenue employee, in conjunction with Revenue's Training Branch, and covers the correct procedures for obtaining samples, the safe use of specialised equipment for doing so and health and safety matters, including the appropriate isolation from members of the public of the vehicle from which a sample is being taken.</p><p>I am informed also that the sampling of bulk transportation vehicles is undertaken in accordance with strict health and safety protocols, and may be carried out only by officers trained specifically for that task.  To date, 35 officers, based at locations around the country, have received this training.</p><p>The specific safety regime applied in respect of a vehicle from which samples are being taken depends on the type of fuel being carried by the bulk fuel transportation vehicle. Vehicles carrying diesel type fuels (that is, road diesel, marked gas oil or kerosene) may occasionally, depending on the nature of the location concerned, be sampled at roadside checkpoints.  Bulk fuel transportation vehicles carrying petrol or suspected of doing so are always removed to a safe and secure location for the carrying out of the sampling. A health and safety risk assessment is carried out by the senior officer present before a decision is made to proceed with sampling.</p><p>The numbers of samples of petrol and diesel that have been taken from bulk fuel transportation vehicles from 2011 to date are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total No. Samples</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (to 6 March)</td><td>9</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These include establishing operational capability with funders and lending partners, building internal systems and business processes and establishing a team to safely and effectively manage the funding provided on behalf of the State. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the SBCI launched its first product programme on the 19th February 2015 and lending commenced on the 9th   March 2015 through both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank Plc.  An initial sum of &euro;400m has been allocated between Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks Plc. for lending to SMEs.  The Government's aim for the SBCI is to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland.  The SBCI will achieve this by working with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market through allocating the remaining &euro;400m to a number of new and non-traditional SME finance providers.  It is also an objective of the SBCI to encourage competition within the SME funding market through the provision of funding to a broad range of potential lending partners.  </p>  <p>  The allocation  of funding across a broader range of lending partners diversifies risk for the SBCI and is prudent in the context of managing funds provided by the state and other funding partners including EIB and KfW.   </p>  <p>  At present, the SBCI is actively engaged with other potential lending partners in regards to their operational capability with the ambition to become SBCI lending partners during 2015 thereby providing Irish SMEs with greater choice in securing the most appropriate funding for their business needs.</p></reply>

Provisions for the VAT exemption applicable to medical services are contained in Paragraphs 2(3) and 2 (7) of Schedule 1 to the Value - Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  Details of the relevant provisions are as follows:</p><p>- Professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health and Children (other than dental or optical services), but only if those services are not supplied in the course of carrying on a business that wholly or partly consists of selling goods.</p><p>- Other professional medical care services that, on 1 January 2010, were recognised by the Revenue Commissioners as exempt activities. </p><p>These provisions transpose Article 132 (1) (c) of the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC on which Irish VAT law is based and with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Professional medical care services recognised by the Department of Health and Children, and which qualify for VAT exemption, are generally those medical care services supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries.  These include persons registered under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, persons registered under the Nurses Act 1985 and dieticians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers and speech and language therapists designated under Section 4(1) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The exemption also applies to chiropodists, chiropractors and osteopaths since these medical care services were recognised by the Revenue Commissioners as exempt activities on 1 January 2010.</p><p>Other services, including craniosacral therapy, cannot benefit from the medical services exemption except in the very unusual circumstances where a doctor makes a composite supply for a single consideration of exempt medical services and craniosacral therapy and the exempt services are regarded as the principal supply. In these circumstances the entire supply is treated as exempt.  I would refer the Deputy to the Revenue publication Medical Service on the Revenue website that provides additional information in relation to the VAT treatment of Medical Services ().</p></reply>

I am retaining the child ceiling of &euro;500 for those aged 18 to 20 that are continuing to avail of insurance at the child premium rates.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have agreed to operate the changes on an administrative basis pending the provision of the underpinning legislation as part of the next Finance Bill. Therefore, the changes will be effective for all policies purchased or renewed (or which come into effect) on or after 1 May 2015.</p>  <p>  The current regime for tax relief on medical insurance premiums provides a maximum tax relief ceiling of &euro;500 in respect of a child, which is defined as an individual under the age of 18 years or, if over 18 years of age and under 23 years of age, who is receiving full-time education and in respect of whom a child premium is paid.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is not compulsory for insurers to offer child premium rates to young adults under the current system and it will not be compulsory for them to offer reduced premiums under the new system.  Therefore, where a full adult premium is payable, the full adult ceiling for tax relief of &euro;1,000 has always been available and this will continue to be the case.  It should be further noted that the maximum tax relief is available at the rate of 20% of the premium payable or &euro;200, whichever is lower.  Thus, where a reduced premium is being availed of, the full adult ceiling for relief may not be employed depending on the premium price.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners tentatively estimate that the cost of extending the full &euro;1,000 adult ceiling for private medical insurance tax relief to all persons aged 21 or over, would be approximately &euro;1 million. </p>  <p>  This provisional estimate is based on returns to Revenue for the year 2013 (the most recent year for which data is available) and does not take account of any changes in the level of medical insurance coverage or premium rates in the interim.</p></reply>

The Register was populated using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases and various other Government and non-Government sources.  These various data sets were cross-checked by Revenue to ensure the accuracy of the information in respect of each property being included on the Register.</p>  <p>  However, given the scale of the project it was inevitable that there would be some errors and in a relatively small number of instances, properties were either duplicated or omitted from the Register.  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue communicated extensively in regard to this possibility and the onus was clearly placed on property owners to confirm the correct details where the information on the Register was inaccurate. </p>  <p>  On foot of the correspondence received from the person on 27 February, direct contact was made with him by the LPT team and the Register was corrected in respect of the property.  During the course of the direct contact it emerged that the person had also not filed an LPT Return or made any payment in respect of his current principal private residence.  The LPT team member assisted the person in completing an LPT Return for his property and also advised him on the various options available to him in respect of the outstanding liability taking account of his individual circumstances.</p></reply>

This is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse.  Any delay in the collection of tax that is properly due adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses.  </p>  <p>  Revenue assures me that its strong preference is to work with viable businesses or taxpayers suffering temporary cashflow difficulties to agree a mutually acceptable solution rather than deploying debt collection/enforcement options.  Revenues commitment in this regard is clearly evidenced by the fact that it granted almost 9,000 phased payment arrangements in respect of over &euro;120m of debt during 2014 rather than using debt collection/enforcement action to secure the liabilities.  </p>  <p>  Where debt collection/enforcement action becomes necessary to secure an outstanding debt, the Revenue caseworker firstly writes to the defaulting business or taxpayer demanding that the liability be paid within a specified timeframe, which is normally seven days.  The  final demand letter also clearly warns that the consequence of continued non-compliance is referral of the debt to enforcement.  Revenues first line debt collection/enforcement options for the majority of cases are Sheriff and Solicitor action and when a case is referred, responsibility for any future negotiation is delegated to the collection agent.  </p>  <p>  Once a case is referred for debt collection/enforcement, the Sheriff or Solicitor writes to the taxpayer or business offering a final opportunity to agree a mutually acceptable solution.  Where no solution can be agreed, the Sheriff or Solicitor then seeks to collect the outstanding amounts, including costs, in accordance with the various legal powers available to them. </p>  <p>  Solicitor (Court) action is used to secure judgment against a defaulting business or taxpayer.  The judgment, which confirms the debt before the Courts, can be made public and can also be used by Revenue to place judgment mortgages against any property (owned by the business or taxpayer) to the value of the outstanding debt.  Judgments are also used as part of the proceedings associated with Bankruptcy, Forced Sale of property and committal to prison, though Revenue only applies such sanctions in the most egregious or intransigent cases. In all cases where judgment is sought, the business or taxpayer is notified by way of Court summons.  </p>  <p>  Finally in regard to notification of judgment mortgages, Revenue has confirmed to me that it is the responsibility of the Property Registration Authority to inform the business or taxpayer that such a charge has been put in place.</p></reply>

I understand that the Deputy is particularly interested in the latter issue.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 reduced the annual imputed ARF distribution rate from 5% to 4% for ARF owners in the age group 60 to 70 years whose ARFs have assets of &euro;2 million or under.  This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs (or vested PRSAs).</p>  <p>  As regards the changes to AMRF access, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements (the so-called  ARF option), where an individual in a Defined Contribution pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum set aside amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with the &euro;63,500.</p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owners discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements).</p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension nest-egg to provide for the latter years of his/her retirement.  Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation.  While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.</p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF.  This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.</p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years.  In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.</p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75.  This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.</p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a draw down of a lesser value than will now be permitted.  I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it.</p></reply>

The EFSF Framework Agreement sets out the governance arrangements for the EFSF.  This provides for a Board of Governors made up of the Finance Ministers of EFSF Member States, and a Board of Directors made up of senior Finance Ministry officials of the EFSF Member States.</p>  <p>  Article 10(5)(d) of the consolidated EFSF Framework Agreement provides that the Board of Directors, by  unanimous decision, may agree any modification to the availability period of any outstanding Financial Assistance (as well as modifications to the aggregate principal amount, repayment profile or interest rate).</p>  <p>  On 20 February 2015, the Eurogroup noted a request from the Greek authorities for an extension of the second programme in order to allow the successful completion of the fifth review.  The Greek authorities agreed to present a first list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, by 23 February, which they have done.   </p>  <p>  The Institutions (the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF) have provided their first view on the list of reform measures and stated that the list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review.  The measures will need to be further specified and then agreed with the Institutions by the end of April.  On this basis, the Eurogroup on 24 February 2015 agreed in principle to proceed with the national approval procedures in order to extend the current programme by up to four months.</p>  <p>  The resultant Third Amendment to the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement with Greece (MFFA) gives effect to the Eurogroup statement of 20 February 2015 by addressing two main aspects of the decision:</p>  <p>  - Extending the Availability Period of the Loan Facility under the MFFA for a further 4 months to the end of June 2015. </p>  <p>  - The return of the EFSF funds held by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), and making those funds available for the duration of the MFFA extension for bank recapitalisation and resolution costs. </p>  <p>  The Amendment Agreement also includes some other administrative changes to the MFFA, as well as consequential changes required to implement the two aspects above.  This amendment is being agreed on the basis of proposals presented by Greece, and the agreement in principle to the extension, indicated by me at Eurogroup, was in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Agreement as approved by the Oireachtas in the legislation already referenced.

In the National Accounts, monthly trade exports are adjusted for contract manufacturing and for other methodological and data purposes.  However, these contract manufacturing activities also result in greater imports of services, in particular royalty imports (related to the use of intellectual property associated with the finished products) and the manufacturing services supplied by the contract manufacturer.  In arriving at estimates of GDP it is necessary to subtract these service imports and other costs from the value of exports.  The result shows that the overall impact on Ireland's GDP of these activities is not a significant factor in explaining the recent improvement in economic performance in this country.</p></reply>

Based on the details supplied by you, it would appear that the couple concerned have benefitted by approximately &euro;13 per week from the Budget tax measures. The Deputy will be aware that a cap of &euro;14 per week was implemented as part of the Budget package to ensure that those with incomes in excess of &euro;70,000 did not benefit more than those with incomes at that level.  However, when increases in the level of Child Benefit introduced in the Budget are taken into account, the couple concerned are benefitting by around &euro;15 per week. </p>  <p>  The Government targeted its Budget package at the "squeezed middle", i.e. those earning between &euro;32,000 and &euro;70,000 per annum.  While I am sympathetic to all those facing financial difficulties, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that over 87% of tax cases will have income of &euro;70,000 or less in 2015.  Therefore, it would be difficult to categorise households which have income in excess of &euro;70,000 as being in a "middle income" bracket. </p>  <p>  All married one-earner couples with sufficient income are benefitting from the increase in the standard rate band by &euro;1,000 from &euro;41,800 to &euro;42,800 in Budget 2015.  These couples also benefit from the cuts to the higher rate of income tax in the Budget, and from a reduction in USC if their income is under &euro;87,500.  The reason married one earners don't benefit as much from the income tax cuts, as a single individual or a married two-earner couple, is because they already pay much less income tax because of the transferable standard rate band.  For example, a married one earner on &euro;55,000 who has children will pay 55% less income tax than a single individual on the same income, in 2015. </p>  <p>  The system of individualisation, which has been in the tax code since 1999, is now integral to the tax system.  When first announced, the stated purpose of individualisation was essentially, to ease the burden on single persons (65% of the work force), to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  At the same time, a home carer allowance was introduced to compensate those who chose to stay at home to care for children rather than participate in the labour market.</p>  <p>  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system, with the standard rate band partially transferable between spouses, &euro;9,000 being the gap between the single and married one-earner bands.</p>  <p>  To complete or to reverse individualisation would cost in the region of &euro;800 million.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that no change be made to the current system. It concluded that the current system represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that that reversal of individualisation would see a second spouse entering the workforce, being liable to the marginal rate of tax on the first euro of income. This would act as a significant disincentive for those affected spouses who wish to return to work.</p></reply>

Customers in arrears will be reviewed for eligibility based on affordability, their willingness to prioritise their mortgage payments and engage with the bank.  The bank offers a Mortgage to Rent solution to the customer if they are deemed eligible. </p>  <p>  From a general policy perspective, the approach of the Government is to support people in genuine mortgage arrears and where feasible to put in place a sustainable restructure to address and resolve such a difficultly.  This is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears where it requires a lender in respect of a cooperating borrower to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender and that a lender must document its consideration of each option examined and the reasons why the options offered/not offered to the borrower are/are not appropriate and sustainable.</p>  <p>  If a solution cannot be agreed between borrower and lender, or if it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, there are alternative mechanisms available to allow a debtor remain in the house in appropriate cases.  For example, the Mortgage to Rent scheme is available in cases where the house and household would be appropriate and eligible for social housing.  Where the borrower and lender cannot agree on a sustainable mortgage restructure, the debtor has the option to formulate and propose a PIA to his/her secured and other creditor(s).  This initiative rests solely with the debtor and, in formulating a PIA, a personal insolvency practitioner is under an onus, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to formulate the proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy a principal private residence.</p></reply>

The Commissioners currently lease two adjoining buildings in Ballybay which are not considered appropriate for the Department's existing business processes or future operational requirements.</p>  <p>  The Commissioners have investigated other options in Ballybay and have inspected a number of properties, including those referred to by the Deputy, with a view to potentially adapting a building to meet the Department of Social Protection's requirements.  Significant investment would be required to bring the proposed properties up to modern standards which would not be financially sustainable based on prevailing rental levels.</p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Social Protection has decided to move the current facilities to premises in Monaghan town that will fully meet the Department's accommodation brief.

A total sum of &euro;662,000 was allocated to DCC under the Government Decision. The local authorities submitted to the Office of Public Works (OPW) programmes of repair works setting out how they intended to spend their allocations. DCC's programme of works did include for works at Maghery Strand. Funding for works at this location was not approved however, as, on the basis of the information provided, the proposed works did not meet the criteria of reinstatement of existing built coastal defence infrastructure. It is for DCC to resubmit application which meets criteria. The programme of works did not include works at Buncronan, Mountcharles and as a result there is no specific provision for works at Buncronan in the total sum of &euro;662,000 allocated to DCC under the Government Decision.  As it was not included in DCC's programme any proposals for works in that location must be considered outside of the Government Decision.</p><p>The OPW operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This administrative Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial are published on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie</i>. It is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets. A Local Authority may apply to the OPW for support under the scheme having regard to those eligibility criteria.  Application forms are available on OPW's website under Flood Risk Management and decisions are made having regard to the overall availability of funding for flood risk management.</p></reply>

The alternative approach of providing more limited access to sick pay over a shorter time frame, is often more restrictive. </p>  <p>  The application of a four-year look back was agreed by the Labour Court and reflects the practice that previously existed in the majority of the Public Service.  A key rationale for maintaining this provision was that otherwise the introduction of the new Scheme would result in an employee's four-year sick leave record being cleared.  Allowing public servants who had exhausted their access to paid sick leave under previous sick leave arrangements to have access to the full allowance of paid sick leave under the new Scheme would have undermined a fundamental purpose of the new Sick Leave Scheme, which was to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave, and on that basis was rejected by the Labour Court.</p></reply>

The reduced rates of pay for new entrants to the public service in general, and to the Education Sector specifically, were one of a number of measures introduced over the period since the fiscal crisis began which directly affected the pay of staff.  The reductions in starting pay were introduced as part of the National Recovery Plan in order to reduce the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill. Negotiations in the Haddington Road Agreement subsequently provided for an agreed process for the amalgamation of pay scales to address the imbalance between those who entered the public service as new entrants after January 2011 and those who became public servants before January 2011.  This measure represents a significant redressing of the imbalance particularly in the context of the savings required under the Haddington Road Agreement.</p></reply>

For internationally trading enterprises that are price takers productivity and wage relativities with those in competing countries will impact the pay levels that can be sustained.  Where productivity gains support higher pay there is evidence that a virtuous circle may result whereby employees are motivated to work harder, more capable and productive workers are attracted, fewer leave thereby reducing the costs of hiring and training new workers, quality and customer service may be enhanced, disciplinary problems and absenteeism may reduce as higher pay is associated with better health.</p>  <p>  As the National Competitiveness Council have pointed out, the skills of the workforce are a primary driver of productivity and long-term competitiveness as is investment in innovation.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial relations issues lies ultimately with employers and workers and their respective representatives as appropriate.  However, the industrial relations bodies of the State remain available to assist parties if requested.</p><p>Ireland has a robust body of employment law, which provides comprehensive protections for employees.  Irish law in the area of &ldquo;transfer of undertakings&rdquo; (commonly referred to as TUPE) is the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003,<i></i>S.I. No. 131 of 2003.  The Regulations implement the mandatory provisions of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 which is aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer (including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger.  In addition, section 21 of the <i>Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006</i>transposed a further provision of the EU Transfer of Undertakings Directive relating to the information to be provided by the original employer to the new employer.</p><p>The 2003 Regulations provide that all the rights and obligations of an employer arising from a contract of employment (including terms inserted by collective agreements) other than pension rights, existing on the date of a transfer, are transferred to the new employer on the transfer of the business or part thereof.</p><p>In accordance with the Transfer of Undertaking Regulations, it would be a matter for a Rights Commissioner to determine in law if any particular case does, in fact, constitute a transfer of undertakings situation.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service provides information on employees&rsquo; rights and how to obtain redress if an employee considers that their employment rights may have been infringed.  It can be contacted at Lo-call:1890 80 80 90 or via its website .  The Single Complaint Form for submitting complaints regarding breaches of employment rights is also available at .</p></reply>

The Act provides that a commercial practice, such as advertising or marketing, is misleading if it includes the provision of false information in relation to a wide range of matters relating to the trader and his or her goods or services, and if that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.  A trader who engages in such a misleading commercial practice commits an offence.  A commercial practice may also be misleading if the trader omits or conceals information necessary for an informed consumer decision and if that omission or concealment would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.</p>  <p>  An advertiser who publishes an advertisement which contravenes the Act does not commit an offence, however, if the advertiser proves that he or she did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that its publication would be in contravention of the Act.  In order to assist enforcement of the Act&rsquo;s provisions on misleading advertising, an advertiser who accepts or agrees to publish an advertisement is required to make a record of the name and address of a trader who places an advertisement, and to keep that record for not less than two years from the date of its publication.</p>  <p>  Advertisements in print and other media that are directed at businesses are regulated by the European Communities (Misleading and Comparative Marketing Communications) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 774 of 2007) which give effect to Directive 2006/114/EC on Misleading and Comparative advertising.  The Regulations provide that a marketing communication is misleading if, in any way (including its presentation), it deceives or is likely to deceive in relation to any matter specified in the Regulations the trader to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches, and by reason of its deceptive nature, it is likely to affect the trader's economic behaviour or to injure or be likely to injure a competitor.</p>  <p>  In addition to these legislative provisions, advertisements in print and other media come within the system of self-regulation established and administered by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.  The Authority&rsquo;s Code of Standards for Advertising, Promotional and Direct Marketing requires advertising and other marketing communications to be 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'.  Members of the Authority are required to abide by the Code and not to publish an advertisement that contravenes it.</p></reply>

Until the EU Commission formally issues any such proposal, and the details are known, it would be premature for me to comment at this early stage.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the <i>Programme for Government</i>contains a commitment to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector and this will be met by way of enabling powers to regulate certain practices in the grocery good sector.  These powers are contained in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014. On 22 December 2014, I issued a set of draft regulations for public consultation with a deadline for submissions of the end of February 2015.  My Department is currently examining these submissions before the final version of the regulations is promulgated and the regulations are signed into law (as soon as practicable) during 2015.</p><p>The new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will have responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of these regulations.</p><p>These national Irish regulations will go much further than the EU voluntary supply chain initiative which has been in operation since September 2014.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, I have consistently emphasised that it is important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that the introduction of any regulations does not, and cannot, guarantee anything in relation to the prices received by any given link in the supply chain.  Negotiations on price will remain an issue between the contracting parties as happens in any commercial relationship.  What the new regulations will be intended to achieve is to regulate certain practices, not set prices.</p></reply>

In January 2014, Orders were signed to effect recommendations of the Labour Court Review of the Joint Labour Committee System (JLC), including that relating to the continuation of a JLC in the Security Sector.  Subsequently the Labour Court appointed members to that JLC.  Before the members were appointed, the Labour Court consulted with IBEC, ICTU and the two employer bodies most associated with the security sector &ndash; the National Union of Security Employers (NUSE) and the Irish Security Industry Association (ISIA) who all nominated representatives for membership of the JLC.  Having considered the names put forward by those organisations the current members of the JLC were appointed on 12 May 2014.<table><tr><th>Employer Representatives</th><th>Nominated by</th></tr><tr><td>Bill Brown</td><td>NUSE</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Doyle</td><td>NUSE</td></tr><tr><td>Noel Fitzpatrick</td><td>NUSE</td></tr><tr><td>Alan Durnan  </td><td>ISIA</td></tr><tr><td>John O&rsquo;Donoghue</td><td>ISIA</td></tr><tr><td>Jim Dolan</td><td>ISIA</td></tr><tr><td>Employee Representatives</td><td>Nominated by</td></tr><tr><td>Gary Smith</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Ed Kenny</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Peadar Nolan</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Ian Black</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Tony Prior</td><td>ICTU</td></tr><tr><td>Christy Waters  </td><td>ICTU</td></tr></table></p><p>The Chairperson and Independent Member (and Chairperson in the absence of the Chair) are Anna Perry and Michael Keegan respectively, who are Industrial Relations Officers with the Labour Relations Commission. </p><p>The Court, both from its own knowledge and from a review of the Annual Report of the Private Security Authority, decided on the composition of the Committee. </p><p>I understand that the employer bodies represented on the Committee employ approximately 11,500 of the 14,700 employees that work in the sector and the employee representatives on the Committee represent approximately 5,500 of those employed in the sector.  In this regard, it should be borne in mind that one of the purposes in general of the Employment Regulation Orders is to give protection to employees who are not otherwise represented.</p><p>In formulating possible proposals that might form the basis of an Order, the Security JLC is obliged to consider the criteria as set out in Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 Act as amended, in formulating the proposals, and the Committees&rsquo; consideration of these criteria is encapsulated in the Report of the Chairman which will accompany the proposals, if any, when they are submitted to the Labour Court.</p><p>Notice of the making of the proposals was published in the Legal Notices sections of three national daily newspapers, the Irish Times, Irish Independent and Examiner.  They were also published on the Workplace Relations website.  Submissions on the proposals were sought from interested parties. </p><p>If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration.  If the Court decides they should be adopted it will forward a copy of the proposals to the Minister, who, if it is considered appropriate to do so, will make an Order giving effect to them. </p><p>Representations have been received from a number of employers in the Security sector expressing concern at the proposals under consideration at the moment for an ERO governing terms and conditions of workers in that sector.  Those employers have had an opportunity to raise their concerns directly with the JLC during the consultation process.</p><p>JLCs and the Labour Court are independent of the Minister in the carrying out of their respective functions.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in a process that is governed by statute.</p></reply>

These site visits may take place at the beginning or end of the process and in some cases there are no site visits involved.  Site visits, when they do occur, involve new companies visiting a location for the first time and senior executives of existing companies.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, the IDA Ireland does not comment publicly on the success rate of such site visits.</p>  <p>  While these site visits contribute to investment approvals and the creation of jobs, there is not always a direct correlation between site visits made and jobs created in any given year.  It is important also to acknowledge the natural time lag between a decision being made to invest and that investment coming on stream.  The time lag can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.  That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company&rsquo;s operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and the recruitment and training of suitable staff.</p>  <p>  The level of investment coming on stream is best captured in the number of jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Annual Employment Survey which shows that employment in IDA Ireland Client companies in Donegal rose from 2,106 in 2011 to 2,612 in 2014 an increase of over 20%.  Indeed, the Quarterly Household Survey shows that in the past two years unemployment in the Border area, which includes Donegal, has fallen from 16.5% in Q4 2012 to 10% in Q4 2014.</p>  <p>  As a Government, we are determined to ensure that every region in the country will benefit from recovery and we recently announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs-Regional initiative which will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of each region to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The objective is that six Regional Action Plans will be launched by July, with two remaining Strategies in development at that stage.</p>  <p>  Additionally the Government will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional capital funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by IDA Ireland to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.  This programme will build on the recent investment in or by delivery of a number of advance manufacturing and office facilities by the Agency in regional locations, including Letterkenny.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.</p>  <p>  I also recently launched IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy for the 5 year period 2015 to 2019.  In that Strategy the Agency set itself a target of winning 900 investments over the 5 year period and of increasing increase the level of investments won into in each region by between 30% and 40% during the lifetime of the Strategy.</p></reply>

The areas as described, excluding established scrub and ungrazed heather will, in general terms, be eligible under the Basic Payment Scheme provided there is evidence of an agricultural activity being carried out. In reality, such areas were already eligible in Ireland under the Single Payment Scheme provided that there was a farming activity on the land and this remains the position under the Basic Payment Scheme.  The agricultural activity required must be appropriate to the type of land involved and should ensure that the area eligible for payment remains in this state.</p></reply>

This is known as<i>force majeure </i>or exceptional circumstances.  These circumstances can take into account the impact of weather conditions including damage caused by storms.  Where such cases arise, they are examined on their individual merits and where circumstances allow, my Departmental will apply<i>force majeure </i>where non-compliances are caused by factors beyond the farmer&rsquo;s control.  Where temporary damage has, for example, been caused as a result of storms, the farmers involved are given the opportunity and sufficient time to undertake any remedial works necessary to rectify the non-compliance.  Following the severe storms in early 2014, my Department made it clear to farmers that this was the position.</p><p>If the damage was permanent, the farmers will be impacted in the future as the new payment entitlements to be granted to farmers this year will be based on the number of hectares declared in 2013 or 2015, whichever is the lower.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.</p>  <p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe met the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.</p>  <p>  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. The review increased the overall proportion of fish which could be caught in the sentinel fishery from 8% to 11%. The outcome of the rebuilding plan has meant that the overall Celtic Sea herring quota has increased from a low of 6,000 tonnes in 2009 to a quota of over 13,000 tonnes for 2015.</p>  <p>  The issues which the named individual has raised in connection with this policy are complex and are currently being examined in the Department. </p></reply>

EU Regulation No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) sets out the breakdown of EU support for rural development for each Member State for the years 2014 &ndash; 2020. Ireland&rsquo;s total EAFRD allocation for rural development is some &euro;2.19 billion (or some &euro;313 million per annum), as agreed at the EU Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) negotiations in 2013. EU funding amounts are combined with national co-funding to provide for each Member State&rsquo;s RDP. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, National Exchequer funding brings the total to be spent on RDP schemes in the 2014-2020 period to some &euro;4 billion.</p>  <p>  The MFF is subject to a formal amendment process at EU level for RDPs   approved in 2015. However, the average amount of EU support per annum remains the same.

I especially noted the statement therein, to which the Deputy refers, that employment in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries dropped by 10,900 or 9.3% since Q4 2013. I would caution, however, that these figures should be viewed in the context of the following caveat provided by the CSO, the first paragraph of which is included in the release itself:</p>  <p>  After each Census of Population the sample of households for the QNHS is updated to ensure the sample remains representative.  The new sample based on the 2011 Census of Population was introduced incrementally from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013.  This change in sample can lead to some level of variability in estimates, particularly at more detailed levels and some caution is warranted in the interpretation of trends over the period of its introduction.  The first year on year comparisons for quarters based entirely on the new sample are therefore available as of Q4 2014.</p>  <p>  However, as the QNHS is a sample survey, there is a level of variance associated with the estimates produced from the QNHS. In the case of the Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector it can be noted that the CSO estimates that the standard error measure associated with employment in this sector was 4,800 in Q4 2014 and this should be borne in mind when considering the employment levels for this sector.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the estimate for Q4 2013 was particularly high, again likely due to sampling issues, which further skews this particular year-on-year comparison.</p>  <p>  We have been in regular contact with the CSO over recent years, and will continue to be so, in an effort to gain greater insight into the figures for employment in the sector. The CSO recently indicated that they intend to revisit the data published since the 2011 Census of Population with a view to producing revised figures for this period.</p></reply>
