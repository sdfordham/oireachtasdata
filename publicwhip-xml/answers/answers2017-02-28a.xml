    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800054#WRA01000"><p>The Programme for Government commitment to phase out the USC is not something that is being proposed in isolation but rather as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan focused on supporting economic growth.  Tax revenues have grown by over 40% from &euro;34 billion in 2011 to &euro;48 billion in 2016.  It is true that new taxes have been introduced but much of the increased revenue is driven by stronger growth and tax buoyancy.  I have said on many occasions that I am cognisant of the high marginal income tax rates that apply to many people.  We should be proud to have a highly progressive income tax system, but we must also appreciate the value of retaining the incentive to work, to enable those who work hard to provide for their families and generate further economic growth through increased employment and expenditure in the domestic economy.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a small economy open to trade, open to the exchange of ideas and open to the movement of people.  In order to provide the best opportunities for our citizens we must strive to make Ireland a fair and attractive place for people to live, to work and to build their futures.  It is my view that this requires fairness at both ends of the income spectrum reducing the tax burden on lower incomes while also having a top rate of tax that is internationally competitive.</p>  <p>  The steady progress I have made in reducing the USC in the last three Budgets, allied to the many other factors at work in rebuilding our economy, is bearing fruit.  When I took office in 2011 the unemployment rate was over 14% and went on to peak at 15.2%. It is now 6.6%.  This is the 17th successive quarter of employment growth and more than 200,000 net jobs have been created since 2011.  Employment levels have increased in all regions of Ireland and we've had net inward migration for the past year or so people are coming home.</p>  <p>  With regard to the feasibility of USC abolition, the forecasts contained in Budget 2017 set out the indicative net fiscal space over the 2018 to 2021 period of some &euro;9.3 billion in cumulative terms.  Abolition of the USC over this period would absorb approximately 40% of the currently available net fiscal space.  Furthermore it is my view that the resulting reductions in marginal tax rates would support job creation and economic growth, and better enable us to address the challenges and opportunities arising in the global economy.</p></reply>

Real GDP growth of 3.5% was projected for this year while growth is forecast to average % over the period 2018-2021.</p><p>The dataflow since the Budget has been encouraging indicating that the strong momentum has continued:</p><p>-  The economy expanded by 6.9% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2016.</p><p>-  Exports are holding up well. Service exports have been particularly strong recording double-digit growth, year-on-year, in the third quarter.</p><p>-  Employment in the fourth quarter of 2016 grew by 3.3% on an annual basis - an increase of over 65,000 jobs. </p><p>-  Data for 2017 is likewise encouraging with the unemployment rate for January falling to 6.8%, down from 8.6% a year earlier.</p><p>On this basis, the economy remains on course for continued strong growth this year.</p><p>However, we do face considerable economic challenges, notably Brexit, the change in policy direction by the new US administration, and growing uncertainty in the global economy.  This was explicitly recognised in the economic outlook published with the Budget, which detailed risks to the outlook and noted that these are firmly tilted to the downside.  </p><p>Budget 2017 introduced a number of measures aimed at making Ireland Brexit ready, including a number of measures to assist exposed sectors.  Regarding investment, a new 10-year National Capital Plan will be put in place.  In addition, as part of the recently launched Action Plan for Jobs 2017, there's additional funding for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to help Irish business export more and to attract new investment.  </p><p>In conclusion I should emphasise that the best way to deal with the challenges we face, and to support continued growth is through continuation of the competitiveness oriented policies along with prudent management of the public finances that has worked so well. That is what this Government will continue to do.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800054#WRA02200"><p>The Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Minister of State Eoghan Murphy, was established to examine the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and to identify what measures could be introduced to help deter further increases for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was on rising motor insurance premiums and in this regard the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published on January 10 2017.  The Report contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions including actions to:</p>  <p>  -  address the lack of transparency in the claims environment, through the establishment of a national claims information database which will be located in the Central Bank;</p>  <p>  -  provide enhanced guidance in how to determine compensation for personal injuries claims, through the establishment of a Personal Injuries Commission;</p>  <p>  -  address the increasing level of uninsured driving, through the establishment of a fully functioning database which will allow the Garda&iacute; to check insurance compliance through the use of technology such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition; and</p>  <p>  -  address the issue of suspected fraud, through the establishment of a database that will be funded by industry but held by an independent body and that will take into account data protection concerns.</p>  <p>  Work on the implementation of these recommendations has already commenced and I am confident that the 71 actions will be implemented by the end of 2018, with 45 due for completion this year. </p>  <p>  While there is no simple solution to reduce the cost of motor insurance, I believe that with cooperation and commitment between all parties, fairer premiums for consumers can be delivered without unnecessary delay.  This in turn should lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and should  help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past. It should also better facilitate new entrants to the market.  It should be noted that CSO statistics show that there was no month on month change in the cost of motor insurance between December 2016 and January 2017. </p>  <p>  As part of its second phase, the Working Group is now examining issues related to Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance including the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors.  The Working Group will continue to meet on a regular basis in 2017.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800054#WRA02500"><p>As the Deputy is aware, during the Finance Bill Committee Stage Debates in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, my colleague, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy TD, gave a commitment that betting duty would be examined as part of the Tax Strategy Group process in 2017.  I can inform you that officials in my Department are in the early stages of examining the area with a view to completing a review for inclusion in the Excise TSG Paper 2017.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) is in place since the early 1990s and is chaired by the Department of Finance with membership comprising senior officials and political advisers from a number of Civil Service Departments and Offices.  Papers on various options for tax policy changes are prepared annually for the Group by Department of Finance officials.  Papers relating to PRSI and social welfare issues are also prepared for the Group by the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  In line with the Government's commitment to Budgetary reform including greater engagement with the Oireachtas, the Tax Strategy Group papers relating to Budget 2017 were published in July 2016.  This was well in advance of Budget Day and helped to facilitate informed discussion.  Decisions in relation to the TSG for Budget 2018 have yet to be finalised but I am satisfied that the approach adopted last year worked well and I do not expect to change it significantly.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Tax Strategy Group is not a decision-making body and the papers produced are a list of options and issues.  They are only one part of an overall Budgetary and Finance Bill process which now includes the National Economic Dialogue, the Budget Oversight Committee and the provision of pre-Budget submissions and engagement with specific groups and individuals. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800054#WRA02800"><p>At meetings between myself, officials and senior representatives of the banks late last year, at which a broad range of topics were discussed, the banks commented on the current remuneration restrictions, which apply to the banks which the State had to rescue, and the potential impact these restrictions have on recruitment and retention.  In addition, there is some reference in the banks  most recent annual reports in this regard.  However, it would be unfair to characterise this as incessant lobbying.</p>  <p>  In addition to the pay restrictions that are currently in place as part of Irish Government policy, it is important to acknowledge the wider European regulatory changes to bankers  remuneration that have been implemented since the banking crisis.  This includes a number of changes to the framework that applies to bonus payments (including salaries and discretionary pension benefits) to staff of relevant institutions.  The aim of these changes is to prevent a re-emergence of the issues we have seen in the past of short-term targets being the focus of institutions due to the remuneration policies implemented for staff resulting in significant risk taking.   </p>  <p>  The Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) introduced a remuneration framework to deal with excessive risk taking which applies to individuals within a relevant entity whose professional activities have a material impact on their risk profile, known as 'material risk takers'.  These material risk takers include senior management, risk takers, staff engaged in control functions and any employee receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the framework in 2014 and enforced by the relevant competent authorities across Europe is designed to ensure the excessive risk taking culture and short term focus on targets seen prior to 2008 is not repeated. </p></reply>

The scheme is open to both those who are purchasing new builds from a developer, and those who self-build.  By restricting it to new builds and new self-build homes only, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes should encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.</p><p>Broadly, the relief takes the form of a rebate of income tax, including DIRT, paid over the previous four tax years.  The maximum possible rebate is 5% of the purchase price or valuation for a self-build up to a maximum of &euro;400,000.  There are additional conditions of the scheme that must be met, including that the property must have been purchased or built as the first-time buyer's principal private residence, and that the mortgage taken out to purchase or build the home must be a minimum of 70% of the purchase price or 70% of the value of the property in the case of a self-build.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the number of applications for the Help to Buy incentive received up to Friday 17 February 2017 was:<table><tr><th>No. of Applications</th><th>No. of Successful applications</th><th>No. of Applications Pending*</th></tr><tr><td>2,951</td><td>872</td><td>2,079</td></tr></table></p><p>Revenue is encouraging prospective applicants to file any necessary tax returns and resolve any outstanding issues before making the HTB application.</p><p>Of the 872 successful applications there have been 307 claims, with 77 claims paid and 230 pending verification.  Claims are verified by the qualifying contractor for first-time home purchases or by the solicitor for first-time self-built homes.</p><p>*Pending means that the applicants either have to file an outstanding return or address a compliance issue, the application is to be reviewed by Revenue or the applicant needs to finalise his or her application.</p></reply>

At end September 2016, 88 per cent of the total restructured PDH accounts were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.  </p>  <p>  As part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework the completion of affordability assessments is a key step.  In this regard a lender must examine each case on its individual merits and it must base its assessment on the full circumstances of the borrower, including, inter alia, the borrower's current repayment capacity.  In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable in each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements that they offer.  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.   </p>  <p>  The  CCMA is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.  It is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 and applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.  </p>  <p>  The recent Central Bank report on Mortgage Arrears, published on the Department of Finance website on 16 December 2016, found that overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process with regard to mortgage arrears on family homes.  I would therefore urge those with mortgage debt to engage with their lender by completing a standard financial statement of their income and expenditure or contact MABS for independent professional and confidential advice.</p></reply>

These were investments the State had to make during the banking crisis, and it is the Government's intention that the State will exit these investments in a measured and careful manner which ultimately recovers the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer. </p>  <p>  In relation to AIB, I have previously indicated that an IPO is the optimal route to recouping value from our investment with the earliest possible IPO window being the second quarter of 2017.  Indeed officials in my Department along with our independent financial adviser, Rothschild, have done considerable preparatory work in this regard. In December of last year, following a competitive procurement process, three firms were appointed to act as joint global co-ordinators to lead a selling syndicate in preparation for a possible IPO. These firms have been appointed for an 18 month period and additional firms will be appointed to fill out the syndicate at an appropriate future date.  The appointment of these firms as advisers does not signal any intention or obligation for us to proceed with a transaction, which will be subject to a number of factors, including favourable market conditions.  AIB is due to publish its 2016 financial results on Thursday 2 March 2017 and we will assess the market reaction.</p>  <p>  In relation to PTSB, officials in my Department continue to keep potential disposal strategies in relation to that investment under review however clearly AIB remains our immediate priority given its size.</p></reply>

The Implementation Group consists of a representative from each of the following: Irish League of Credit Unions; Credit Union Development Association; Credit Union Managers' Association; National Supervisors Forum; and the Central Bank.  The Implementation Group also has a CUAC representative and is chaired by the Department.  This broad membership will ensure participation and contribution from all credit union perspectives.</p>  <p>  The Implementation Group held its inaugural meeting on Monday 20 February 2017 and was also attended by all CUAC members.  It is intended that each CUAC recommendation will addressed separately with a view to implementation at the appropriate time.  Meetings will continue on a monthly basis with the next meeting scheduled for late March 2017.  The term of the Implementation Group is for one year which may be extended at the discretion of the Minister.  I look forward to receiving regular progress reports on the implementation of these important recommendations.</p></reply>

It does not include PDH (private dwelling home) mortgages as has been suggested in some quarters.  The portfolio is still being assembled but is expected to consist of a mix of borrowers including some who are in receivership where the property is vacant and so the disposal of the loan will facilitate the return of the property into productive use, and other borrowers who are either unsustainable or uncooperative where they are renting the property but failing to pass some or all of the rent to the bank to service their loan obligations. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware in situations where there is a tenant in place their rights are not impacted by the sales process and are ultimately protected under the relevant tenancy laws, as such a tenant will avail of the same rights irrespective of whether the loan is owned by AIB or a third party.</p></reply>

This figure was set out in the documentation that accompanied Budget 2017 last October.  </p>  <p>  This estimate is consistent with compliance with Ireland's obligations under the fiscal rules, namely the expenditure benchmark pillar of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  According to this metric, fiscal space is calculated as the potential growth rate of the economy (10-year average) less an appropriate margin which takes into account the fact that we have not yet achieved our medium term budgetary objective of a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP. </p>  <p>  The fiscal space projections in the Budget are based on a number of moving parts (GDP deflator, reference rates for potential growth, etc.) set each year by the European Commission.  In addition, the value for general government expenditure produced by the Central Statistics Office is an integral part of the calculation.  Given all these moving parts, I want to stress that the figures, as always, are work-in-progress estimates and will evolve over time.</p>  <p>  The next estimate of the net fiscal space for 2018 will be set out in the Stability Programme 2017 Update and / or the Summer Economic Statement 2017.</p>  <p>  With regard to the carryover effect of tax measures outlined in Budget 2017, these will absorb some &euro;172.5 million of the available &euro;1.2 billion net fiscal space for 2018. As detailed in the Expenditure Report 2017, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there is an estimated carryover into 2018 of approximately &euro;0.5 billion arising from certain increases in Departmental expenditure included in the Budget Estimates for 2017. </p>  <p>  I would point out that the spending review, scheduled to be carried out in advance of Budget 2018, will among other issues, consider the policy options for meeting the additional cost arising in 2018 of the Budget 2017 expenditure measures.</p></reply>

As you are aware, this review was carried out jointly by the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and was approved by Government on 19 July.  Since the publication of the report, work has commenced on the implementation of its recommendations, including amendments to the Insurance Acts.  The necessary consultations with various stakeholders, including industry are ongoing.  It is expected that a legislative proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Some of the key recommendations contained in the report are:</p>  <p>  -  That coverage of the Insurance Compensation Fund will be extended to include third party motor insurance claims in the event of a liquidation of an insurer. The level of cover from the Insurance Compensation Fund for third party motor insurance claims will be increased from 65% to 100% in line with that currently provided by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.</p>  <p>  -  The increased coverage of the Insurance Compensation Fund will be funded by a direct contribution to the Insurance Compensation Fund from the motor insurance industry.  While the Review   indicated that this would come via the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, to the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims, further discussions are ongoing with industry about options for alternative funding arrangements which would provide greater  predictability about their financial exposure.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the recommendation that the provisions contained in section 78A of the Road Traffic Act 1961, requiring insurers to supply details to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, be amended to provide greater clarity on what is meant by the term "details", was implemented by section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2016.  This Act has yet to be commenced.</p>  <p>  This report when fully implemented will provide greater certainty in relation to the operation of the insurance compensation framework and it should ensure speedier payments and a simplification of the claims procedure.</p></reply>

In simple terms, they look at an application and make a determination of what the likelihood of a claim is and price accordingly.  Their previous claims history will heavily influence their decisions in this area.  Consequently, if a company has had a significant level of claims from a particular age group, then this will be reflected in how they price such a group of people in the future. </p>  <p>  Amongst the risk factors insurers look at are the age of the driver, the age of the car and how the car is used, as well as the location of risk, driving history, vehicle details (e.g. engine size), medical conditions, etc.  Using these factors, some people will be priced at higher levels because they are considered to represent higher risks.  I do not believe that this can be described  as a discriminatory practice as it simply reflects the nature of how insurance operates.</p>  <p>  In relation to taxi drivers, for instance, their time spent on the road makes them a much higher risk for an insurance company compared with a person who drives a short distance to work every day.  This higher risk is also likely to be reflected in an insurer's claims experience, though obviously this will differ from company to company.</p>  <p>  However, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance. Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its  Report was approved by Cabinet on January 10 2017, and subsequently published. It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation.  Work on implementing these recommendations is under way.</p>  <p>  While there is no single simple solution to effect a reduction in the cost of insurance, when taken cumulatively, the implementation of these actions  can deliver fairer premiums for consumers including young persons, older persons, taxi drivers and those driving older vehicles without unnecessary delay.</p></reply>

Under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is mandated to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for the State.   As such, NAMA's dealings with its debtors, as well as the management, funding and sale of assets are all commercial decisions taken with consideration of NAMA's commercial obligations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I, as Minister for Finance, have no role in respect of NAMA's implementation of its strategy through such commercial decisions.  These are matters for the NAMA Board in accordance with its statutory independent commercial mandate.</p>  <p>  In October 2015, the NAMA Board set an objective to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 residential units by YE2020, primarily in the Greater Dublin area, on a commercial and value maximising basis.  The Deputy's question incorrectly suggests that NAMA was given this role.  NAMA was not given this role.  This is a commercial initiative that the NAMA Board has undertaken in an effort to maximise the recovery on NAMA's loans.  So when the Deputy asks me to reassess the role given to NAMA, I have no role in reassessing their residential funding programme.</p>  <p>  I also would like to clarify the terminology used in the Deputy's question.  NAMA is not planning to build houses.  NAMA's intention is to provide funding on commercial terms to its debtors and receivers to facilitate their delivery of residential units on sites securing NAMA's loans.  NAMA only intends to extend funding to NAMA debtors and receivers on commercial arm's-length terms where there is an expectation that such funding will enhance NAMA's recovery on the loan.  NAMA requires that the projected return resulting from the provision of additional funding must be the value maximising strategy for the asset and this is fully in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  NAMA's actions also must be in line with market norms so as not to create any distortion in the market.  This means NAMA will facilitate the development of only those sites that are commercially viable and where site development will deliver a better recovery than the sale of the undeveloped site and all funding will be provided on market terms.  The development locations reflect key demand and commercial viability.  In line with its commercial mandate, NAMA will continuously review the programme to ensure funding is provided only where this is the value maximising option in line with its commercial mandate.</p>  <p>  I am supportive of the NAMA Board's decision to make this very substantial contribution, on a commercial basis, to the increased supply of new homes.  In fact, my Department's Section 227 review of NAMA published in July 2014 contained a recommendation that NAMA preserve the capacity to consider such a strategy as the commercial logic of such an initiative became clear.</p>  <p>  Through this initiative, NAMA will continue to maximise its return to the Irish State and taxpayer, currently projected to be in the region of &euro;2.3 bn when it completes its work, whilst also contributing to increased housing supply.</p></reply>

The FSO was established to provide an alternative to the Courts for consumers who have unresolved disputes with a financial service provider.  Subject only to an appeal to the High Court, a Finding of the FSO in respect of a complaint is legally binding on all parties.  </p>  <p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau (FSOB) provides a dedicated information service, which handles both phone and e-mail enquiries.  This service provides assistance on how to access the FSOB's services and to initiate a complaint.  The FSO website also acts as an important point of information for service users.  </p>  <p>  In order to simplify the complaints process and to make it easier for a consumer to articulate their complaint and to have their complaints resolved through informal means, the FSO adopted a new model of Dispute Resolution in February 2016.  This new model involves considerably more interaction with the parties.  The emphasis is on utilising mediation to resolve complaints.  This is a faster and simpler method for resolving disputes and complaints.   I understand that the FSO dispute resolution team also provides information and assistance as required to ensure the consumer is well-informed and best-equipped to engage with the services being offered.  </p>  <p>  If these early interventions do not resolve the complaint, parties have the option of having it independently investigated and adjudicated by the FSO and a legally binding finding issued.  This, of necessity, is a more formal and lengthier process.  During this process, the Investigation Service usually writes to the Financial Service Provider (FSP) setting out a series of lengthy, detailed and probing questions which are based on the specific issues which the consumer has raised, but goes beyond this by also asking a series of questions about the FSP's conduct in relation to the FSO legislation and to their obligations under consumer protection legislation.  This assists the articulation of the complaint on behalf of the consumer.</p>  <p>  Because the FSO issues findings that are legally binding on the parties, it would be incompatible with fair procedures for the FSO to also provide dedicated advice and assistance to a party to a complaint.  However, I understand that the consumer can avail of guidance from the office in relation to the processes at any point in their interaction with the FSO.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.96.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800056#WRD00400"><p>The ISIF issued their Q4 Quarterly Update on Friday 17th February.  Included as part of that update was a provisional valuation of the State's investment in AIB at the end of 2016 which stood at &euro;11.3bn, down from &euro;12.25bn at year end 2015.  This represents an estimated decline in value of just under 10% during the year and can be compared against a fall of around 8% across the wider European banking sector over the same period.</p>  <p>  This desk top valuation was conducted on behalf of the ISIF and was based on the estimated financial position of the bank at year end 2016 and publicly available information.  AIB will report their annual results on Thursday 2nd March.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is an "outside in" valuation produced for accounting purposes and was not informed by management's views of the prospects and risks for the business.  This additional information would be disclosed in a published prospectus ahead of any proposed sale.  Furthermore I would also highlight that in an IPO when one is selling a large volume of shares, the market usually applies what is known as an "IPO discount" and this is typically in the order of 5%-10% and occasionally more.  Hence the price one gets on the day of flotation tends to be lower than what investors believe is the fundamental value of the business given the volume of shares being placed in one transaction and reflecting the fact that the State will also retain a significant stake in the bank which will be sold down over time.  Taking these factors into consideration I do not believe that this valuation will have any material impact on our plans in relation to AIB this year.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, any decision by the Government to proceed with a sale of our shares in AIB will be underpinned by the need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on AIB, bearing in mind its current performance, its future prospects and the outlook for the economy.  Officials in my Department continue to monitor market conditions and the performance of banking equities on an ongoing basis.  While I cannot predict what market conditions will be like for bank shares over the coming year, it is our intention to be ready to execute a transaction if conditions allow.</p></reply>

Other platforms in which ISIF is a co-investor include the Ardstone Residential Partnership and the Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund.</p>  <p>  ISIF is also examining the feasibility of establishing, in conjunction with the private sector, a Housing Investment Fund which would fund the delivery of substantial new mixed-tenure residential developments, comprising social and private housing, in a way that is both off-balance sheet and commercially viable.  Engagement with a wide array of key stakeholders is currently ongoing.</p>  <p>  ISIF is also involved in other housing-related measures, including:</p>  <p>  -  On-campus accommodation programmes of Higher Education Institution with ISIF having provided a &euro;54m long term debt facility to DCU.</p>  <p>  -  Potential provision of equity finance to operators in the build-to-rent sector.</p>  <p>  -  Financing infrastructure which enables residential development, by working with other funding sources including the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), Local Authority resources and commercial investment.  Two pilot projects currently being considered would facilitate 6,000 housing units.</p>  <p>  More broadly, my Department is engaging with NAMA around the levels and pricing of debt and equity investment to ensure financing is being provided on competitive terms.</p>  <p>  The availability of development finance alone is not sufficient to encourage development unless projects are commercially viable.  As part of Rebuilding Ireland the Government has set out a comprehensive package of measures to address structural constraints which may be inhibiting the viability of residential development.</p>  <p>  One such measure is the LIHAF, administered by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the purpose of which is to provide up to &euro;200m for local authorities who collaborate with housing providers to provide off-site infrastructure to facilitate housing developments which would otherwise not take place.  Allocations under this funding structure are expected to be announced by end-March 2017.</p></reply>

The index is kept in respect of each county and shows the folio number(s) corresponding to the name.</p>  <p>  In addition, information regarding the availability of residential zoned land is available on the Department of Housing and local authority websites and is based on a national survey of all lands zoned for residential or primarily residential development in statutory local authority development plans and local area plans across Ireland to determine the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for primarily residential development purposes.  See www.housing.gov.ie/planning/residential-land-availability/residential-land-availability-survey.</p>  <p>  The Housing Supply Taskforce for Dublin has recently collated data on the aggregated planning permissions and planning applications across the four Dublin local authorities which they have mapped and available to view on the department of Housing website at www.housing.gov.ie/housing/construction-2020-strategy/dublin-housing-supply-task-force/housing-supply-coordination-task.</p>  <p>  More generally, I would point out that Ireland would not be recovering the way it is if the Irish banks, NAMA and IBRC had not progressed their sales strategies in the manner they have done.  It has only been through the sale of these assets and the accompanying investment that these assets have recovered being developed and are contributing to our broader recovery.  When we think of unfinished housing estates, dilapidated hotels or the unfinished skeletons of commercial offices and apartments, it has only been through the investment in these assets by the buyers of the assets and related loans that they have been brought to completion.  It is as important today as it ever was that we remain open to investment capital for the development of our economy across the risk spectrum of investment opportunities.</p></reply>

We should consider and debate the contents and findings carefully before establishing the terms of reference for any such Commission of Investigation.  There may well be questions currently being suggested for a Commission of Investigation which will be adequately covered off by the PAC report.  There may also be findings supported by evidence which warrant further investigation.</p>  <p>  It is sensible that the Oireacthas will fully study and debate the PAC report when it arrives.  The agreement in principle to establish a Commission of Investigation remains.  However, we should not establish Commissions of Investigation lightly and must ensure that any Commission of Investigation has specific terms of reference supported by evidence to justify its establishment.  Commissions are expensive and time-consuming but serve an important purpose when other avenues of justice are not appropriate and when they are properly established on the basis of evidence to support their terms of reference.</p></reply>

In this regard, I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation under the details as provided by the Deputy.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.</p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation is available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The website also contains an on-line naturalisation residency calculator which individuals may find of assistance in establishing if the residency requirements are met.</p>  <p>  Following a Referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship.  As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004.  The changes came into effect on 1st January 2005.  As of that date a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been lawfully resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth.  Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.</p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years' reckonable residence in the State.  This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation.</p></reply>

Under this Decision a programme office was established in my Department to oversee the operational aspects of the programme, which aims to bring in 4,000 vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees to Ireland under two different mechanisms, refugee resettlement - operated by the Office for Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) - and asylum seeker relocation from within the EU.</p>  <p>  We will be 100% ahead of target numbers on the Resettlement Programme by next September, due to our commitment to accept an additional 520 programme refugees from Lebanon this year.  While there have been challenges at EU level to maximise the functioning of the Relocation aspect of the programme, following my visit to Greece last December, I am satisfied that the numbers coming in under relocation will scale up to agreed levels this year.  My emphasis currently is to increase the number of people arriving in Ireland under the mechanisms currently in place.  I am satisfied that we are making that progress now to ensure many more people can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes.  Our attention is focused on meeting these targets and the needs of those accepted under the programmes on arrival.  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the various offices in my Department and in other Departments and agencies.  As a result we have established functioning mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.</p>  <p>  It is essential that we continue our efforts to complete the IRPP successfully before we look to apply the learning from this Programme to deliberations with regards to any future refugee intake.  Decisions taken at EU level with regard to the ongoing migration crisis will of course impact on any such deliberations.</p></reply>

This Audit covered the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2016 and includes the statistics currently available on the Garda website (www.garda.ie) and it is anticipated that this National Audit will conclude in the second quarter of 2017.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have also assured me that no issues stem from this audit with regard to the performance of MAT checkpoints or prosecutions emanating therefrom.</p>  <p>  The Road Traffic Act 2016 (the 2016 Act) was enacted on 27 December 2016 but has not yet been commenced.  The Deputy will be aware that road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr Shane Ross, T.D.  I am, however, informed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is working with key stakeholders to introduce the new roadside tests for drugs, which will be known as preliminary drug tests.  It is intended that the provisions will be commenced at the Easter Bank Holiday weekend.  This will allow time for all stakeholders to prepare for introduction, and will provide a valuable opportunity to highlight the dangers of drug driving over the Bank Holiday weekend.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the introduction of the preliminary drug tests and am confident that these new road traffic enforcement measures will impact positively on road safety.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have no direct role in the enforcement of Road Traffic legislation, including the conduct of MAT checkpoints, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as through a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including driving while intoxicated, as well as speeding and use of a mobile phone.</p>  <p>  By working together with the Road Safety Authority and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour through public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership.  Both targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.</p>  <p>  In January, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also indicated that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore.</p></reply>

A "deemed" charity remains registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority ('Charities Regulator') for so long as this tax exemption with the Revenue Commissioners is valid.  The Regulator may remove a charity from its register if the Charity fails to carry out certain requirements of the Charities Act or by applying to the High Court.</p>  <p>  The Charities Act 2009 requires all charities to register with the Charities Regulator.  To be a charity you must operate in the State, have a charitable purpose only and provide public benefit.  Section 3 of the 2009 Act provides that charitable purposes are: the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship; the advancement of education; the advancement of religion; and any other purpose that is of benefit to the community.  A charitable purpose must be of public benefit, which means that it must be beneficial in an identifiable way to the general public or a section of the public.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Charities Regulator that, on initial view, residents&rsquo; associations may not fit these criteria as the beneficiaries may be limited to the residents of a particular area.  However, any application from a residents' association will be considered on its own merit and the Regulator will form a view on each application in its own right.  It should be noted that any decision to register an individual organisation on the statutory Register of Charities is a matter for the Charities Regulator, which under Section 14(3) of the 2009 Act is independent in the performance of its functions.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p>  <p>  The Government has an agreed overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensuring that all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service.</p>  <p>  At present there are approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.  4,000 civilians will effectively double this figure and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians over the next 5 years.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained police men and women are available for and utilised in operational areas.</p>  <p>  To support the implementation of this vision, Budget 2017 has provided funding for 800 Garda trainees, 300 Reserves and up to 500 civilians.  The recruitment and appointment of these additional civilians will facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional levels, and also to begin the phased redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing roles.  These additional resources will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has agreed that the 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach: firstly, the identification of Garda&iacute; filling roles that could be done by suitably qualified civilians of whom the Garda Inspectorate has indicated there may be in the region of 1,500, and secondly, the application of a "civilian by default" policy.  Under this policy all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, will be filled by civilian staff with the appropriate skills and expertise.  Having regard to the Policing Authority's statutory functions in relation to approving the number and grades of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and making senior appointments, I have requested the Commissioner, in conjunction with the Authority, to prepare a 5 year plan to achieve the 20% target through the rigorous application of these policies.  Work is underway on this plan and I am informed by the Authority that of the 500 civilians to be recruited this year, Garda management has indicated that some 30% will lead to redeployment opportunities which is a very welcome start on a road that has the potential to make a huge contribution to ensuring that we have an effective and efficient police service.</p>  <p>  SI 109/1990 provided that members appointed with special technical qualifications and assigned to serve in particular sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Regulation 14 of SI 164/1988 (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988) were not eligible for transfer to any other section or part of the organisation, on promotion or otherwise.  Both of these statutory instruments have been revoked by SI 485/2006 (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Promotion) Regulations 2006) and SI 470/2013 (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013) respectively.</p>  <p>  Subsequent regulations continue to provide for appointments of persons with special aptitudes, knowledge, skills or technical qualifications as members in certain circumstances without compliance with all of the normal provisions applicable to trainee Garda&iacute;.  Such appointments are rare and in the past would have included, for example, persons with ICT expertise.  Such expertise is now secured through recruiting civilian staff.  Obviously there is no intention that members appointed under any of the above regulations and who do not have the necessary training and skills for front-line policing would be redeployed.  Where appropriate, any such posts which do not require policing powers and could be filled by suitably qualified civilians will be filled in the future using the "civilian by default" policy at such a time as the posts become vacant.</p></reply>

There is a total of 23.62 solicitors, and 7.8 paralegals (full time equivalents).

A complementary service in international protection matters is provided by solicitors in private practice who have agreed to provide services on behalf of the Board.  There are currently 67 solicitors on the international protection solicitors' panel with a number of applications remaining to be processed.  The service provided by solicitors on the panel in relation to an application for international protection is the same service that would be provided by a law centre.  Law centres refer applicants to the panel having regard to their workload and other guidelines laid down by Board management from time to time.</p>  <p>  Additional staffing of 15 full time equivalents for the Legal Aid Board was approved by my Department in 2016, including clerical and legal grades.

It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women.</p><p>Mr. Justice Quirke was asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill.</p><p>The Scheme provides for lump sum payments varying from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in the institution concerned.  Further, each woman is entitled to a top-up payment to bring her weekly income from the Irish State up to the equivalent of the Irish Contributory Pension.</p><p>To date 819 applications have been received by my Department all of which have been processed.  No application was refused due to inaccurate or missing records.  However, 101 applications were refused because the applicants were not resident in a relevant institution.  </p><p>If there is a discrepancy, or in cases where the religious congregations have an incomplete or no record for an applicant, my officials carry out a thorough examination, checking whatever records are available from other departments, agencies and institutions to support the application.  The records of the religious congregations are not regarded as decisive; they are just one factor that is taken into consideration.  Interviews were conducted with 70 applicants for whom the religious congregations concerned did not have records and of those 70 applicants, 2  were refused entry to the scheme.</p><p>Over &euro;25 million has been paid out to 669 women under the Scheme, of whom 118 qualified for the maximum lump sum payable under the scheme.  In addition there are a further 17 applicants who also qualify for the maximum payment but have not yet been paid.  Of these 17 applicants, 9 are deemed to lack  capacity but will be paid following the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making legislation.  The remaining 8 applicants who qualified for the maximum payment are deceased and payments will issue to their estate once a Grant of Probate issues.  The Deputy will be aware that Judge Quirke recommended that where an applicant was deceased before a payment issued that the maximum amount payable to her estate should be &euro;50,000.  </p><p>Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking into account any available records, documents and statements including the applicant's testimony.  Processing of all applications under the Scheme operates on the premise that the testimony of the applicant is correct and the officers processing the application then seek to verify the application by checking appropriate records.  If there are records and they are consistent with the application, then an offer is made.  It should be noted that the majority of applicants who were resident in the 10 Magdalen institutions fall into this category. </p><p>In relation to the question concerning applicants accepting lesser awards than were claimed, it should be noted that the award is determined solely by the proven length of time spent in the institution concerned.  In some instances an applicant may believe that they spent a longer period of time in an institution than the available records support.  Usually, when an applicant is shown all the available records, which include religious, primary school, employment records and and so on, they are satisfied, given the lapse of time involved, that the available records provide a more accurate account of the length of stay in the institution.  The exact number of applications that category is unavailable but I am informed that the number is not significant.</p></reply>

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in a number of provincial court offices. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that while a staff member in the Courts Service office in Castlebar has recently retired, local management were aware of the pending retirement and another staff member has been trained in the processing of probate applications in that District Probate Registry.  The examination of probate applications requires a thorough legal examination of documents and it takes a new staff member a period of at least six months to acquire a satisfactory knowledge in this area. However, the staff member will be available shortly to commence processing applications and every effort will be made to minimise any delays in the interim. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that backlogs in the probate system are a cause for concern and a review of the probate system is being carried out at present.  It is anticipated that a report with recommendations for the modernisation of the process will be presented by mid 2017 to the Senior Management Team of the Courts Service and to the Courts Service Board for their consideration.</p></reply>

As Counsel pointed out the appropriate forum for raising matters related to alleged Garda failings was the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) who were already investigating certain matters arising from the tragic death in this case.  This arises in part from the fact that my predecessor had referred aspects of this particular case to GSOC.  I understand that that investigation has not concluded.  I should also mention that a civil action has been initiated against the State in respect of issues raised in the complaint.</p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach and I recently met with the family, the Taoiseach assured them that when the GSOC investigation is completed the question of whether, and if so, what further action can be taken, will be considered.

As the Deputy will be aware, the allocation of judicial resources and the scheduling of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the judiciary who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The President of the Circuit Court has been very helpful as regards consideration of dedicated new court arrangements for repossessions and the option and implications of the use of pre-existing legislative powers to implement a system of specific court sittings  for repossessions at specific venues on specific dates.  This is being pursued at present between my Department and the Courts with a view to possible new arrangements for the Easter law term where appropriate and having regard to constitutional constraints. </p>  <p>  Furthermore the Government, at its meeting of 6 December 2016, decided to reassign, by appointment, three specialist judges of the Circuit Court as ordinary judges of the Circuit Court to fill three existing vacancies and so there are currently no vacancies in the Circuit Court.  The Department is actively involved in discussions, including with the judiciary and Courts Service, as regards what progress can be made on introducing the proposed dedicated arrangements for mortgage arrears cases which I hope to bring to Government for consideration in the near future.</p>  <p>  A key element of the commitments in the Programme for Government is, as the Deputy will also be aware, putting in place a national mortgage arrears resolution service and priority was given last year to getting the new national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (Abhaile) up and running.  The service, which forms part of the Programme for Partnership Government commitments on mortgage arrears, ensures that people who are at risk of losing their home have access to free independent financial and legal advice and assistance.  The objective is to help these homeowners to identify and put in place solutions to their mortgage arrears, with priority to helping them remain in their home wherever possible. </p>  <p>  On 27 February 2017 a new national information campaign went live, designed to reach out to homeowners in mortgage arrears and further raise awareness of the highly effective Abhaile service.  This information campaign wants to ensure that everyone who needs assistance and may be at risk of losing their home is aware that free advice and support is available through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) helpline and MABS offices across the country.  Homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears, including those facing repossession proceedings, can contact MABS which will provide support and advice.  Support available includes in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate with financial institutions on the borrower's behalf. </p>  <p>  MABS can also provide access to free independent financial advice and assistance on personal insolvency and bankruptcy from a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP), and to free independent legal advice from a solicitor, under a 'voucher' system.  The advice and assistance is provided by a PIP or solicitor from expert panels, established under the Scheme respectively by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and by the Legal Aid Board.  The service also includes free support and assistance at Circuit Court repossession court lists country-wide, with MABS court mentors in attendance to provide help and advice to borrowers attending, and a 'duty solicitor', from a Legal Aid Board panel, to provide legal assistance in court to unrepresented borrowers in repossession proceedings.  The scheme also offers legal aid to borrowers seeking the new Personal Insolvency court review under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.  To date some 4,800 individual vouchers have been provided under under Abhaile for free financial or legal advice and assistance on home mortgage arrears since 22 July 2016. </p>  <p>  A further key element relates to the power of a court to impose mortgage arrears solutions for those in arrears and it is critical to note that use of the key statutory provision allowing for imposition of debt solutions involving a mortgage, where the solution has been rejected by the creditors, is increasing due to the availability of the Abhaile service since last October.  I am referring to the "section 115A" procedure put in place under the 2015 Personal Insolvency legislation which allows the Circuit Court, in defined circumstances, to impose a personal insolvency arrangement (PIA), on application from the debtor, where the proposed arrangement has been rejected by the creditors.   </p>  <p>  I would also like to point out to the Deputy that early indications, while based on small initial samples, suggest that the new Abhaile service is reaching those most at risk of losing their homes, and particularly the cohort of those who are in mortgage arrears equivalent to 720 days or more.  They also suggest that access to free, independent expert help, and to statutory protection against creditor pressure for those who are engaging, is a significant relief for those at risk, and that independent advice is identifying solutions which offer better outcomes for the homeowner, often enabling them to remain in their homes.  Representative outcome data for the Abhaile Service is not yet available, but this information is being tracked and collected and full analysis will be available at a later date.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Social Protection, leads both operational oversight and governance steering groups for the new Abhaile service and its effectiveness and impacts are being closely monitored as part of these processes.  Furthermore, my Department continues to pursue the remaining aspects of the Programme for Government commitment, including the identification of any necessary legislation, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, bearing in mind constitutional and legal aspects, with a view to further implementation measures in the coming months.</p></reply>

The objective of this review was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.  </p>  <p>  As a result, the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was implemented in 2012 and 2013.  This was reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Policing Plans for 2012 and 2013 which set out the details of the closure of 39 Garda stations in 2012 and 100 Garda stations in 2013 and the amalgamation of 28 Garda districts to fourteen 14 enlarged Garda districts.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Authorities that Garda Stations which were closed under the Programme were returned to the control of the Office of Public Works and that the future use of those properties is now a matter for that Office.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that any costs associated with re-opening the properties as functioning Garda Stations would have to be determined by the Office of Public Works following a full technical examination of each property to assess the works required to render the property fully compliant with building regulations and fit for purpose to operate as a Garda Station.  In addition, the Garda Authorities would, of course, need to examine the staffing and operational implications of deploying Garda&iacute; to the stations during public office hours, thus diverting Garda&iacute; from front-line duties in the community.  </p></reply>

In this regard I am advised that psychiatric reports may be provided for the courts regarding issues such as fitness to be tried, the presence or otherwise of mental illness, and treatment arrangements in the event of the imposition of a custodial or non-custodial sanction.  Such reports can, in particular, aid the courts in diverting people with mental illness away from prison by ensuring that such persons can access appropriate treatment following the imposition of a non-custodial sanction.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the great majority of these diversions (about 80%) involve voluntary attendance at non-hospital settings, such as out-patient treatment settings.</p>  <p>  In these voluntary cases, the court adjourns to allow the person to access such treatment and bail may be granted on this basis.  In other cases, a person may be sent to a local approved centre for assessment and possible admission.  In such cases, the person may be granted bail or given a non-custodial sanction by the court in order that they may access mental health care in an approved centre.</p>  <p>  In relation to young offenders, I understand that a Bail Supervision Scheme has been introduced and this initiative operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

The Committee oversaw the development of a Sentencing Information website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  I very much support this initiative which is supported administratively and funded by the Courts Service from the Courts Vote. The Courts Service has informed me that the total expenditure to date exclusively on the Irish sentencing project is &euro;397,060.  This figure includes fees for legal/professional services to the project and expenditure on some ICT support and development.  However, further ICT support costs have been incurred but it is not possible to quantify these as they are contained within the total ICT support costs for all Lotus Notes Applications, of which this project is one. </p>  <p>  Additionally the Courts Service through its ICT Unit also supported the development of a computer system for the storage of the sentencing data collected and a website which can be accessed by members of the judiciary and the public.  The website is a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers, those concerned with the needs of victims and their families as well as members of the public.</p>  <p>  Over a period from 2005 to 2009 funding from the Courts Service provided resources for the work of the Committee and enabled the project to retain the services of 9 practising barristers to collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes in a sample number of criminal cases over a defined period of time.  When funding from the Courts Service was reduced, the project availed of the services of five interns through the Government JobBridge scheme.  The Courts Service has also informed me that currently there are no full time resources working on this project.</p>  <p>  I should inform the Deputy that we are currently examining the feasibility of bringing  the sentencing information function within the statutory remit of the proposed Judicial Council, the Bill in respect of which is at an advanced stage of drafting. </p></reply>

This commitment follows on from the recommendation of the Penal Policy Review Group that a programme similar to the existing Diversion Programme for persons under eighteen years of age, be introduced for young people above the age of eighteen years, with an initial focus on eighteen to twenty one year olds.  The Review Group recommended that the relevant Departments and agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should immediately consult in relation to the most appropriate and effective means of targeting this group within the context of current and future resources.</p>  <p>  The Review Group did acknowledge that a Diversion Programme for eighteen to twenty one year olds would have resource implications for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  They also recognised that a greater focus on young offenders in this age cohort "would require a level of consultation and cooperation between Departments and agencies, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, comparable to the existing Diversion Programme".  Importantly, the Review Group went on to say that "undoubtedly this would require a level of commitment in terms of resources, finances and cooperation that is undetermined".</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Irish Youth Justice Service continues to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the recommendation with a view to scoping out the detailed implications of introducing a Diversion Programme for young offenders over eighteen years of age, focusing in the first instance on offenders aged eighteen to twenty one years.  This requires a detailed analysis of the nature and scale of offending by the age cohort concerned in recent years.  This is necessary so that there is clarity in relation to the potential numbers that might be amenable to diversion should such a programme be established and operated on the same basis as the existing Programme.  It is also essential to establish the potential resource implications for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in terms of the number of additional Juvenile Liaison Officers that might be required and the additional workload that would fall to the Director of the Diversion Programme and the Garda Youth Diversion Office.  There would also be the potential implications for the Irish Youth Justice Service to be considered should that office's remit be extended, not least in terms of the management and oversight of likely additional expenditure to expand the current network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects to support the operation of a Diversion Programme for the age cohort involved.</p>  <p>  As previously indicated, consideration must also be given to the outcome of the ongoing comprehensive review of the existing Diversion Programme which is being undertaken by a Group established by the Garda Commissioner.  The outcome of that review will likely inform considerations relating to the establishment of a similar programme for young offenders over eighteen years of age.  Other considerations could include how effective such approaches are in other jurisdictions where this age cohort is concerned.  </p>  <p>The Deputy will therefore appreciate that while progress is being made in relation to the questions raised, the implications of introducing a diversion strategy for the age cohort concerned requires detailed and careful consideration so that there is full appreciation of its likely impact, both in terms of its effectiveness and on the agencies concerned.</p></reply>

As such it makes reference to children and young people experiencing transitions in a range of contexts.  These include children in transition from living at home to living in a care setting such as residential care or detention. </p>  <p>  Commitment G33 under Transformational Goal 5 is to 'Bring a stronger focus on effective transitions, particularly within education, health, child welfare and youth justice services'.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is the lead agency with responsibility for action in relation to this commitment.  The Department of Justice and Equality is also identified as having responsibility for action in relation to the commitment having regard to its responsibilities in the youth justice area.  The Department's role in this regard could arise in circumstances where children and young people are being released from detention in the Children Detention Campus in Oberstown and who become subject to Probation Service supervision after their release.  It could also arise in circumstances where young people are transferred from the Oberstown Campus to the Irish Prison Service upon reaching their eighteenth birthday during the course of a custodial sentence in Oberstown.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that the Probation Service and Oberstown Children Detention Campus have an agreed protocol on working together.  This protocol promotes coordinated collaborative practices between the Probation Service and Oberstown.  It provides guidance on joint working with children and young people entering detention, in detention and preparing for discharge, including periods of early discharge.  Similarly, the Irish Prison Service and Oberstown have developed a protocol which addresses information sharing and promotes co-ordinated and collaborative practices between both parties in the context of transfers of young people detained in Oberstown to the Irish Prison Service as referred to above. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the role of the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to Transformational Goal 5, is reflected well in the collaborative approaches and practices of the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service in their dealings with the Oberstown Children Detention Campus where children and young people transitioning from detention to other settings is concerned.</p></reply>

It commenced in October 2011 and is now operational in every county and from every prison in the State.  The Programme has been supported by the reallocation of resources and key personnel from within both services.</p><p>The Programme targets well behaved prisoners serving sentences of between 1 and 8 years imprisonment who are making genuine efforts to desist from reoffending.  Prisoners serving sentences of less than one year are ineligible for Community Return and may instead be considered for release under the Community Support Scheme.  Persons serving sentences of over 8 years generally fall within the Parole Board process.  The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release is fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.  Each application is considered on its individual merits and in line with the legislative provisions.</p><p>A formal assessment for Community Return is undertaken when a recommendation to this effect is made following a Prisoner Review Meeting.  These meetings are chaired by the Prison Governor and other attendees include representatives from the Probation Service, Psychology, Chaplaincy, Education, addiction services, other senior prison officials and a representative from Prison Service Headquarters.  </p><p>The total number of releases on to the scheme, broken down by prison and covering the period from October 2011 until the end of 2016, are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Prison</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td></td><td>29</td><td>19</td><td>41</td><td>28</td><td>17</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Dochas</td><td></td><td>12</td><td>21</td><td>14</td><td>12</td><td>9</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>7</td><td>22</td><td>39</td><td>35</td><td>20</td><td>29</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan</td><td>11</td><td>27</td><td>79</td><td>92</td><td>75</td><td>83</td><td>367</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>5</td><td>29</td><td>33</td><td>33</td><td>17</td><td>16</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy</td><td>11</td><td>40</td><td>36</td><td>23</td><td>24</td><td>9</td><td>143</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton</td><td>18</td><td>70</td><td>82</td><td>127</td><td>87</td><td>82</td><td>466</td></tr><tr><td>St Pats</td><td></td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>7</td><td>36</td><td>18</td><td>43</td><td>27</td><td>24</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>26</td><td>25</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>66</td><td>299</td><td>396</td><td>455</td><td>323</td><td>301</td><td>1840</td></tr></table></p><p>There were an additional 415 persons who did not progress on to the scheme having been referred for assessment.

I can inform the Deputy that all committals are assessed upon arrival to prison.  This assessment process also seeks to ensure that wherever possible, prisoners are accommodated in cells appropriate to their needs.  Some prisoners are more suited to multi-occupancy cells, while others are more suited to single-cell occupancy.  It should be borne in mind that in certain cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity.  Family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell.  Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm. </p><p>It is not possible to provide the cost of ensuring each prisoner resides in single cell accommodation as requested by the Deputy as there are too many variables to be considered in terms of building costs, new build, updating existing facilities, staff cost, services for prisoners, bedding, furniture, etc.</p></reply>

On completion of the Limerick and Portlaoise projects, &ldquo;slopping out&rdquo; will be completely eliminated across the prisons estate. <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service, that the number of prisoners without access to in-cell sanitation has decreased from 1,003 at the end of 2010 to just 49 on 18 January 2017 (Portlaoise 28 and Limerick 21).</p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan sets out the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to strengthen family supports to facilitate on-going contact with prisoners while in custody and their reintegration post release, with appropriate supports and programmes. </p>  <p>  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service established the Families and Imprisonment Group, and tasked the group with examining existing visiting facilities for all prisoners and in particular to address the needs of children and families as highlighted in the report published by the Irish Penal Reform Trust titled "Picking up the Pieces: The Rights and Needs of Children and Families Affected by Imprisonment".</p>  <p>  The Families and Imprisonment Implementation Group is currently overseeing the delivery of the actions identified and is chaired by Governor Pat Dawson and includes representatives from the Childhood Development Initiative, the Psychology Service, the Probation Service, the Prison Officer's Association and Tusla.  A key goal is to establish a model of through-care to parents returning to the community in partnership with Tusla and other community based organisations.</p>  <p>  Following a period of consultation with a range of non-government organisations, the Irish Prison Service forged a partnership with the Childhood Development Initiative and the Parents Plus Charity to introduce a dedicated family and imprisonment programme on a pilot basis called 'Family Links' which commenced in Limerick Prison in September 2014 with the aim to improve the visiting experience for families, improve staff awareness of the effects of imprisonment on families, and to support the family unit with the introduction of a parenting programme. </p>  <p>  As part of this initiative, Limerick Prison has radically changed the design for visits in the C Block.  The visiting room now consists of eight round tables with four chairs around each in a warm and colourful environment.  Prisoners on standard regime have access to this style of visit.  Limerick Prison has also established a &lsquo;family room&rsquo; which is available to prisoners on an enhanced regime. </p>  <p>  Limerick Prison has worked closely with the Irish Prison Service Training College and the Childhood Development Initiative in developing and delivering a number of learning and development programmes.  Training have been delivered to over 40 staff to include: (1) 'Front-of-House' training to improve customer service, and increase awareness of the challenges faced by families with a loved one in custody; (2) Family Liaison Officer training to support the prisoners in their role as parents and to co-deliver the 'Parents Plus' parenting course to prisoners; and, (3) Children First awareness training.  </p>  <p>  The Parents Plus Charity and Childhood Development Initiative have worked with the Irish Prison Service to tailor the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme to meet the need of parents in prison.  Family Liaison Officers in Limerick Prison facilitate parenting skills course for prisoners, and &lsquo;Bedford Row&rsquo; charity works simultaneously to deliver the parenting programme in the community.  This programme has been successfully delivered to 24 prisoners. </p>  <p>  The University of Limerick was commissioned to undertake an independent evaluation of the Limerick pilot, utilising both qualitative and quantitative methods.  </p>  <p>  I had the pleasure of launching the evaluation of the  Family Links Programme on Monday 13th February, 2017 at an event in my Department.  At the launch, I stated that &ldquo;by improving and supporting family relationships, we can not only reduce tension and family conflict but very importantly, minimise the numbers of offenders returning to prison, which is to everybody&rsquo;s benefit&rdquo;.   </p>  <p>  Governor Pat Dawson who chaired the Irish Prison Service Families and Imprisonment Group stated at the launch that the Family Links Programme was implemented with the support of Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) to develop models of best practise to be implemented in Irish prisons.  </p>  <p>  The programme is currently being extended to both Midlands and Wheatfield Prisons and  includes family related courses and programmes, staff training and support, community follow-up and partnership, communications and enhanced visiting facilities.</p>  <p>  Further small capital projects are underway to enhance visit facilities across the prison estate.  Funding was awarded to St. Vincent de Paul to extend their Visitor Centre facilities to Wheatfield Prison.  The Irish Prison Service has allocated funding to appoint a Family Links Coordinator.</p></reply>

No. 680 of 2004). </p>  <p>  Temporary Release powers conferred on the Minister are significantly curtailed for certain offences subject to minimum mandatory sentences and indefinite contempt of court.  As such, the Minister does not have the legislative authority to grant temporary release for re-socialisation/reintegration, rehabilitative purposes in those cases, either directly or by delegated authority.  In such case, the only applications for temporary release that can be considered by the Minister are those for the grave reason of a humanitarian nature, and any release so granted shall be only of such limited duration as is justified by that reason.</p></reply>

In order to achieve this aim the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service have a multi-agency approach involving considerable resources devoted to offender management and rehabilitation from pre to post-imprisonment in order to support planned re-integration, reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes.  </p>  <p>  Where the Courts have ordered the post-release supervision of offenders on completion of sentence, or in the case of life-sentenced prisoners released on reviewable conditional release by the Irish Prison Service, prison-based Probation Officers complete appropriate risk assessments to inform future case management.  This case management is undertaken by Probation Officers in the community for the duration of the specified community sanction. </p>  <p>  In addition the Prison Service provide a range of services to prisoners to enhance their chance of successful reintegration. </p>  <p>  The Integrated Sentence Management process is  a prisoner centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress. </p>  <p>  A primary function of the Psychology Service in prisons is to assist offenders address factors that place them at risk of re-offending including emotional regulation, mental health, substance abuse, sexual and violent offending.  Where deemed clinically appropriate, the Psychology Service provides support to those who have been engaged with the Service who are transitioning between prison and community.     </p>  <p>  The guiding principle which underpins the Prison Education Service and the Prison Work and Training Service is to make available work, work-training, education and other purposeful activities to assist offenders cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. </p>  <p>  The Chaplaincy Service provides pastoral and spiritual care to any prisoners who wish to avail of the service.  The Irish Prison Service provides funding to the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) for two operational services, the 'Gate' Service and the Resettlement Service. </p>  <p>  The 'Gaining Access to Training and Employment' (GATE) Service is a vocational service that offers guidance counselling and placement supports to referred prisoners with the overall aim of securing a placement in training, further education or employment post-release.  The Resettlement Service is a primary needs resettlement support service for prisoners with less than 18 months left to serve.  The Resettlement Service provides one-to-one support from the prison to the community.  Since 2007, the Irish Prison Service has engaged Merchant's Quay Ireland to develop and deliver an effective prison-based Addiction Counselling Service. </p>  <p>  Local review meetings are held in prisons on a regular basis where a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence progression is discussed.  They are chaired by the Governor with the attendance of all members of the prison-based multi-disciplinary team.  Elements of these review discussions include the risk of re-offending on release, risk of homelessness on release, and proposed supports pre- and post-release in the case of prisoners being assessed for early release.</p>  <p>  The Community Return Programme is an incentivised early release scheme co-managed by the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service.  This involves an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work in a supervised group setting.  In addition a Community Support Scheme has been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short-term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service are actively engaged with senior management in the Department of Social Protection and Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government  with an overall aim of establishing a protocol between Departments for the case management of offenders who are at risk of homelessness in line with Pillar 1 of 'Rebuilding Ireland'.</p>  <p>  A new release planning policy for the Irish Prison Service will shortly be put into place and will represent considerable improvements to current pre-release planning and practices in Irish prisons.  This policy will address issues arising for the individual in custody under six key pillars: Housing/Accommodation Needs, Financial Supports, Healthcare, Public Safety and Statutory Requirements, Families and Personal Relationships, Education, Training and Employment.</p></reply>

The strategy is a whole of Government approach, involving seven Government Departments and a number of State bodies, including Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Many of the strategy's actions can be delivered within current resource allocations.  As stated at the time of the strategy's publication, it is intended that the strategy be a living document which will continue to be revised, added to and updated on an ongoing basis.  The resourcing of additional actions will form part of the normal estimates process.</p>  <p>  In so far as my own Department is concerned, the Deputy may wish to note I launched the national awareness campaign in November 2016 as part of the Second National Strategy.  The overall aim of the campaign is to increase the awareness of domestic and sexual violence, to bring about a change in long established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with the aim of decreasing and preventing this violence.  In order to run the campaign, I secured funding of &euro;950,000 in each of the years 2016 and 2017 and an additional &euro;200,000 has been awarded under the Dormant Accounts Fund for the years 2016-2017 to deliver the message of the national campaign on a local level through media partnerships with service providers across the country. </p></reply>

The overall cost of a report is likely to be in the order of &euro;1 million over three years.  A formal proposal submitted by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre recognised that, given the significant budget, funding would be divided between four Departments - the Departments of Justice and Equality, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health.  I wrote to the relevant Ministers on this matter and expressed my support for the project.  The responses received make the viability of funding the project, as proposed, unlikely.</p>  <p>  However, my Department continues to investigate the financial feasibility, resource implications and approaches to identifying a ring-fenced funding stream for undertaking a SAVI 2 study and to explore obligations with regard to requisite public procurement arrangements.  While I strongly recognise the value of further research in this area, I am sure the Deputy will accept that the right balance must be struck between the funding of front-line services and funding research.  I will, however, continue to pursue this matter. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, there are other sources of statistics that can be accessed.  The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) 2014 pan-European survey report on violence against women provides details of the prevalence of sexual violence by a partner or non-partner experienced by those women surveyed who are resident in Ireland.  Discussions have begun at a Eurostat level to explore the possibility of some form of replication of the FRA survey.  There is also the recent (June 2016) pan-European Eurobarometer survey on perceptions, attitudes and awareness of gender-based violence.  Figures on sexual violence in Ireland are also available from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Central Statistics Office/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and Sexual Assault Treatment Units.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Statistics Office are to explore the feasibility of including a module on sexual violence in its next roll-out of its crime and victimisation survey.  If it becomes an ongoing element of data gathering in CSO&rsquo;s crime and victimisation survey, the information gleaned from this work will provide indications of trends over time of peoples&rsquo; experiences of such violence.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p><p>The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 envisages a range of actions to be implemented by State, voluntary and community sector organisations aimed at preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in 2015 a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB). </p><p>The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly.  In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.  As part of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff.  These PSUs  are to ensure a consistent approach to domestic abuse and sexual crime, which will be supported by the national Bureau.  The PSUs will work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that these Divisional PSUs are being rolled-out in two phases.  Phase 1 involves the establishment of three Units over a 12-month period on a pilot basis.  The pilot Divisions that have been identified are the Dublin Metropolitan Region West, Cork City, and the Louth Division.  The assessment of this pilot phase will inform the further roll-out to each Garda Division.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 29 members and 8 civilians assigned to the GNPSB.  As the GNPSB was only formed in 2015 when a number of Garda units were brought together it is only possible to provide figures for 2015 and 2016.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties and is being commenced on a phased basis.  It is intended that significant progress will be made in 2017 on the implementation of the new decision-making support options provided for in the Act. </p>  <p>  The specific decision-making supports available under the Act to adults with capacity difficulties are decision-making assistants, co-decision-makers and decision-making representatives who will be supervised by the Director of the Decision Support Service.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act come into force.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  In relation to Wards of Court, the Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.  Once Part 6 is operational, each ward will be reviewed by the wardship court in accordance with the new system.  A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship.  A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the decision-making support option most appropriate to his or her needs.  The new support options must be operational before the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 can be repealed and the transition for wardship can commence.  In the interim, capacity cases will continue to be dealt with by the wardship court.</p></reply>

The gradual nature reflects the ongoing migratory pressures faced by Greece and the challenges which still exist in the Greek asylum system, particularly in relation to reception conditions, the treatment of vulnerable applicants and the timeframe for the processing of applications.  The Recommendation further sets out that transfers to Greece should only be resumed on the basis of individual assurances for each returnee to be given by the Greek authorities with a guarantee that they will be treated with dignity.  Guarantees must also be given that the applicant will be treated in accordance with EU law.  No transfers of unaccompanied minors are foreseen for the time being.  The resumption of transfers is not to be applied retroactively and will only apply to applicants who have entered Greece irregularly from 15 March 2017 onwards or for whom Greece is responsible from this date under the Dublin Regulation criteria. </p><p>A team of Member States&rsquo; experts will be established by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) to report on whether or not the applicants to be transferred back to Greece are being treated in accordance with the guarantees received from Greece.  The Commission will regularly monitor progress on the implementation of these recommendations and has indicated that it will issue further recommendations if required.  The Recommendation notes that exclusive competence for the decision in respect of transfers to Greece rests with the individual Member States&rsquo; authorities under the control of the courts, which may make preliminary references to the European Court of Justice on the interpretation of the Dublin Regulation.</p></reply>

Since then, over 42,000 appointments have been made.  This system brought an end for the need for customers to queue at the Burgh Quay offices for registration purposes.  The autumn is the busiest period in the office and over 2,000 more appointments were made in autumn 2016 as compared to autumn 2015.  During the first quarter of 2017, an additional 2,500 appointments were offered, as compared to the same period in 2016. </p>  <p>  At the launch of the AMS back in September there was a minor technical issue with the design of the system and it was taken off line for four days while this was rectified.  Apart from that there was one outage of two hours in October and two others for a matter of minutes.  It should be noted that the system operates on a 24 hour, seven days a week basis and apart from scheduled maintenance on one Saturday each month, it has had over 95% availability since 'go live'.  </p>  <p>  INIS advises applicants to book an appointment up to ten weeks before their permission expires.  Applicants who have not managed to secure an appointment before the expiry of their permission should check the website at 2:30pm daily to secure an early appointment.  I understand that INIS regularly monitors the system and will refine it as required.  I am informed that INIS recognises that emergency situations can arise.  Such cases are with dealt with on a case by case basis and enquiries should be sent to burghquayregoffice@justice.ie.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  Blanchardstown Garda District forms part of the DMR West Division. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the DMR West Division on the 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 672 and the strength of Blanchardstown District was 309 which includes 27 Community Garda&iacute;.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 76 of whom have been assigned to DMR West, Blanchardstown District.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda District, including the Blanchardstown District in the coming years. </p>  <p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will also facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

This is a significant increase on the 80% reported in the first audit of progress published last June.  I gave a clear commitment last June when Minister Stanton and I published the first audit of progress that the process of implementation would continue.  I am especially pleased that the key recommendation of the Working Group, the introduction of a single application procedure within our international protection process, has been implemented, following commencement of the International Protection Act, 2015 on 31 December last.  </p>  <p>  Under the single procedure, an applicant will make one application, and will have all grounds for seeking international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process.  This will positively address another key recommendation of the Working Group, the length of time which applicants spend in the process and consequently in the Direct Provision system.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm that legal issues around the extension of the remit of the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include access for residents in Direct Provision centres have now been clarified.  I am pleased to say we can now give effect to this recommendation and I expect that information will immediately be made available by both Offices to residents in all accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  The latest audit report also highlights the many improvements in living conditions for applicants and their families in Direct Provision Centres including the introduction of an independent living system in Mosney which will be rolled out to other centres during the course of 2017 and beyond.  These improvements are in line with our commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reform the Direct Provision system.  </p>  <p>  Significant progress has also been made in dealing with those in the protection process for the longest time.  When the Working Group examined the figures in 2015 there were 2,695 people in Direct Provision for 3 or more years.  As of 1 January this year, this has been reduced by 55% to 1,204 people.  The number of people in the system for 5 years or more has reduced by 58% from 1,946 to 811.  Only 251 of these are awaiting a final decision on their protection application and the vast majority of these cannot be processed for various reasons such as pending judicial review proceedings.  In effect, this means that almost all cases in the Direct Provision system for over five years that can be processed have been.  </p>  <p>  Details of progress on all of the 173 recommendations are available in the audit report which has been posted on my Department's website and on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. </p></reply>

A competition for appointment of Detective Garda&iacute; and Sergeants to Special Crime Operations has recently been completed and the needs of the specialist Garda Bureaus including the Cyber Crime Bureau will be considered, when successful candidates are being assigned.  </p><p>I am also advised by Garda management that two pilot regional cyber units have already been established in the Southern and South-Eastern Regions.</p><p>In addition, the Garda authorities are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be properly resourced to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and to take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.  Further, a module on cyber crime investigation has been included in the training programme for all trainee Garda&iacute;, with all other Garda personnel receiving training in cyber crime awareness and cyber crime investigation through the Garda Continuous Professional Development network.  </p><p>The Cyber Crime Bureau will continue to strengthen its links with the National Cyber Security Centre; industry partners; national and international stakeholders; and the UCD Centre for Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Investigation in the areas of research, development and training, as well as working closely with law enforcement partners to maintain and develop the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and prevent cyber crime and improve cyber security.</p><p>The establishment of the Bureau is also supported by the significant investment of an additional &euro;205 million in Garda ICT under the Government's Capital Plan between 2016 and 2021.

I am assured that Garda resources are deployed to respond to crime trends and policing needs at local level.  To be of assistance, I have brought the Deputy's concerns in relation to the Donaghmede area to the attention of the Garda authorities. </p><p>More generally, the Deputy will be aware that Operation Thor has been put in place to tackle burglary and related crimes, in both rural and urban areas.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  The most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period.  In fact, Raheny Garda Station, which services the Donaghmede area, recorded a reduction in burglary of 33% in 2015 when compared to the previous year.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.</p><p>Operation Thor has seen 38,894 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 50,823  targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 3,053 arrests and 3,733 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  </p><p>We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015.  I am pleased that these provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides garda&iacute; with investigative links ('hits') between people and unsolved crimes including burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years. </p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  It is important we build on the success of Operation Thor by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>-  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>-  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>-  be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>-  be without one or both legs;</p><p>-  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>-  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme is estimated to have cost of the order of &euro;65m in 2016.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>The disability criteria for the tax concessions available under the scheme have changed over time.  When the scheme was first introduced in 1968, the legislation only allowed for one medical ground.  In 1989, four new medical grounds were added and in 1994, one new medical ground was added. </p><p>I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.371.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800063#WRK00300"><p>In response to the Deputy's question the Moriarty Tribunal made a number of recommendations which affected a number of Government Departments. As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.</p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.  Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.  I and my European counterparts have been working steadfastly since the financial crisis to bring about strengthened oversight and resolution regimes.  The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.</p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes.  The capital requirements' regulation and directive, which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements. </p><p>The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign.  The overarching objective of the BRRD is to shift the cost of bank failure from taxpayers to shareholders and creditors of the institutions themselves. </p><p>The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.  The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which ECB led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.</p><p>All of these new regulations and institutional arrangements have been designed to address the challenges of banking oversight and resolution at a European level and provide for a proactive approach towards systemic and emergent risks at a European level.</p><p>Besides the introduction of new European and national regulations, the Central Bank too has increased its resources and has become more pro-active in addressing systemic risk.</p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.  These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders </b>- </p><p>In relation to this proposal, I remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform.  Representations are a valid part of the political process.  The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has advised in relation to the following  recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal that:</p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</b>- </p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.  This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements- </b>This recommendation has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission. However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further. The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government, therefore, sets out a number of important and practical measures which can be taken to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  Firstly, it wishes to promote competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) will work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  Pursuant to section 10(3) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, the CCPC will undertake an exercise which will involve:-</p>  <p>  (i) setting out how competition in the mortgage market operates in terms of interest rates and mortgage approval with a focus on outcomes in comparator jurisdictions;</p>  <p>  (ii) setting out what consumers want and expect in a properly functioning mortgage market;</p>  <p>  (iii) identifying gaps where competition or consumer protection is inadequate, including a survey of potential new entrants (both traditional and non-traditional) on barriers to entry into the Irish mortgage market;</p>  <p>  (iv) outlining of options, including their likely benefits and costs, to reduce the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve competition and consumer protection in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation.</p>  <p>  In liaison with the Central Bank, the CCPC has now commenced this work and this week announced a public consultation to gather all views about the future of the Irish mortgage market. The closing date for submissions is 20 March 2017.  The CCPC will produce a final report outlining their proposals by the end of May 2017.  For more information on this please see the following link: www.ccpc.ie/news/2017-02-20-future-irelands-mortgage-market-ccpc-opens-public-consultation.</p>  <p>  Secondly, the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would also help boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  In particular, the Programme for Government considers that the development of a code of conduct for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiative which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.  To that end, the Central Bank has commenced a programme of research on this topic and the Bank has indicated that the output of this work will be used to inform its consideration of the need for any future work in the area of mortgage switching and specifically around the need for a mortgage switching code.  </p>  <p>  A healthy commercial banking system that is in a position to provide finance to customers and is resilient to economic and financial market shocks, needs to be able to generate sustainable profits over the long term   for example, sufficient profit levels to absorb credit losses over the credit cycle while still generating capital.  In Ireland, the mis-pricing of risks in historical lending continues to be a significant contributor to weak profitability, as evidenced by the continued high level of non-performing loans, prevalence of very low yielding tracker mortgages, and low net interest margins.</p>  <p>  It also needs to be noted that the residential mortgage market is evolving and that it now comprises, inter alia, fixed interest rate mortgages, loan to value managed variable rate mortgages, trackers and restructured mortgages of various types.  Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed by only looking at standard variable rate mortgages, and any assessment, would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing.  The provision of clear information to consumers on mortgage products is, therefore, very important.  The Central Bank requires that all mortgages are advertised and sold in accordance with the requirements of financial services legislation (including Central Bank Codes), and that consumers who choose a given mortgage product (or to switch to a new product) are treated in accordance with these requirements in the context of the product they have chosen.  Also, the Central Bank has recently made changes to better inform and protect variable rate mortgage holders in relation to changes in the mortgage rate.  The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and are effective from 1 February, will require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.  The measures will also improve the level of information to be provided to borrowers about other mortgage products their lender provides that could provide savings for the borrower and signpost borrowers to the CCPC's mortgage switching tool.  Central Bank research has also showed that there is scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition rather than administrative controls is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.  This is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in its ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.  </p></reply>

Therefore on the basis of how insurers' assess their risks such a driver is going to represent in general a higher level of risk compared with a person who drives a short distance to work every day. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that while I cannot directly intervene in pricing of insurance products, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was finalised in December 2016, approved by Cabinet on January 10 2017, and subsequently published.  It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation and work on carrying these out is already well underway.</p>  <p>  While there is no single simple solution to effect a reduction in the cost of insurance, when taken cumulatively, the implementation of these 71 actions can deliver fairer premiums for consumers, including drivers who accumulate above-average mileage figures due to the nature of their job.

It is instead a targeted response that is aimed at first-time buyers, buying (or building) new residences.  This targeting is designed to help encourage the building of new homes, thereby increasing supply, by turning notional demand into real demand. By restricting this initiative solely to new dwellings and new self builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes should encourage the construction industry to provide for an additional supply of such properties.</p>  <p>  In line with these policy objectives, the Help to Buy scheme is not available for extensions to old houses in the manner in which the Deputy describes.</p>  <p>  The legislation under Section 477C(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, defines a qualifying residence as:</p>  <p> -  a new building which was not, at any time, used, or suitable for use, as a dwelling, or</p>  <p> -  a building which was not, at any time, in whole or in part, used, or suitable for use, as a dwelling and which has been converted for use as a dwelling.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the information provided in the Question, it is the view of the Revenue Commissioners that the extended property does not qualify for the incentive as the legislation requires that the building was not, in whole or in part, used, or suitable for use, as a dwelling.</p></reply>

The 'liability date' is always 1 November in the preceding year, for example 1 November 2016 is the 'liability date' for 2017.  The only exception in this regard was the 2013 'half year' where the 'liability date' was 1 May 2013.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where a relevant residential property is sold after the 'liability date', the vendor remains liable to pay the tax for the following year.  This remains the case even if the sale is completed before the start of the calendar year.  During the conveyancing process associated with a property sale it is normally the case that LPT obligations are finalised between the vendor and the purchaser before the transaction is completed. </p>  <p>  The person in question was correctly liable to pay the 2017 LPT charge on the Ballybrack property because she was the 'liable person' on 1 November 2016.  However, there was no statutory obligation on her to pay the 2017 LPT charge on the Shankill property because the vendor of that property was still the 'liable person' on 1 November 2016. </p>  <p>  Revenue is not aware of why the person opted to pay the 2017 charge on the Shankill property or why the statutory requirements in respect of the charge were not administered in accordance with the LPT legislation.  It may be that an agreement was reached between both parties during the conveyancing process that the person (as purchaser) would meet the 2017 payment on behalf of the vendor. </p>  <p>  However, any such arrangement was a matter between both parties and Revenue was not in any way involved.  The question of whether the 2017 liability on the Shankill property should have been paid by the purchaser (the person in question) or the vendor is a matter between both parties to resolve and on that basis it is not possible for Revenue to offset the 2017 payment to a future LPT liability in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at households with unsustainable long term mortgage arrears who qualify for social housing.  Under the scheme borrowers can switch to renting their home as social tenants.  Under the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness it was committed to review the scheme.  On 8 February 2017, the Minister Housing, Planning, Community &amp;amp; Local Government announced significant changes to the scheme.  This MTR review covered issues such as changes to the eligibility criteria, the financing of the scheme, administration and communications.  The review sets out a series of actions that will make MTR quicker, more transparent and more accessible for borrowers in mortgage distress.  The changes are designed to increase the number of households availing of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The MTR Review also announced the testing of alternative funding models for the scheme to deliver volume.  The Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a minimum of 200 units based on the new arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.  </p>  <p>  It is to be hoped that the test of the alternative MTR model will be positive and will result in a further scheme to aid as many distressed borrowers as possible to remain in their homes through a leasing arrangement.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must point out that as Minister for Finance, I am unable to intervene directly in the commercial decision-making process of any financial institution, which is a matter for the management boards of each institution.  Separately, however, I would refer the Deputy to the Central Bank Report on Mortgage Arrears, published on my Department's website on 16th December, which noted inter alia that: </p>  <p>  -  There is a broad range of available restructures offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities depending on the individual circumstances of the borrower;</p>  <p>  -  Since the June-2013 peak, considerable progress has been made in addressing mortgage arrears primarily through the use of restructures, rather than loss of ownership;</p>  <p>  -  The use of a range of restructuring options for distressed borrowers increases the potential for them to remain in the primary residence;</p>  <p>  -  Overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process.</p></reply>

As the legislation currently provides for the relief to continue until the end of December 2017, it was not necessary to include legislation in Finance Bill 2016 to provide for the tapered extension of the relief.  However in my Budget speech in October last I confirmed my intention to extend MIR beyond the current end date on a tapered basis to 2020 and that the details of the extension will be set out in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  Mortgage interest relief operates as a tax relief at source, meaning that the relief is deducted by the bank from the mortgage payment due, and the homeowner pays only the net amount due.  Therefore existing recipients of the relief could face a significant increase in their monthly mortgage payments when the tax relief at source is withdrawn (all other factors being equal).  The purpose of the proposed tapered extension is to avoid a sudden significant increase in mortgage repayments for those losing the relief, but instead to withdraw the relief gradually, allowing the mortgage holder time to adjust to the change in mortgage repayments.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, on foot of a change I introduced in Budget 2012, first time buyers who bought at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008 receive a rate of mortgage interest relief of 30%.  This compares favourably to the rates available to other remaining recipients of MIR which reduce on a gradual basis from 25% in years 1 and 2 of the mortgage to 15% in the 8th and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  Single individuals and married couples/civil partners that are first-time buyers qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven tax years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively.  Thereafter relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively.</p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan, when interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  It is worth noting that the application of the annual ceilings on interest qualifying for relief, and the stepped reduction in the rate of relief available to remaining recipients other than those who purchased between 2004 and 2008, already work to reduce the relief in a gradual manner. </p>  <p>  A review of policy considerations and potential costs of an extension of mortgage interest relief was contained in the Income Tax Reform Plan published by my Department in July last year and may be of interest to the Deputy.  The plan is available at: www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/Income%20Tax%20Reform%20Plan-FINAL_0.pdf.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the challenges that individuals continue to face notwithstanding the improving economic conditions.  In relation to negative equity, I would point out that the position is improving with the number of primary dwelling home mortgages in negative equity as of December 2015 having reduced to 15 per cent, a decline of 5 per cent since December 2014.</p></reply>

It was introduced by the previous Government to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm that is regulated by the Central Bank.  The significant point is that the regulation is focussed at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016.  It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms.  Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the various codes and Regulations mentioned already and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).</p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have:</p>  <p>  -  Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance;</p>  <p>  -  Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and</p>  <p>  -  Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  The legislation also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit servicing firm to perform such an action.  Therefore the borrower is protected because the owner cannot give an instruction that would breach the rules but also the instruction cannot be implemented by the regulated credit servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections that they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expects that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.</p></reply>

Engagement with the other stakeholders in both the public and private sector, including with Eurostat, is ongoing. </p>  <p>  ISIF informs me that whilst it has made progress in conjunction with the other stakeholders in the public and private sectors in respect of this opportunity, as well as other potential social housing investment opportunities, there are still considerable hurdles including commerciality and balance sheet treatment as identified in Rebuilding Ireland.  These hurdles must be overcome before any such proposals can be brought to a successful conclusion. </p>  <p>  Separately, ISIF is making a very substantial contribution to new private housing supply which is critical in terms of meeting the pent up demand for housing across all sectors of the market.  In line with its double bottom line mandate, ISIF has already invested in a number of significant financing platforms and projects in the construction sector, and is actively examining other investment opportunities.  </p>  <p>  ISIF has total investment commitments to housing investment vehicles of &euro;404m comprising &euro;325m in Activate Capital, &euro;25m in the Ardstone Residential Partnership and &euro;54m to student accommodation in DCU.  In addition ISIF has committed &euro;125m in total to more general real estate investment vehicles, including &euro;75m to the Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund and &euro;50m to Quadrant Real Estate Advisors, both of which to date have completed some investment in housing.  Through these ISIF-supported projects, a total of 8,400 housing units is expected to be delivered in the near term (a small portion of which has already been delivered).</p>  <p>  In addition, ISIF's current near term pipeline of potential housing projects including in the build-to-rent sector and off-campus student accommodation as well as a smaller project that may have the ability to deliver some affordable housing, indicates potential to deliver a further 8,700 units in total.</p>  <p>  ISIF is working with local authorities and private developers on the financing of housing-enabling infrastructure and its pipeline includes two pilot housing infrastructure financing projects which, if completed, will enable the development of a further 6,000 housing units. </p>  <p>  ISIF is also currently engaging with a range of Higher Education Institutions ("HEIs") in respect of the provision by them of on-campus student accommodation.  </p>  <p>  ISIF invests on a risk adjusted basis in the various housing financing platforms and these platforms, in turn, provide finance, also on a risk adjusted basis, to developers, which can be equity or debt according to the business model of each platform.  The interest rate applied to any individual debt financing arrangement therefore relates to the level of risk and other investment factors in the underlying housing development proposal.</p></reply>

Fiscal rules are all-the-more important in a monetary union, given the scope for spillovers among participating Member States.</p>  <p>  Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins and facilitates the goals of sustainability and economic growth.  Ireland's recent and continued economic recovery is testament to this. </p>  <p>  It is evidently important that rules are implemented in a fair and consistent manner and that all Member States are treated equally concerning the application of the Stability and Growth Pact.  This is essential for the continued credibility of these rules.  Any perception that the rules are not being applied in an equitable manner could result in the undermining of the Stability and Growth Pact.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland we have defended and complied with the fiscal rules through difficult times.  This defence becomes progressively more difficult if there is any suggestion that the rules are not being applied consistently, particularly when there are perceived differences between the treatment of small and large Member States.  So I would have some sympathy with the view of Chairman Dijsselbloem that unequal application could undermine confidence in the rules and, in this regard, I would reiterate that the fiscal rules must be applied in a transparent, consistent and fair  manner.</p></reply>

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including through the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme study published in November 2015 titled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'.  This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Following the result of the UK referendum and to prepare for the forthcoming negotiations, work has been intensified across the whole of Government including in the Department of Finance.  A new Brexit Unit, within the EU and International Division, was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit.  As part of Budget 2017, the Department also published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy.  Utilising the sectoral exposure analysis, Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to support any opportunities that might arise.  These included measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agri-food and Irish exporters.  The Department also worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report entitled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published in November 2016.  Updated macroeconomic forecasts will be published by the Department as part of the Stability Programme Update in April 2017. </p>  <p>  Important work is also ongoing in relation to financial services.  In particular, on 23 January 2017, Minister of State Murphy launched the International Financial Services (IFS 2020) Action Plan 2017 which sets out the approach to Brexit for this sector.</p>  <p>  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, Budget 2017 signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer. </p>  <p>  The work being done by the Department will be an important input to ensuring that Ireland will be in a position to counter any negative economic impact arising from Brexit and to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.  The Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts, to carry out relevant analysis and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context.</p></reply>

The levy was charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raises approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year does not exceed &euro;100,000, the levy is not payable.</p>  <p>  In the budget statement two years ago, I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the levy.</p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department in early 2016.  Following that review, I decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.  I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect.  Firstly, it ensures that financial institutions entering the market over the five further years for which the levy will apply will be subject to the levy and financial institutions exiting the market will cease to be subject to the levy.  Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, I have to increase the rate at which the levy is charged from 35% to 59% for 2017.  This is because the assessable amount, DIRT payments in 2015, have reduced significantly since 2011.  This new rate, combined with the new 2015 base year, will preserve the existing contribution of &euro;150 million paid by the affected financial institutions.  That rate will be subject to review to ensure that the yield from the levy is not impacted from changes in interest rates and/or DIRT rates.</p></reply>

My primary objective in the disposal of any AIB shares will be to maximise the return for the State in a manner that is consistent with recovering our full &euro;20.8bn investment over time.</p>  <p>  The advice I have received confirms that an IPO is the optimal route to recouping value from this investment.  Officials in my Department along with our Independent Financial Advisor, Rothschild, have done considerable preparatory work in this regard.  In December of last year, following a competitive procurement process, three firms were appointed to act as Global Coordinators on a potential selling syndicate, in preparation for a possible IPO.  These firms have been appointed for an 18 month period and additional firms will be appointed to fill out the selling syndicate at an appropriate future date.</p>  <p>  I cannot predict what market conditions will be like for bank shares over the coming year, however it is our intention to be ready to execute a transaction if conditions allow and I have indicated that the earliest possible IPO window will be in the second quarter of 2017.  Given the improved state of the national accounts, progress made in reducing our national debt and positive market sentiment towards Ireland, we are not under any pressure to monetise our banking investments.  As a result we have some flexibility around when we time our disposals in the market.</p>  <p>  It would not be possible or prudent for me to estimate the amount which might be received from any future sale of shares in AIB at this time.  This will depend both on the quantum of shares sold and the price arrived at in the market during the IPO process.</p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, all capital returned from the State's investments in the Irish banks will be used to reduce the national debt.  That is the prudent course of action as it reduces our ongoing borrowing costs and ensures the future strength and stability of the economy.</p></reply>

Significant work has also been undertaken aimed at ensuring the rigour and stability of the alternative set of estimates.  Progress on this work had been delayed by the distortions in the 2015 national accounts revisions.  The intention is to detail this work in a forthcoming Department of Finance technical paper.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this progress on the development of alternative models, the harmonised methodology remains the binding methodology in the context of EU fiscal surveillance.  However, progress also continues to be made at technical level - with participation in the relevant working group of all Member States - on improving this harmonised methodology, and Ireland continues to actively contribute on this front.  Indeed, recognising the importance of this work from an Irish perspective, the relevant working group at a European level is chaired by a senior official in my Department.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would stress that, in the assessment of the cyclical position of the economy, my Department takes into consideration a wide range of indicators, in addition to supply-side estimates.</p></reply>

In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015. </p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing fuel laundering in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted a National Random Sampling Programme in January 2016, with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programme methodology entailed taking samples of road diesel from a randomly selected group of licensed traders and testing for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new fiscal marker was found in any of the samples tested.  This provides very persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has been successful in addressing the laundering problem. </p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up earlier this year, in the framework of "A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan", of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.  The Deputy may be interested to note that in an intelligence-led operation in December 2016, Revenue enforcement officers supported by the Garda Regional Support Unit, seized two oil tankers, 20,000 litres of laundered mineral oil, 140 bags of bleaching earth, ancillary equipment associated with oil laundering and cash, bank drafts and cheques in excess of &euro;60,000 in the Castleblayney area.  This is the first oil laundry detected in this jurisdiction since 2014.</p>  <p>  The penalties for offences relating to fuel fraud are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999.  On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both.  Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both.  In addition, for an indictable offence under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, if the value of the fuel concerned in the fraud exceeds &euro;250,000, including duty and taxes, the court may impose a penalty of three times the value of the fuel, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both.  The current levels of fines were introduced by the Finance Act 2010 and represented significant increases over the previous amounts: for example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.</p>  <p>  The Courts decide on the amount of the fine to be imposed in any particular case and, in practice, do not apply fines up to the existing limits.  There are no proposals at present to increase the level of fines available to the courts.  However, the position is kept under review taking account, among other considerations, of the practical experience of the fines imposed under the current provisions.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's work against fuel laundering has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action against fuel fraud will continue to be a high priority.</p></reply>

I think it is important to be clear on what the Governor said.  He said that in addition to the four primary challenges he identified in the regulatory treatment of financial innovations, technological innovation may also alter the role of central banks in managing the money supply and acting as a lender of last resort.</p>  <p>  He instanced the growth in electronic forms of payment and said that at one level this growth looks set to reduce the traditional role of notes and coins in the monetary system.  He noted that this may have implications for the role of central banks generally in managing the money supply.  He also said that, at another level, there is much discussion on the relative merits of more widespread adoption of private-sector digital currencies versus a new role for central banks in the direct issuance and management of publicly-backed digital currencies.</p>  <p>  If, in time, there is to be a new role of this kind for central banks in the Euro area, it would have to be agreed at a European level.  The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament published a report on virtual currencies in May 2016 which called for the creation of a horizontal taskforce on distributed ledger technology to be set up under the leadership of the European Commission.  The Deputy is likely to be aware that the European Commission has published proposals to amend the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive including provisions on virtual currencies and negotiations on these proposals are ongoing.</p></reply>

This survey series, currently being conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering over 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, and in all regions are included.  </p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey covering the period April to September 2016 which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/sme-credit-lending.  This latest survey indicates that the majority of credit requests continue to be approved fully with 84% of credit applications (excluding 'still pending') approved or partially approved.  The current rate of decline stands at 15% of all applications (including 'still pending').  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland's most recent SME Market Report for the second half of 2016 also shows that rejection rates, for credit applications by SMEs, loan/overdraft rejection rates are in line with euro area averages.  This report can be found here: www.centralbank.ie/publications/Documents/SME%20Market%20Report%202016H2.pdf.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments and Agencies such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to support and monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

This vehicle should be capable of funding the delivery of substantial new mixed-tenure residential developments, comprising social and private housing.</p>  <p>  Whilst a major objective of any such funding vehicle is to leverage additionality in terms of social housing supply, it is envisaged that a substantial portion of the overall supply of new units may need to be for private housing to meet the commerciality test and to satisfy the requirements of an off-balance sheet investment model.    </p>  <p>  Although there have been a number of recent proposals in this space from private sector residential investors and developers, none have proven to be either commercial or likely to pass the requirements for an off-balance sheet model.  </p>  <p>  Engagement with a wide array of key stakeholders in both the public and private sector is ongoing and involves the input of relevant Government departments, the CSO and others.  There is ongoing engagement, also, with the European authorities, including Eurostat, and the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Initial discussions with the EIB have taken place, and these have explored possible EIB participation in funding the housing model.  These discussions follow recent interaction between this Department and ISIF with the EIB regarding EIB support for housing projects in other Member States.  Initial discussions and soundings indicate that the EIB is interested in supporting a housing model.  Attention is now focused on developing a model which meets the off-balance sheet requirements, and one in which the EIB might participate.</p>  <p>  On the occasion of the formal launch of the EIB Group office in Ireland on 9 December 2016, I chaired the first meeting of the EIB-Ireland Financing Group, comprising relevant Government Ministers, heads of agencies and EIB senior management.

From September 2016 onwards CUAC continued working to enable a coherent implementation plan be devised.  The Department has been working closely with CUAC.</p>  <p>  In line with CUAC's recommendations, the Department invited one nominee from each of the stakeholder groups.  The Implementation Group consists of a representative from each of the following: Irish League of Credit Unions; Credit Union Development Association; Credit Union Managers' Association; National Supervisors Forum; and the Central Bank.  The Implementation Group also has a CUAC representative and is chaired by the Department.  This broad membership will ensure participation and contribution from all credit union perspectives.</p>  <p>  The Implementation Group held its inaugural meeting on Monday 20 February 2017 and was also attended by all CUAC members.  It is intended that each CUAC recommendation will addressed separately with a view to implementation at the appropriate time.  Meetings will continue on a monthly basis with the next meeting scheduled for late March 2017.  The term of the Implementation Group is for one year which may be extended at the discretion of the Minister.  I look forward to receiving regular progress reports on the implementation of these important recommendations.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has recently approved a suite of additional services known as a Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS) under the Additional Services Framework set out in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act.  This service, which was recently approved for 6 applicant credit unions provides for credit unions to offer debit cards, overdrafts and a full range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework.  Details of MPCAS and the approval process, along with the application requirements and related guidance are on the Central Bank's website.  In its communication to the sector on MPCAS on 9 December 2016, the Central Bank highlighted that it will continue to consider, all applications for provision of additional services including debit cards.</p>  <p>  Currently credit unions can provide mortgages to members, within certain maturity limits contained in the 2016 Regulations.  The 2016 Regulations set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member.  Under the 2016 Regulations, issued by the Central Bank in January 2016, credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions are able to apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years). Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.  There are 11 credit unions approved to avail of increased longer term lending limits.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank informs me that the December 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall, total gross loans over 10 years amount to c. 2.7% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10% (and 15% in some cases).  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer term lending, including mortgages, as part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in their analyses credit unions need to consider the impact of longer term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure   as the issue of funding longer term lending with short term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.  The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidenced based business case. </p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) recent report provides a number of recommendations, one of which is to conduct a full review of lending limits.  I have established an Implementation Group which is currently looking at those recommendations with a view to implementation as appropriate. One area which the Implementation Group is focussing on is an examination of lending limits and concentration limits.  I look forward to regular progress reports from the Implementation Group as these recommendations are developed and implemented.</p></reply>

All claims received are passed to the Administrator, Mr Kieran Wallace, who is required to certify the compensable loss involved for each claimant, following which notification, the ICCL will arrange payment of compensation to the investors concerned.</p>  <p>  As at 24 February 2017, the ICCL had paid out over &euro;7.2 million to some 570 claimants.  It is estimated by the Administrator that further compensation amounting to &euro;12.9 million will arise in respect of the c. 1,407 claims still outstanding, resulting in a final compensation bill of &euro;19.7 million. This amount has been fully provided for in the ICCL's accounts. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Act the ICCL is obliged to pay compensation within three months of the certification of the relevant claim by the appointed Administrator of the investment firm concerned and notification to the ICCL.  The liquidation and administration of CHC has proved to be a complex and protracted exercise partly due to a number of legal issues arising in the course of the liquidation of the firm. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this has resulted in lengthy delays in the certification of claims by the Administrator.  ICCL have been seeking to address these matters on an on-going basis and have made proposals to the Administrator regarding the acceleration of the certification process and are awaiting further developments. </p>  <p>  During 2016 the Board of ICCL established a working group to formulate potential remedies to certification delays experienced in current claim cases.  In November 2016 this working group issued a report to myself and the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland wherein conclusions and recommendations were highlighted with the general objective of improving the outcome for the clients concerned. </p>  <p>  While a number of the proposals put forward are being progressed by the ICCL, others would encompass amendments to legislation. </p>  <p>  ICCL is currently consulting with the Central Bank, as the supervisory authority for investor compensation and once completed will then engage with my Department on these proposed amendments. </p></reply>

However if the High Court ruling is upheld then the MIBI will compensate third parties fully up to a limit of &euro;1,220,000 per claim for property, regardless of the number of claimants, while there will be no cap on payments for personal injury claims.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a small number of additional claims are not affected by the court proceedings and are being processed by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice due to the fact that they are 1st party claims and come unambiguously within the remit of the  Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).  In relation to these policyholders the cap of 65% applies and in total &euro;608,085  has been made to date to such Setanta policyholders.</p><p>The position in relation to 3rd party motor insurance claims is that they are unlikely to be processed until after the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal.</p><p>The Liquidator for Setanta has informed me that:</p><p>-  Claims provision required stands at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.</p><p>-  Setanta policies were cancelled in May 2014.  The 2 years allowable under the statute of limitation to lodge claims has expired so the claims figures will not increase further.</p><p>-  The Liquidator reports that it is proving difficult to settle claims in advance of the outcome of the MIBI appeal.</p><p>-  The Liquidator continues to be of the view that he will not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims.</p><p>I expect to be able to provide a more accurate update after the legal proceedings are concluded.</p></reply>

The amounts payable in respect of claims under the Road Traffic Act is 100% to a current limit of &euro;1,220,000 per claim for property, regardless of the number of claimants.  The limit does not apply in the case of personal injury.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland, which was published in June 2016, sets out the Joint Working Group's assessment of the current framework and makes recommendations to provide certainty regarding the compensation framework in Ireland. Its key recommendations are:</p>  <p>  -  The level of cover from the ICF for third party motor insurance claims be increased from 65% to 100% in line with that currently provided by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.</p>  <p>  -  The increased coverage of the ICF be funded by a direct contribution to the ICF from the motor insurance industry. While the Review   indicated that this would come  via the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, to the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims, further discussions are ongoing with industry about options for alternative funding arrangements which would provide greater  predictability about their financial exposure.</p></reply>

A report of the Provisional Liquidator was considered by the Supreme Court of Gibraltar on 26 October 2016, after which the Supreme Court agreed with the appointment of a liquidator to Enterprise.  Upon appointment, the Liquidator disclaimed all Enterprise motor policies resulting in all motor policies written by Enterprise ceasing to be effective from midnight 26 October 2016.  </p>  <p>  According to the Enterprise website, the Liquidator is currently confirming arrangements for the management of claims as well as establishing the process by which claims may be submitted.  Directions for the submission of claims will be detailed on the website of for Enterprise (www.eigplc.com/) as soon as they are available.  Persons who have a query or a claim should contact the Liquidator and his team on telephone number 00 350 200 50150 or info@eigplc.com. </p>  <p>  My officials are liaising with the liquidator to find out the number and value of outstanding claims.  At this stage, this information has not been made available. </p>  <p>  In relation to refunds for outstanding cover on policies, Enterprise's agent in Ireland, Wrightway Underwriting Ltd, has advised the Central Bank that it has informed brokers to make an ex-gratia payment to affected policyholders.  This payment will be equal to the value of the premium from 26 October 2016 until the end of the current policy contract . Policyholders are advised by the Central Bank to discuss any such refunds with their broker. </p>  <p>  In relation to the role of the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) the Deputy should note that it provides for payments to meet the liabilities of insolvent insurers in certain cases where it is unlikely that claims can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  Management and administration of the ICF is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  Under the Insurance Act 1964, in a liquidation all ICF payments are subject to a limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  In addition, claims by bodies corporate or incorporated bodies are not covered by the ICF, except where there is a liability to or by an individual. </p>  <p>  In relation to the role of the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI), the High Court issued a decision in the Law Society of Ireland v the MIBI case to the effect that the MIBI's liability under the 2009 Agreement extended to situations of insurer insolvency (subject to each individual claim being deemed eligible).  This decision was then appealed by the MIBI, however in March 2016, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.  Subsequently, in April 2016, the Supreme Court made an order allowing an appeal to that Court.  This appeal was heard by the Supreme Court in October 2016 and judgement was reserved.  No date has been specified for delivery of the judgment.  If the High Court ruling is upheld then the MIBI will be liable to compensate third parties up to a limit of &euro;1,220,000 per claim for property, regardless of the number of claimants, while there will be no cap on payments for personal injury claims.  </p></reply>

The event was hosted by my colleague Minister of State for Financial Services, Eoghan Murphy TD, who has responsibility for the IFS2020 strategy. IDA Ireland and EI had lead responsibility for organising this event, in consultation with the Department of Finance and other key public sector and industry stakeholders.  I attended the closing sessions of the EFF and gave the final remarks to close off a day of very interesting speeches, panel discussions and presentations.</p>  <p>  The European Financial Forum 2017 was a tremendous success with approximately 700 delegates in attendance, representing around 400 companies from 30 countries.  The 2017 Forum featured keynote speakers and panel discussions on a number of themes.  A major focus for the 2017 Forum was the macro economic outlook for the global economy and impacts for financial services.  Given the many international developments in 2016, the EFF2017 was particularly timely in shaping the discussion around the outlook for financial services in our ever changing world. Preliminary planning has begun for a possible third European Financial Forum early in 2018.</p>  <p>  EFF 2017 featured 24 domestic and international speakers which included President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Jin Liqun; Blackrock Vice Chairman, Philipp Hildebrand; and Credit Suisse Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors (and Chair of the British Bankers' Association), Noreen Doyle among others.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Murphy launched IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 the evening before the forum.  The 2017 plan was drafted following extensive engagement with both public and private sector stakeholders through the IFS2020 implementation framework.  The 2017 Action Plan is divided into two sections.  Section one is a contextual piece outlining the development of the Strategy with a strong focus on Brexit while section two contains the suite of 40 individual measures to be actioned in 2017 under the IFS2020 strategic priorities, with the Department or agency responsible for each measure, and the timeline for delivery.  A copy of the 2017 Action plan was provided to each attendee of the EFF.</p>  <p>  Since his appointment Minister Murphy has undertaken a significant number of overseas visits to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and launch the IFS Ireland banner brand.  In September 2016 Minister Murphy travelled to Singapore, Shanghai and Tokyo, in October he visited New York and Washington and in January participated at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong while also visiting Beijing.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Murphy will continue to promote Ireland overseas as the perfect European location for financial services investment as the IFS2020 Strategy moves into 2017, with upcoming engagements in London, Brussels and a visit to Asia in May.  Minister Murphy will of course meet with international IFS firms and promote our financial services offering during his St Patrick's Day visits to Montreal and Toronto.  In addition officials from my department continue to engage with key financial services stakeholders through the IFS2020 framework to ensure continued growth and development of the international financial services sector in Ireland. </p></reply>

However during the period from 2009 to 2015, there were underwriting losses of &euro;1.3bn, with motor insurance accounting for &euro;900m of this.  It should also be noted that the low interest rate environment has materially affected the levels of interest or investment income which insurers can earn and has reduced their ability to compensate in part for their underwriting losses.</p>  <p>  The issue of profitability therefore has been problematic for the industry in the last few years and this has been a contributory factor to the price increases over the last 18 months. </p>  <p>  My primary focus at this stage is ensuring that the Cost of Motor Insurance Report is fully implemented as I believe this will lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and will help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past (both up and down).  It should also better facilitate  new entrants into the market which in turn should provide consumers with a greater choice of companies to choose from.</p></reply>

The Commission is forecasting GDP growth for Ireland of 3.4 per cent this year, a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points relative to Autumn 2016. This is broadly in line with my own Department's forecast of 3.5 per cent growth this year, published as part of Budget 2017.  According to these forecasts Ireland is expected to be among the fastest growing economies in Europe this year.  </p><p>The dataflow since the Budget has been encouraging indicating that the strong momentum has continued:</p><p>-  The economy expanded by 6.9 per cent year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2016.</p><p>-  Exports are holding up well. Service exports have been particularly strong recording double-digit growth, year-on-year, in the third quarter.</p><p>-  Employment in the fourth quarter of 2016 grew by 3.3 per cent on an annual basis - an increase of over 65,000 jobs. </p><p>-  Data for 2017 is likewise encouraging with the unemployment rate for January falling to 6.8 per cent, down from 8.6 per cent a year earlier.</p><p>On this basis, the economy remains on course for continued robust growth this year. However, we do face considerable economic challenges, notably Brexit, the change in policy direction by the new US administration, and growing uncertainty in the global economy.  This was explicitly recognised in the economic outlook published with the Budget, which detailed risks to the outlook and noted that these are firmly tilted to the downside.  </p><p>Updated macroeconomic forecasts will be published by my Department, as part of the Stability and Programme Update, in April this year.</p></reply>

In line with the Bank's mandate to ensure that the best interests of consumers are protected, the Central Bank's immediate focus is to ensure that lenders prioritise the identification of impacted customers and prevent further harm.  </p><p>The scope of the Tracker Mortgage Examination covers all lenders which sold tracker mortgage accounts, including both for the family home and investment properties, up to the end of 2015:</p><p>-  that originated on tracker interest rates;</p><p>-  that had tracker interest rates applied at any stage during the term of the underlying mortgage agreements and-or</p><p>-  where the underlying mortgage agreements provided for contractual rights to or options for tracker interest rates at any stage during the term of the agreements.</p><p>All tracker mortgage accounts that fall within this scope are covered by the Examination.</p><p>The Examination is a key priority for the Central Bank and it is working to ensure that the Examination is completed as soon as possible.  While significant progress has been made, the Central Bank advises that due to the scale and complexity of the review, it will take some further time to complete. </p><p>In December the Central Bank issued a statement which indicated that so far lenders had identified approximately 8,200 accounts where a right to, or the option of, a tracker rate of interest and/or the correct rate of interest was not provided to customers in accordance with lenders' contractual or regulatory requirements.  In his subsequent appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the Governor indicated that this is a lower band figure and that it is expected the number of affected cases will be higher. </p><p>Based on current progress, the Central Bank expects that all relevant lenders will have identified and commenced engagement with most impacted customers by mid-2017.  Payment of redress and compensation, processing and consideration of any customer appeals and the Central Bank's own assurance work will continue beyond this point for some lenders. </p><p>The Central Bank has set down a robust framework whereby lenders' internal reviews will be overseen by independent third parties.  As part of the Examination, the Central Bank has made very clear what it expects of lenders in terms of redress and compensation to impacted customers.</p></reply>

An individual who provides the services in the course of a trade can avail of the normal trading deductions in computing his or her taxable profits.</p>  <p>  In relation to rental income arising to landlords, I am advised that the taxable income is the gross rent less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent, as specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. The main deductible expenses are:</p>  <p>  -  any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p>  <p>  -  the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p>  <p>  -  the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p>  <p>  -  the interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property, which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 80% of the interest and is subject to compliance with Private Residential Tenancies Board registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year (full interest deductibility is being restored incrementally by way of annual 5% increases, with full restoration by 2021).  The restriction does not apply to certain lettings to tenants in receipt of social housing supports; and</p>  <p>  -  the payment of local authority rates. </p>  <p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.

The initiative aims to assist a first-time purchaser to fund the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new property to serve as their principal primary residence . The scheme is open to both those who are purchasing new builds from a developer, and those who self-build.</p>  <p>  The application process for the Help to Buy incentive varies depending on the relevant property type.  For new builds purchased on or after 1 January 2017, which meet the requirements of the scheme, the appropriate rebate is payable directly to the developer once the contract to purchase the property has been entered into.  In this manner it forms part of the 10% deposit that is usually paid to the developer by the purchaser.</p>  <p>  For applicants who are undertaking to self-build a property and who draw down the first tranche of their qualifying loan on or after 1 January 2017, the refund is paid to the claimant's bank account following such draw down.  The information supplied by the claimant must be verified by the claimant's solicitor before any refund is paid.</p>  <p>  There is also a third category of claimants under the Help to Buy incentive, known as retrospective claimants.  This comprises individuals who have contracted to purchase a new build home, or who have drawn down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build a home, in the period between 19 July 2016 and 31 December 2016.  As these individuals would have already paid their deposits/commenced building prior to the commencement of the incentive, any potential rebate they are due under the scheme will be paid retrospectively directly to them.  Retrospective claimants are required to submit supporting documentation including a signed copy of the contract, evidence of their mortgage or mortgage drawdown, and details of the property directly to Revenue.</p></reply>

These are not the same thing.</p>  <p>  Public Private Partnership (PPP) unitary payments for infrastructure projects, including those co-financed under EFSI constitutes general government expenditure and are relevant for the calculation of the general government balance and the assessment of compliance with Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) obligations.</p>  <p>  With regard to contributions to EFSI, the European Commission communication referenced by the Deputy provides clarification on the treatment of these, debt guarantees and co-financing by Member States under the fiscal rules.</p>  <p>  The communication makes the point that the fiscal adjustment required under the preventive arm of the SGP, until the medium-term budgetary objective is attained, is set in structural terms.  This excludes one-off measures in addition to taking account of the economic cycle.  The communication states that cash contributions provided by Member States to EFSI will be counted as one-off measures and excluded from the structural balance calculation, even if the payments in question were classified as general government expenditure.  The communication notes that the classification of transactions is a matter for Eurostat. </p>  <p>  Guarantees provided by Member States to EFSI do not impact on deficit or debt unless a guarantee is called, at which time it would impact on both the general government balance and debt.</p>  <p>  In terms of co-financing individual projects, equity participation will have no impact on deficit or debt as long as there is a market rate of return.  The equity may impact on debt levels if financed through government borrowing.</p>  <p>  Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP projects.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  In addition, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has successfully engaged with European Financial Instruments such as the COSME and the InnovFin Guarantee Programme, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window.  These support the financing needs of SMEs and aims to ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, approval of Exchequer capital projects and PPP projects are the policy responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and, in this context, he engages with each line Department on an ongoing basis to consider and assess projects and the full range of available funding options. </p></reply>

Section 100 of Finance Act 2007 terminated this charge for such 'mortgage' documents executed after this date.</p><p>Section 85 of the SDCA 1999 provides for an exemption from stamp duty on:</p><p>- the issue of loan capital or any Government loan;</p><p>- the transfer of companies' loan capital;</p><p>- the issue or transfer of securities issued by a qualifying company within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997;</p><p>- the issue, transfer or redemption of loan capital issued by a company to raise finance to acquire, develop or lease aircraft.</p><p>Section 86 of the SDCA 1999 provides for an exemption on the transfer of loan stock issued by certain State bodies.</p><p>Section 90 of the SDCA 1999, in dealing with debt factoring arrangements, provides for an exemption on the transfer of a debt, or part of a debt, where such transfer occurs in the ordinary course of the business of the vendor or the purchaser.</p><p>Relief from stamp duty is also provided in relation to transfers of property (whether real or intangible) between associated companies (section 79 SDCA 1999) or in relation to the merger of companies where such transfers are effected for bona fide commercial reasons (section 80 SDCA 1999).  Depending on the particular circumstances and the type of company involved, it could happen that some part of the property transferred could relate to loans.</p><p>As stamp duty is not generally payable on documentation transferring a loan, the question of &quot;taking proceedings&quot; on this issue does not arise.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that normally any profit earned from the sale of loans from one entity to another is chargeable to corporation tax as a trading receipt.  This is the position as regards the financial services sector in particular.  Therefore, in general, the sale of a loan does not constitute a disposal of an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.  The exception to this general rule is where a loan is a debt on a security (section 541(1) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997). In this context, a security includes any loan stock or similar security of any government or of any public authority or of any company, but does not include Irish Government securities.</p><p>In the context of the financial services sector the issue of CGT does not arise.  Accordingly as CGT is not payable on gains earned from the sale of loans from one entity to another the question of &quot;taking proceedings&quot; on the issue does not arise.</p></reply>

However, based on uptake to date, Revenue estimate the cost of the scheme for 2016 to be in the region of &euro;32.5 million.  This cost relates to capital raised of approximately &euro;108 million by qualifying SMEs and does not take into account any payments of additional relief in respect of investments made in 2013.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for the additional relief, the company must have increased the numbers employed over the four year holding period or have spent the capital raised on research and development.  Returns outlining the employment created over a four year period have only been made to Revenue in respect of the companies who availed of EII relief in 2012.  In respect of those companies, it is estimated that approximately 230 additional employments have been created.  Information for 2013 onwards will only be available in subsequent years.</p></reply>

In this regard a lender must examine each case on its individual merits and it must base its assessment on the full circumstances of the borrower, including, inter alia, the borrower's current repayment capacity. In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable in each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements that they offer. The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.</p>  <p>  The CCMA is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.  It is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 and applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  The recent Central Bank report on Mortgage Arrears, published on the Department of Finance website on 16th December 2016, found that overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process with regard to mortgage arrears on family homes.  I would therefore urge those with mortgage debt to engage with their lender by completing a standard financial statement of their income and expenditure or contact their local Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) office for independent professional and confidential advice.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government, therefore, sets out a number of important and practical measures which can be taken to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  Although Ireland is in a monetary union with other Euro area Member States, it has to be acknowledged that there are many factors, such as differences in national legal and housing systems, cultural preferences, language, the proximity of lenders to borrowers, which will continue to inhibit the full integration of the residential mortgage market and of mortgage interest rates in the Euro area and the wider EU.  More directly, differences in the nature of mortgage and other credit markets, credit and market conditions, mortgage default rates and the funding of mortgage credit will also impact on the levels of mortgage lending rates between and within different countries.</p>  <p>  However, there have been some developments which seek to promote a more harmonised market for credit across the EU.  In particular, the 2014 Mortgage Credit Directive, which has now been transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, seeks to develop a more harmonised, efficient and competitive internal market for the provision of residential mortgages to consumer borrowers and this should help to promote the closer integration of EU mortgage markets over time.</p>  <p>  In terms of the national context, this Government is committed to reducing the cost of secured mortgage lending. </p>  <p>  Firstly, it wishes to promote competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) will work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  </p>  <p>  In liaison with the Central Bank, the CCPC has now commenced this work and last week announced a public consultation to gather views about the future of the Irish mortgage market.  The closing date for submissions is 20 March 2017. The CCPC will produce a final report outlining their proposals by the end of May 2017. </p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.  This is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in its ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.</p></reply>

According to the Central Bank's Credit, Money and Banking Statistics, outstanding loans have fallen from a peak of over &euro;10.28 billion in December 2007 to &euro;1.14 billion in September 2016.  Although this process of deleveraging continues, the ongoing recovery in construction activity is evident in growth of new lending to Irish construction firms, which increased by 14 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2016.  Construction-related lending is in addition to that for the purposes of real estate, land and development activities, where total loans outstanding fell from a peak of &euro;106 billion in September 2008 to &euro;17.3 billion in September 2016. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for the construction sector to move away from the former 100 per cent debt financing model and instead adopt a more appropriate risk-weighted model of funding, my Department has actively encouraged the development of alternative sources of development finance.  ISIF, under the auspices of the NTMA, continues to explore ways of funding projects that will enhance the supply of housing. Currently Activate Capital, the joint venture between ISIF and KKR, is providing funding on a commercial basis to fund the development and construction of housing. </p>  <p>  The availability of development finance alone will not be sufficient to encourage development unless projects are seen as commercially viable.  As part of Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Government has set out a comprehensive package of measures designed to address the structural constraints which continue to inhibit the viability of construction.  These measures include the establishment of a Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), the development of a fast-track planning approvals process for large scale developments and a commitment to undertake a root-and-branch review of the planning system. </p></reply>

This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs. SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources. </p><p>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2016, which can be found at <i>. </i></p><p>The results of this survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.

Working capital/cash flow requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 27% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 73% of working capital coming from this source (up 6%).  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment. </p><p>The SME State Bodies Group, chaired by my Department, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Action Plan for Jobs over the past number of years has set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.  These Government policies have supported year on year increases in new lending to SMEs, as measured by the Central Bank.</p><p>It should be noted that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) have reported that, as at end June 2016, 24% of their loans (by value) were to SMEs operating in the agriculture sector.  The SBCI recently launched the &euro;150 million Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme for Farmers, which was announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Budget 2017.  This fund will provide highly flexible, low interest loans to farming SMEs, which can be used for working capital funds.  </p><p>All viable SMEs operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy and the Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.  This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks.  </p>  <p>  However, in line with Action 62 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, officials from my Department collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector. </p>  <p>  Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a key objective of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources. The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and five non-bank on-lending partners.  The SBCI has a current funding capacity of &euro;1.05 billion which it makes available to its on-lending partners as demand from SMEs arises.  To the end of September 2016, a total of &euro;458 million has been lent to over 10,600 SMEs and the SBCI has committed a total of &euro;906 million to its eight on-lending partners. In 2017, the SBCI will continue to make significant funding available to SMEs across Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Another recent initiative is the &euro;150 million Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme for Farmers announced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This fund will provide highly flexible, low interest loans to farming SMEs.  </p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people. </p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Review Office overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions.  Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services.  Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only.  The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution.  Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge. </p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.  This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges.  It is available on my Department's website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.  Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers. </p><p>The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also lists the various charges imposed by the various financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions <i>www.ccpc.ie</i></p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking. Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would again strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage.  On Monday of this week, my Department launched a media campaign as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission to raise awareness and promote customer switching in the retail financial product area.  This was agreed in the context of the restructuring plans for AIB and PTSB.  The campaign is being funded entirely by the two banks.  The campaign website <i>www.switchyourbank.ie</i>provides straightforward practical information and support on switching and I would strongly encourage people to visit it.</p></reply>

In accordance with these Relationship Frameworks the Minister for Finance has no direct function in commercial decisions made by the banks and these decisions are the responsibility of the board and management of the relevant institution.  Notwithstanding the State's shareholdings in the banks, I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to protect their value as an asset to the State.</p>  <p>  The bank informed me that their banking operation in N.Irl First Trust Bank had completed a detailed 18-month strategic review and it was to undertake a necessary reshaping and investment programme designed to ensure a sustainable future for the bank and its customers, and addressing the considerable shift in customer behaviour and their changing needs.  Since 2010 there has been almost a 40% decline in branch usage coupled with a 117% increase in mobile transactions over the past two years resulting in the decision to close a number of branches.</p>  <p>  The transformation programme will involve the consolidation of First Trust Bank's branch network with the closure of 15 branches in 2017, as well as a significant &pound;10m investment strategy for personal and business customers, including five new business centres across the province.  The bank has also agreed a partnership with the Post Office that will enable customers to conduct their everyday banking transactions in any of the 500 Post Offices across Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have been further informed that the planned changes will be managed in line with the bank's regulatory commitments and in consultation with staff and their union representatives in the Financial Services Union.  The bank's existing voluntary severance programme will be extended to impacted staff.</p></reply>

YEI funding is reserved for use in those regions, including Ireland, where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012.

Seven actions were originally selected for YEI funding, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach, Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and Momentum.  These actions are underway and are being fully funded up-front by the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  This funding is available for drawdown before the end of 2018 and while a claim for funding has not been made to date it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.  The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and will re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  The PMC has agreed in principle to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres, which are funded by the ETBs in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has advised that it obtained EU funding under the European Commission&rsquo;s call for proposals for preparatory actions under the Youth Guarantee Pilot, to pilot a Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun which operated in 2014.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.684.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800071#WRS00700"><p>On 18 January last, I announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  I also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This additional investment will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advised schools that there was no longer a requirement for schools to make applications for special education teaching supports for individual pupils with special education teaching needs, as resources would be provided for schools by the profiled allocation.</p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding year 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new allocation model for each school.</p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being devised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS).  This model will take account of the qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. </p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the pupils with newly identified Complex Needs will be included in this revised allocation. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria it is expected that allocations made to school will be sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review. </p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profiles remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. </p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs.  In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools.  Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources. </p>  <p>  The model will, however, allow for some additional provision for very exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service, being established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  A new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.</p><p>A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 Plan is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.  </p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at .</p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme. </p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage. </p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February, including the 30 schools currently in DEIS Urban Band 1 that are moving to DEIS Urban Band 1, are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy is a DEIS Primary Urban Band 2 school, which, while it caters for a significant level of disadvantage, and receive supports under DEIS on that basis,  it has not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst its pupil cohort.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  </p><p>As noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017, we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage. </p></reply>

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. </p><p>A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 Plan is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.  </p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at </p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13 February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage. </p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the two schools referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13 February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  If there are concerns in relation to the educational development of the child, the subject of the Deputy's question, I would advise, in the first instance, that the child's parents-guardians bring the matter to the attention of the Principal to discuss the appropriateness of arranging an assessment.</p></reply>

Funding supports include the Student Grant Scheme, the Student Assistance Fund, the Fund for Students with Disabilities and a number of scholarship and bursary schemes targeted at students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>In addition, the HEA allocates funding to support the work of Higher Education Access Programmes with schools.  These aim to support more students from linked schools in making the transition to higher education. Initiatives include mentoring for students in schools, support for teachers, guidance seminars, orientation and pre and post entry academic and pastoral support.</p><p>The HEA will shortly issue a call for proposals to third level institutions working with disadvantaged communities to improve attendance rates from these communities at third level institutions.  This call is the second strand of the Programme for Access to Third Level (PATH) programme which aims to support access from currently under-represented groups. </p><p>In total, my Department will invest approximately &euro;450 million in higher education access measures in 2017. </p><p>The universities also collaborate in operating the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) scheme through the CAO.  Under this scheme second level students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds are supported in competing for a higher education place on the basis of lower Leaving Certificate points. </p></reply>

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone into the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  I also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5,265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to provision for 7,542 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1,000 schools which are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  It will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools will be provided with total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need  in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  This includes provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  The model will, however, allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model. The Inclusion Support Service, established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the school&rsquo;s profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  A new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.</p>  <p>  Schools will also be provided with guidance on how to manage their resources to ensure that all pupils who have additional learning needs can be provided with support. </p></reply>

In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  I also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.

This model will take account of the qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. </p>  <p>  For the next reprofiling of the model, the pupils with newly identified Complex Needs will be included in this revised allocation. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria it is expected that allocations made to schools will be sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review. </p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profiles remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. </p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs.  In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are lower than are currently provided for, some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools.  Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources.     </p>  <p>  The model will, however, allow for some additional provision for very exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. </p><p>A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 Plan is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.  Therefore, when the profiled needs of a school indicate that they have a higher cohort of children with complex needs, the school will be supported with greater resources.</p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.  his data are combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at <i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">/</font></i><i>.</i></p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage. </p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to <i>social_inclusion@education.gov.ie.</i></p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p><p>On 18th January last, I announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post-primary schools will be introduced from September 2017. </p><p>The basic aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p><p>The profiled allocation for schools will also contain some provision to take account of social context, as part of the overall allocation.</p><p>The profiled allocation will also have account of the number of pupils with complex special educational needs in the school.  This will retain allocations for pupils with dyspraxia and down syndrome.  The Profiled Allocation will also have account of the learning needs of schools as evidenced by standardised test scores. </p><p>A new Circular and Guidance will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate, while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. </p><p>A key element of the DEIS Plan 2017 is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.</p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.  This data are combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at<i><i></i></i><i>.</i></p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February, including the 30 schools currently in DEIS Urban Band 2 that are moving to DEIS Urban Band 1, are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy is a DEIS Primary Urban Band 2 school, which, while it caters for a significant level of disadvantage, and receives supports under DEIS on that basis, has not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst its pupil cohort.</p><p>Schools, which have not been included at this stage, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest level of concentrated disadvantaged amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to <i>social_inclusion@education.gov.ie.</i></p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  </p><p>As noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective, central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017, we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p></reply>

The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.  Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings.  The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. </p>  <p>  In 2016 the issue of this limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council.

The Tribunal recommended that the income of political parties be disclosed and that political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported. </p>  <p>  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, (the 2012 Act), addressed issues that were central to the recommendations on political funding made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report.  The 2012 Act significantly enhanced the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland and brought into force restrictions on corporate donations and considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation.  The donation limit for a political party was reduced from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500, while for an individual politician or candidate it fell from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  A limit of &euro;200 was placed on donations in cash.  The threshold for the receipt of anonymous donations was reduced to &euro;100.  The donation threshold amount that gives rise to the requirement to open a political donations account was reduced to &euro;100.  Anonymous indirect donations were banned.  The threshold at which political party donations must be reported and published was reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500. </p>  <p>  The 2012 Act also provides for the disclosure and public inspection of the accounts of registered political parties.  In this connection, parties are required to have their accounts audited each year and to submit to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) an Annual Statement of Accounts and a copy of the auditor&rsquo;s report on the accounts. </p>  <p>  These requirements first applied for the year 2015 and in December 2016, SIPO furnished the Political Parties Statement of Accounts Report 2015 to the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The report with the Statements of Accounts is published on the SIPO website. </p>  <p>  The Final Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments (otherwise known as the Mahon Tribunal) published in March 2012, made a total of 64 recommendations, 10 of which were planning- related.  While some of the planning-related recommendations have already been implemented, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, published January 2016, is primarily intended to give legislative effect to the remaining planning-related recommendations proposed to be implemented.  The Bill provides for the implementation of the following recommendations:</p>  <p>- the establishment of a new independent Office of the Planning Regulator,</p>  <p>- the statutory underpinning of the proposed new national planning framework as a successor to the 2002 National Spatial Strategy, and </p>  <p>- other updates to the Planning and Development Act 2000 that are necessary to deliver greater transparency, efficiency and integrity in the planning system </p>  <p>  The Bill has commenced its Oireachtas passage and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Issues in relation to any criminal investigations arising from the Mahon Tribunal are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

Survey data gathered from each of the 31 local authorities was collated in December 2015 and the information provided by this survey indicated that, of the 5,566 developments yet to be taken in charge, there are approximately 914 estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure (DPI).</p><p>Subsequently, funding was allocated by my Department for a number of developments on the basis of proposals submitted by the local authorities.  Under the terms of the NTICI, only those developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for funding proposals, outlined in Circular FPS3 of April 2016, which is available at the following link:</p><p>It was also stipulated that funding for estates with DPI would only apply to developments that could demonstrate sustainable solutions acceptable to Irish Water and EPA.</p><p>Seven local authorities, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Tipperary and Wexford, were selected as they contained a significant number of housing estates with DPI.  In total, 68 developments with DPI were submitted by the seven local authorities for funding and 44 were initially approved. </p><p>After assessing the submissions in detail, a final allocation of &euro;1.9 million was distributed across the 7 local authorities to progress works on 31 housing estates with DPI to taking in charge standard.  Work is still progressing on a number of these pilot projects.  A further &euro;1m is being provided in 2017 to progress further works on housing estates with DPI to taking in charge standard.</p><p>My Department will prepare a report by the Summer of 2017 on key lessons learned from the valuable knowledge and experience gained under the National Taking in Charge Initiative (NTICI) which will help to inform and progress future taking-in-charge plans including for those rural estates that are served by DPI.</p><p>Further information on the NTICI can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p></reply>

On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, again in accordance with the Act, I requested the Director of the RTB to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones.</p><p>On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that 12 out of the 15 Local Electoral Areas examined met the criteria and I made Orders designating those 12 areas as Rent Pressure Zones on 26 January 2017. The areas designated included the Local Electoral Areas of Naas, Celbridge-Leixlip and Kildare-Newbridge. </p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended): </p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent in the area in the last quarter must be above the average national rent in the last quarter.</p><p>In terms of the Local Electoral Area of Maynooth, the report received from the RTB indicated that while the average rent in the area was above the average national rent for the quarter, the annual rate of rent inflation in the area was greater than 7% in only three of the last six quarters. The requirement for designation is for the annual rate of rent inflation in the area to be 7% or more in four of the last six quarters. Therefore Maynooth did not meet both of the criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Act and could not be designated as a rent pressure zone.</p><p>The reports received from the RTB in relation to the designation of rent pressure zones, including a table showing the results of the analysis carried out on the 15 proposed areas for designation, are available on the website of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) at the following link</p><p>I am fully confident that the RTB assessments are conducted in line with the legislation and accurately reflect the data gathered for compiling the quarterly Rent Index reports.</p><p>Under the Act, I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated. The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.</p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

The legislation does allow for the provision of HAP where a housing authority is satisfied that the household is unable to continue to live in a dwelling, provided under a different form of social housing support, due to exceptional or emergency circumstances.  A key principle of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice. This is distinct from RAS, which is a different type of social housing support where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. As such, unlike HAP, in general where a RAS tenancy as an allocated dwelling is ending, the local authority retains the responsibility to source further accommodation for that household. The ending of a RAS tenancy is not considered an emergency in the context of Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.</p></reply>

A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP, including the number of Rent Supplement Transfer, in each local authority area at 31 December 2016 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link</p><p>.</p><p>A breakdown of households supported by HAP within each local authority area at end of Q1 2017 will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly after the end of the quarter.</p><p>The HAP has been rolled out to local authorities on a statutory phased basis since September 2014.  As HAP is rolled out nationally, it replaces Rent Supplement for households with a long-term housing need.  My Department and the local authorities work together to help get the operation of the scheme embedded within the local authority area in a phased and organised manner. </p><p>In the early stages of HAP being made available in a given local authority area, the assessment and support of households presenting without any housing support are prioritised.  Local authorities are advised to ensure that this process is working efficiently and that the scheme is being operated well before beginning the process of Rent Supplement Transfers.  However, Rent Supplement recipients can approach their local authority to enquire about the scheme and to commence the assessment process for social housing support.  The scheme will be made available to all households in the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal County Councils with effect from 1 March 2017. </p><p>Following the commencement of the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, HAP is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list.  However, acknowledging that households on the waiting list who avail of HAP might have expectations that they would receive a more permanent form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p><p>The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.  My Department does not gather or hold any information on households seeking a transfer to an alternative social housing support whether they are currently having their housing needs met through HAP, RAS and or any other form of social housing support. </p><p>I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of the option to be placed on a transfer list.  Some 1,450 households have exited the HAP scheme since its statutory commencement in September 2014, including 240 households (at the end of December 2016) that have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support. </p><p>A local authority must be satisfied on inspection that any privately rented dwelling, including those supported under HAP, complies with the statutory standards for rented accommodation prescribed under section 18 of the Act of 1992.  The regulations that provide for these standards specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  Under section 41 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 local authorities are required to commence this inspection process within 8 months of HAP being paid in relation to a particular dwelling if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. </p><p>While in the context of policy development, my Department does consider reports of additional rental payments made by tenants supported by HAP, the number of additional payments being made by tenants is not fully known.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.  At 14 February 2017, 8.5% of the total number of households (excluding qualified homeless households) being supported by HAP had some additional flexibility applied to the monthly HAP being made to their landlord on their behalf.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme<font color="#0000FF"> </font>is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In addition, applicants under the scheme must be able to demonstrate to the Board that they have no practicable options, other than under the scheme, to secure the remediation of their homes.</p><p>A sum of &euro;22 million was announced under Budget 2017 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2017 of which &euro;3.1 million has already been drawn-down by the Housing Agency.  This allocation will build on the 553 dwellings already remediated under the scheme and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.  It is envisaged that an additional 400 dwellings will be either remediated or under remediation by end 2017.</p></reply>

These funds must be used by local authorities for housing purposes; this could include improvement works; once-off works to local authority dwellings, that might include radon remediation, or extensions/adaptations; and co-funding of improvement works programmes for which exchequer funding is also provided, such as housing adaptations for people with disabilities and elderly people.  As the housing stock and the priorities of each local authority may vary, they have discretion to apply this funding in line with their own priorities.</p>  <p>  This funding compliments the wider funding that is available through Exchequer programmes and which has been significantly increased under Rebuilding Ireland  , with some &euro;5.35 billion available to support delivery of social housing by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.  In that context, taking account of the results of the latest Statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments conducted in late 2016, new social housing delivery targets for local authorities for the period beyond 2017 will be set in Q2 this year and, in that context, the use by local authorities of available Part V funds to support their housing programmes will be considered further.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;107 million has been provided from 2013 to end-2016 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 57,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020.</p>  <p>  The insulation retrofitting programme is being implemented in a number of phases: Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and is focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties, while Phase 2 of the programme - which has been piloted in Fingal and Westmeath County Councils - will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction.  Phase 2 will be formally rolled out to all local authorities this year.</p>  <p>  Based on the most recent information from local authorities, it is estimated that there are in the region of 23,000 and 28,000 homes requiring Phase 1 and 2 works respectively.

The principle of local authorities levying rates based on an independent valuation is well established and I have no plans to change this.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for the preparation of a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  I hope to bring proposals in this area to Government shortly.   </p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Act s 2001 to 2015 the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.

It sets out over 80 actions that the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative Budgetary   measures to achieve that aim. </p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of the Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector and this was delivered, with the publication of the Strategy for the Rental Sector  , which identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely. </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure. Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of 3 years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017. </p>  <p>It is important to note that the latest report referred to in the Questions relates to rent price inflation in the period prior to the introduction of the Rent Predictability measures and the Rent Pressure Zones.  The data in the report underline the need for and the relevance of the Government's measures.   </p>  <p>  The provisions limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones apply both at the commencement of a tenancy and at each rent review.  In addition, at the beginning of a tenancy, there is a statutory obligation on a landlord in a rent pressure zone to provide a tenant with details of the rent under the previous tenancy of the dwelling, together with a statement as to how the new rent has been calculated.  The purpose of this provision is to allow a tenant to ensure that their rent complies with the legislation.  The existing prohibition on charging a rent above market rent continues to apply in all areas. </p>  <p>  The Act provides that in confirming whether or not the criteria have been met, the information relating to the area concerned must be determined by the information used to compile the RTB Rent Index quarterly report.  Statistics in the report referred to in the Question are based on asking rents for those properties which are advertised on that company's website, as opposed to the RTB figures which are based on rents paid in all registered tenancies.</p></reply>

Rather, it is a matter for local authorities to ensure the appropriate application of the Guidelines in their statutory development plan and development management processes.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Planning Framework will further develop the policy in this area, for example in relation to identifying potential to build up the population and economic vitality of city and town centre areas that in many cases have witnessed a sustained movement of people outwards to suburban and wider settings.</p>  <p>  In view of the above, I consider that there is appropriate and sufficient national policy guidance to support good higher density development proposals.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an  independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  The Act applies to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions.  The dwellings to which the Act does not apply are set out in section 3(2) of the Act, and include for example:</p>  <p>  - a dwelling that is used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business;</p>  <p>  - a dwelling within which the landlord also resides;</p>  <p>  - a dwelling the subject of a tenancy the term of which is over 35 years.</p>  <p>In these cases the RTB does not have any function in relation to the agreements or arrangements on which they are based.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where it is unclear as to whether a dwelling is the subject of a tenancy to which the Act applies, the RTB can adjudicate on the question and has done so in the past.  Where it finds that a tenancy is unregistered due to the landlord&rsquo;s wrongful claim that the Act does not apply to the dwelling, the RTB can serve a notice requiring registration and failure to comply is an offence.</p>  <p>  Where the owner of a dwelling, residing in that dwelling, lets a room, that letting is not considered to be a tenancy within the meaning of the Residential Tenancies Act.  I have no plans at this time to extend the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts to persons who rent a room in a dwelling within which the landlord also resides.</p>  <p>  However, the legislation on overcrowding of houses is laid out in Part IV of the Housing Act 1966 and applies irrespective of whether the house is the subject of a tenancy.  Under that Act, a housing authority may request information from the owner or occupier of a house such as will allow that authority to determine if a house can be deemed to be overcrowded, having regard to section 63 of the Act. </p>  <p>  The housing authority may serve notice on the owner of a house specifying the maximum number of persons that may occupy a house without causing overcrowding and, where the owner of a house is causing or permitting the house to be overcrowded, may require the owner to desist from causing or permitting such overcrowding within a period not exceeding twenty one days.  Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with these requirements is guilty of an offence.</p></reply>

The voluntary register operated by CIAT assesses and monitors the competency standards for Architectural Technologist applicants.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) formally published the national graduate standard for Architectural Technology in Ireland.

This released &euro;1.5 billion nationally for nearly 23,000 new social housing units to be delivered via a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.  Wexford&rsquo;s target is for the delivery of 677 units to the end of 2017, with a funding allocation of &euro;25.36 million.</p><p>Now, with the increased national targets under <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, increased targets beyond 2017 will be set for all local authorities.  These will be based on the results of the most recent statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments, published in late 2016, so that delivery and resources can be aligned with the up-to-date, priority housing needs locally.  I anticipate these new targets for individual local authorities will be finalised in Q2 2017.</p><p>My Department is in regular contact with Wexford County Council with a view to facilitating the early advancement and delivery of its proposals, and funding for 2017 will be provided by my Department in line with their progress.  Accordingly, rather than a pre-set allocation of funding for this year, the level of funding to be provided to Wexford County Council will be directly linked to the scale of delivery they achieve on their approved proposals. </p><p>Indeed, it should be noted that my Department has been working closely with all local authorities including Wexford County Council to facilitate and accelerate the delivery of social housing.  Wexford County Council already has a strong pipeline of construction projects in development and is being encouraged by my Department to prepare and submit additional construction proposals to further strengthen that pipeline.

This means that the same rights and obligations that are afforded to landlords and tenants in the private rented sector are now afforded to those in the Approved Housing Body Sector.</p><p>The position of AHB tenants is significantly improved by the change, which commenced on 7 April 2016, as they now benefit from the following:</p><p>- Increased security of tenure;</p><p>- Access to Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) dispute resolution procedures, including free mediation;</p><p>- Binding obligations on AHBs as landlords to, <i>inter alia,</i>register all tenancies, keep dwellings in good repair and allow peaceful occupation.</p><p>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is provided for in Part 4 of the Act and is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months, and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy continues in being for a period of 4 years from either the commencement of the tenancy or the relevant date, whichever is the later.</p><p>For existing AHB tenancies that came under the Act in 2016, the relevant date was 7 April 2016.  This mirrors how the Act was applied to existing private rental tenancies in 2004.  Therefore, all existing AHB tenancies acquired the right to Part 4 tenancies in October 2016 unless a valid notice of termination was served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months from 7 April 2016.  Where a tenant enjoys for the time being, by reason of the tenancy concerned, rights that are more beneficial for the tenant than those created by Part 4 of the Act, the application of the Act to AHB tenancies does not operate to derogate from those rights.</p><p>It is not possible to introduce legislation that operates in a way that is retrospective and therefore I have no plans to amend the Residential Tenancies Acts to allow for the date of occupation of an AHB tenancy to be considered the start date for a new Part 4 tenancy.</p></reply>

Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.</p><p>The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers-AHB or private-allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p><p>The local authorities concerned will identify a number of sites with the potential for up to 1,000 units of accommodation and will move forward, as soon as possible, to issue calls for proposals from parties interested in developing projects.

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019, in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the preceding year (i.e. 2018) and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p><p>Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites exceeding 0.05 hectares (or 500 square metres) in area which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes.</p><p>In addition, the legislation provides that reduced or zero rates of levy may apply in specific circumstances in order to help alleviate the financial burden faced by owners of vacant sites which are subject to a site loan and where the loan is greater than the market value of the site (i.e. a negative equity situation), and also where the site loan is greater than 50% of the market value of the site.  This is to ensure that the levy provisions are fair, reasonable and proportionate taking account of the difficult circumstances faced by owners who are in this position.</p><p>My Department issued general guidance in July 2016 on the implementation of the vacant site levy to planning authorities by way of Circular Letter PL 7/2016, entitled Implementation of the Vacant Site Levy, as provided for in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 , which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: . </p><p>Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019, including the revision of development plans to specify the areas in which the levy is to be applied as well as the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register.  My Department will monitor the implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used in line with its intended purpose.</p></reply>

The objective of these schemes is to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities in returning to the labour market.

As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA services has helped over 3,000 such borrowers.  People seeking to access help under the DMA MABS service do not require a voucher to do so.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS has established a national network of court mentors.  The mentors attend each listed repossession Court hearing nationwide and provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signposting them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,600 borrowers have been referred to MABS services through the court mentor service.  Borrowers do not require a voucher to access this service.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, an additional initiative was announced by Government.  The scheme, known as Abhaile, further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to defined levels of independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  Qualification for help under the scheme is based on the being (a) in mortgage arrears on their home; (b) insolvent; (c) at risk of losing their home because of their mortgage arrears; and (d) reasonably accommodated.</p>  <p>  The new services are provided by professionals drawn from one or more panels of solicitors, personal insolvency practitioners or accountants.  Professional panels consisting of qualified and regulated solicitors and personal insolvency practitioners are already in place, and an expert panel of accountants is expected to be in place by end Quarter 1, 2017 to provide specialist financial advice, where required. </p>  <p>  The scheme has been in operation since 22 July 2016 and was formally launched on 3 October 2016.  To date, 4,810 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of 3,017 principle private residences.  Of the vouchers issued to date, 3,764 relate to the provision of personal insolvency practitioner services, 925 for legal advice services on issues related to mortgage arrears, and 121 for legal aid services relating to Section 115A Appeals, as defined under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.  No vouchers have issued for accountancy services, as the panel is not yet in place. </p>  <p>  While we have already seen significant take up of the services available, it is intended that the communication campaign which I jointly launched yesterday with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald T.D., will encourage many more borrowers to come forward and avail of the free help they need to resolve their home mortgage arrears.  The campaign includes outdoor posters, radio advertisements and a social media campaign, in order to reach as many distressed borrowers as possible, with the aim of keeping individuals and families in their own homes. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion each year, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2017, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing by approximately &euro;200m year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  There are three main pensions paid by my Department to people aged 66 and over, namely the State pension contributory (which is based on PRSI contributions), the State pension non-contributory (which is based on means), and the Widows/Widowers/Surviving Civil Partners Contributory pension (which is based on PRSI contributions, and is also payable at a lower rate before 66).</p>  <p>  The State pension contributory (previously called the Old Age Contributory Pension) was introduced in 1961, and is funded by PRSI contributions, on a pay-as-you go basis.  Since its introduction, the rate of payment has been based on the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; test.</p>  <p>  These rates are banded, and those bands have been amended from time to time, most recently in 2012.  There have been no changes in the structure of the bands since then, aside from increases in the rates, which are passed on pro-rata to the reduced rates.</p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions) being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;50 million in 2017, if introduced from January 2017, and that this annual cost would rise at a rate of some &euro;10 million each year.</p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, in the period from 2000-2012, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and this was regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  Aside from the lack of equity involved, this was a significant disincentive to longer working, as in most cases, contributions paid by people in their sixties had no impact upon the rate of their State pension upon retirement.</p>  <p>  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity, than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not receive such reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a maximum rate non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension if they have the required contributions.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).  The latter payment is made directly to them, and is based upon their own means, and not their household means.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job-focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  Participants receive the JobPath job search assistance and support service for a period of 12 months (which can be extended by up to six months to allow for completion of training programmes) or until such time as they find employment whichever is soonest. If the jobseeker secures employment during this period they will continue to receive support from the JobPath providers for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment. </p>  <p>  The JobPath providers are obliged to provide a baseline level of support to each participant but are free to adapt that support in individual cases, provided that it is not unduly onerous. Where a person has transport difficulties, the JobPath Company can assist the person with travel arrangements.

These rules are provided for in very detailed Regulations [883/2004 and 987/2009].  They do not replace national systems with a single European one but, rather, provide a bridge between national systems to ensure social security protection for people when moving within Europe &ndash; that is, the current EU28, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.  This co-ordination prevents, for example, a person being left without protection or having double-coverage in a cross-border situation.</p><p>The following table details the national legislation to which the EU rules on social security coordination apply and the Irish benefits classified under each heading:<table><tr><th>Schemes</th><th>Classification of Irish social welfare schemes-benefits </th></tr><tr><td>Family Benefits</td><td>Child Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, Family Income Supplement, Back to Work Family Dividend, One-Parent Family Payment and Guardian&rsquo;s Payment [non-contributory]</td></tr><tr><td>Unemployment Benefits</td><td>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Old Age and Survivors Benefits</td><td>State Pension [Contributory], Widow/er&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s [Contributory] Pension, Guardian&rsquo;s Payment [Contributory]</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Benefits</td><td>Invalidity Pension, Partial Capacity Benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Sickness and Maternity Benefits</td><td>Illness Benefit, Maternity Benefit, Health and Safety Benefit, Adoptive Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Treatment Benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Benefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational diseases</td><td>Incapacity Supplement, Constant Care Allowance</td></tr><tr><td>Applicable Social Security Legislation &ndash; posted workers</td><td>For example, liability for social security contributions where a person<br /><br />-  Has been  posted from Ireland to the UK or vice versa;<br /><br />-  Is concurrently employed or self-employed in Ireland and the UK</td></tr></table></p><p>The Department is continuing an assessment of the implications of Brexit on these areas on a scheme-by-scheme and client basis.  This is part of ongoing Brexit analysis and scenario planning for input into larger Government deliberative processes.  Clearly, however, undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the social protection implications of Brexit will, inevitably, be informed by the UK&rsquo;s intentions in this area.  Free movement of EU workers and citizens was one of the central issues involved in the debates leading up to the UK vote to leave the EU.  Therefore, the potential social protection implications of that vote are intrinsically linked to the issues involved in the free movement of EU workers and citizens.  Until such time as the UK has itself decided what relationship it wishes to have with the EU following its withdrawal, the precise implications of Brexit for the Department of Social Protection will remain unclear.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my focus, and that of my Department, is on ensuring that these social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within the Common Travel Area on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, can be safe-guarded.</p></reply>

Limits were increased across the country, (by up to 30% in Dublin), in line with geographic variations of the rental market.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;To protect low-income families in private rented accommodation and avoid further market rental inflation.. [to]  expand access to the Tenancy Sustainment Protocol throughout the country.&quot;</td><td>The Tenancy Sustainment Service and the Protocol arrangement in place between Threshold and this Department continues to operate in the areas where housing pressures are most acute in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Galway city. In addition, the Department continues to provide flexibility in the administration of the rent supplement scheme so that tenants of the scheme are supported to retain their tenancies. Since the introduction of these flexible measures, a total of over 11,000 rent supplement households have been supported with increased rental payments.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed&rdquo;</td><td>The Social Welfare Act 2016  provides for the extension of entitlement to the Treatment Benefit and Invalidity Pension schemes to self-employed people.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;to introduce a new &lsquo;Working Family Payment&rsquo;, targeted at low-income families.&rdquo;</td><td>The Department&rsquo;s approach to developing the Working Family Payment is guided by two principles.  First, that it should ensure that work pays and that no family is better off on welfare than at work, and second, though equally important, that it will have a positive effect on child poverty.<br /><br />An open call for submissions on the Working Family Payment issued on the Department's website in January 2017.  The Interdepartmental Working Group, set up to assist the work in developing proposals, has met three times to date.  The work of the Group will also be informed by the consultation process. <br /><br />Considerable work and analysis still needs to be completed along with the consultation.  It is intended that developed proposals will be prepared for consideration in the context of discussions for Budget 2018.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; [to]  publish a dedicated &lsquo;Pathways to Work for Jobless Households&rsquo; to support jobless households into employment.&rdquo;</td><td>It is expected that a proposal in relation to this commitment will be submitted to Government by end of Q1 2017. </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;actively encourage payments at Post Offices.&quot;</td><td>All DSP staff were advised of the PfG commitment and reminded that customer wishes should be facilitated where appropriate when they wish to receive their payment at the Post Office.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme, which is providing simple microloans to members and helping to combat the use of moneylenders.&rdquo;</td><td>As of 24th February, 2017, one hundred and one  (101) credit unions, representing  two hundred and twenty (220) credit  union locations, have signed up as Personal Micro Credit (PMC) scheme participants. <br /><br />There are over 4,400 people making PMC loan repayments via deductions through the Household Budgeting facility, while others are making repayments via direct debit or standing order arrangements (numbers unknown). <br /><br />The list of participating credit unions is updated regularly on the website for the It Makes Sense loan scheme at www.itmakessenseloan.ie/participating-credit-unions and on the It Makes Sense Facebook page.</td></tr><tr><td>&hellip; invest in new services and caseworkers to support jobseekers through the network of local Intreo offices..&hellip; support a regional approach to Intreo offices &hellip; review work activation and social welfare schemes to ensure that schemes do not contain anomalies that may impact unfairly on people in rural areas, including farmers.&rdquo;</td><td>The Department&rsquo;s 62 Intreo offices are located throughout the country and are managed on a regional basis. The Intreo network is managed by 11 regional managers at Principal Officer level.  Work activation schemes are being examined to identify any anomalies that impact on people in rural areas in particular. Changes on the Rural Social Scheme and the Farm Assist scheme are set out below.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; extend the Dental Treatment Benefit under the Social Insurance Fund to reimburse the cost of some routine dental treatments.&rdquo;</td><td>Budget 2017 provided for the extension of  Dental and Optical Benefits under the Treatment Benefit scheme. Work is underway with a view to having the changes operational from October 2017.</td></tr><tr><td>&hellip;&rdquo; the Departments of Health and Social Protection [to] work together to pursue a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; to support more people to get back to work if they have an illness or disability. </td><td>A Working group was formed with the Department of Health to determine lead, scope and plan for implementation<br /><br />Meetings were held with Fit for Work coalition members, Department of Health, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Health and Safety Authority.<br /><br />An interactive forum was held in Dublin Castle in December 2016, at which it was announced that the programme would be called &ldquo;Healthy You&rdquo;. This event involved various stakeholders including Government Departments, non-Governmental Organisations, patient organisations, employers, employees, semi state organisations and insurance companies.  A report of this event is currently being prepared as a basis to initiate the second stage of the consultation process later this year.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo; &hellip;to introduce flexibility and support in the social welfare system for people with severe and enduring mental health difficulties to transition into employment by ensuring a seamless return of their entitlements should a particular employment opportunity prove unsuitable. &hellip;. [and]  &hellip;address concerns surrounding the loss of secondary benefits, so that people are always better off in work.&rdquo;</td><td>The Department now provides its full INTREO service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis. In addition, four pilot best practice Individual Placement and Support (IPS) projects have been established in Mayo, West Cork, Cavan/Monaghan and Galway in conjunction with the HSE, Genio and Mental Health Reform promoting Integrating Employment and Mental Health Support (IEMHS). The projects aim to demonstrate how existing mental health and supported employment (EmployAbility) services can fulfil the IPS model of supported employment through improved integration.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Make Work Pay interdepartmental group established under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities has also been considering a range of approaches to deliver on this commitment.  The group's report is due to be published in the near future.</td></tr><tr><td>&hellip; consolidate all means testing under a single national body ensuring a single application process for services or entitlements across all government agencies.&rdquo;</td><td>No specific developments to date.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; an increase in the Disability Benefit and Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Allowance, and Blind Person's Pension&ldquo;  &hellip;. &ldquo;increase the State Pension and the Living Alone Allowance above the rate of inflation.&rdquo;</td><td>Budget 2017 provided for increases of &euro;5 per week in the rate of weekly social welfare payments.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; support and expand supported employment opportunities and work with stakeholders to make supported employment more attractive to both prospective employers and employees.&rdquo; </td><td>The Department delivers assistance with the identification and take-up of supported employment opportunities for people with disabilities through its EmployAbility service. An evaluation of this service was completed in 2016 and made a number of proposals to improve the operation of the service. An event to consult EmployAbility companies on the review and its recommendations was held on 16th August 2016.   The Department has established a working group to commence implementation of the operational recommendations contained in the report.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; highlight incentives for employers to employ a person with a disability, roll out a national awareness campaign&rdquo;</td><td>DSP Employer Engagement promotes workplace supports for people with disabilities on an ongoing basis. <br /><br />The DSP Employer Pack contains information on supports available to people with disabilities and employers and the Department promotes incentives and supports available to employers during its annual Intreo Careers Fair and Jobs Week. <br /><br />The Department is also currently updating its employer engagement strategy, including in respect of employment services to include people with disabilities.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; fully protect the Free Travel pass for all pensioners.&rdquo;</td><td>The Free Travel scheme is fully protected.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;in recognition of the vital role of schemes such as the Rural Social Scheme, Community Employment Schemes, BTEA and Farm Assist in rural communities and in activating the unemployed, &hellip;to make suitable recommendations to strengthen provision in this area&hellip;&rdquo;</td><td>Budget 2017 provided for 500 additional places on the Rural Social Scheme.  Provision was also made in the Social Welfare Act 2016 for enhancements to the means assessment for the Farm Assist Scheme</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo; Review &hellip; the Farm Assist Scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low income.&rdquo;</td><td>Provision was made in Budget 2017 and consequently in the Social Welfare Act 2016 for enhancements to the means assessment for the Farm Assist Scheme</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; review the Fish Assist scheme in recognition of the irregular earning patterns of fishermen, in an effort to respond to difficult financial circumstances.&rdquo;</td><td>The enhancements to the means assessment for the Farm Assist Scheme, provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2016 also apply to certain categories of self-employed fishermen.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;. develop a system that fosters independence through retraining and employment &hellip;provide the resources to invest in services that protect the weakest and most vulnerable in our society from poverty and exclusion.&rdquo;</td><td>Work ongoing, notably through the implementation of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 and the promotion, monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the National Action Plan on Social Inclusion.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;carry out an immediate review of the financial supports available to the unemployed or those returning to the education system to ensure the greatest possible uptake of continuing education by eliminating current barriers.&rdquo;</td><td>Changes were made in Budget 2017 so that,  from September 2017, where a jobseeker  under the age of 26 participates in the Back to Education Allowance scheme, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment which will then be &euro;193 per week, as against the &euro;160 which they are currently on. This 21% increase represents an extra &euro;33 a week, and demonstrates the State&rsquo;s support for young jobseekers who seek to enhance their skills.<br /><br />A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will also be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September 2017. This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to education.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p><p>In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  </p><p>Reversing this measure would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time.</p><p>Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.</p><p>The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy<b>.</b></p></reply>

Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This annual figure would increase in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua.</p><p>To date, 78,000 people have started their engagement period with the service.</p><p>The service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period mid-2015 to July 2016, as a result the first groups of participants have only recently completed their engagement period with the service. </p><p>It is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases Jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service.  It will take time therefore to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.</p><p>However from 2017, the Department will publish a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having just been published recently (17th of January).</p><p>The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging.  Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job  (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed people, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.</p><p>Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement period with the service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging. </p><p>As the number of people who have completed their engagement period with the service increases the department will be in a position to provide greater granularity in the reports to be published each quarter this year.</p><p>The first report (with results together with a copy of the independent customer satisfaction survey findings for both companies) is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash;.</p><p>The service is being delivered through a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies. The companies are paid an initial registration fee and thereafter job sustainment fees only.  A registration fee may be claimed when a jobseeker has developed a personal progression plan. Job sustainment fees are payable only for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).  The Department was careful in designing the service to ensure that payments to contractors are conditional on people not just finding a job, but finding sustainable employment.  The total payments to the companies amounted to &euro;26.8m in 2016. </p><p>It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the current contracts in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.</p></reply>

Any decision to change the duration of maternity leave for families with multiple births would be the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection has responsibility for the payment of maternity benefit which is provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended). In 2017 it is estimated that my Department will spend approximately &euro;266 million on maternity benefit, in respect of an average of 22,000 recipients per week. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the maternity leave legislation provides a 26 week period of statutory maternity leave. Subject to the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory maternity leave attracts a social insurance payment of maternity benefit.  A mother can take a further 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave which must be taken immediately after the end of her 26 weeks paid maternity benefit. This period is not covered by maternity benefit but a mother is entitled to a credited social insurance contribution for each week of unpaid leave that is taken (up to the maximum of 16). </p><p>Eligible parents can also avail of paid paternity leave at any time within the first 26 weeks following the birth or date of placement of the child. Paternity benefit is available for employed and self-employed people who are on from work and covered by contributions. With the introduction of two weeks of paid paternity leave in addition to twenty-six weeks of paid maternity leave the State is offering parents potentially twenty-eight weeks of paid support.</p><p>There is a commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government (PfG) to increase paid leave for parents for the first year of a child&rsquo;s life. Work has commenced to explore the options available with discussions taking place between officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.1138.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800082#WRDD02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 to 448, inclusive, together. </p><p>The activation supports and services which are available to those who are long-term unemployed include the JobPath employment activation service and work experience and training schemes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&Uacute;S.  </p><p>The JobPath service procured by my department provides additional resources to enable it to provide a high quality, case managed employment support service.  The companies contracted to provide the JobPath service have no role or authority in relation to referrals or placements for any other activation schemes or programmes such as CE or T&Uacute;S. </p><p>Jobseekers who are already participating on a CE Scheme will not be referred to JobPath and the JobPath companies do not refer jobseekers to CE.Jobseekers can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time; this is to ensure that the best use is made of the available places and to allow the scheme and service providers time to work with the participants.  However, customers who on the date of their referral to JobPath have a written offer with a start date within four weeks for CE or T&Uacute;S will be facilitated to take up the placement.  Additionally, in a small number of exceptional cases, which are assessed on a case by case basis, my Department may facilitate a customer to move from one activation support to another. </p><p>The aim of the JobPath service, which is provided for jobseekers only, is to assist them in finding sustainable full-time paid employment by providing intensive individual support and assistance.  It is distinct from the CE and T&Uacute;S schemes which provide part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments including those on long term unemployment payments.  These schemes do not, nor are they intended to, provide full-time sustainable employment.</p><p>The referral period for the JobPath service is typically for a year.  The JobPath service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period June 2015 to July 2016; as a result the first groups of participants have only recently completed their engagement period with the service.  The numbers referred initially were low but this will increase over the next few months and those who have not found suitable and sustainable employment and exited the Job Path service will have opportunities, subject to an assessment by an Intreo case officer to apply for other activation supports such as CE and T&Uacute;S.</p><p>It is important to note, that under the JobPath service, jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  The first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  It will take time therefore to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period) for complete and robust outcomes data to be available.</p><p>From 2017 onwards, my Department will publish a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having just been published recently (17th of January).</p><p>The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging.  Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed customers, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.  These outcomes refer to full time jobs (over 30 hours per week) only. </p><p>Given that only a small number of customers have completed their full engagement period with the service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging. </p><p>As the number of customers who have completed their engagement period with the service increases the department will be in a position to provide greater granularity in the reports to be published each quarter this year.</p><p>The first report (with results together with a copy of the independent customer satisfaction survey findings for both companies) is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash; </p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  The companies are paid registration fees and job sustainment fees.  A registration fee may be claimed only when a jobseeker has developed a personal progression plan.  Job sustainment fees are payable for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).  The total payments to the JobPath companies amounted to &euro;26.8m in 2016.</p><p>It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The UN has estimated that 100,000 people are facing starvation, with a further one million people on the brink of famine.  Three UN agencies have also warned that urgent action is needed to prevent more people from dying of hunger.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided &euro;39 million in humanitarian assistance for South Sudan since 2012.  Our assistance is focused on saving lives and alleviating the suffering of the South Sudanese people through meeting their immediate and most basic needs, providing food and livelihoods assistance, treating acute malnutrition, providing shelter and enhancing their protection.  In 2016 alone, Ireland contributed just over &euro;11 million to South Sudan.</p>  <p>  In view of the rapidly deteriorating situation this year, we have released &euro;265,000 for South Sudanese refugees in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for internally displaced persons in South Sudan.  Further assistance is now being planned to support the humanitarian and emergency response operations of our UN and NGO partners on the ground. </p>  <p>  The concern is shared strongly at EU level.  On 21 February 2017, the European Commission announced an emergency aid package of &euro;82 million which is aimed at addressing the urgent humanitarian situation in the country. Since December 2013, the EU Commission has provided &euro;381 million in humanitarian funding, which, including vital assistance for internally displaced people, refugees, returnees and other vulnerable people. </p>  <p>  In addition to our humanitarian assistance, Ireland and our EU partners have issued strong political statements, most recently through the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016, condemning the outbreak of violence in South Sudan, and clearly stating that there can be no military solution to the crisis.  The Conclusions called on all parties to observe the ceasefire in full and to take the decisive steps necessary to end the conflict.  The Conclusions also underlined the need for a political solution through the implementation of the existing peace agreement, agreed in 2015, and urged the Government of South Sudan to work with regional and international bodies such as the UN, the African Union and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development to resolve the political crisis.  The EU also called on all parties to allow the full, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to all those in need, which is essential in order to save lives. </p>  <p>  At the UN level, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on South Sudan at the Special Session of the United Nation&rsquo;s Human Rights Council, stressing the need for all parties to end the conflict and respect international humanitarian law in December 2016.  At the Universal Periodic Review of South Sudan in November 2016, Ireland requested that the South Sudanese authorities provide unimpeded humanitarian access to vulnerable populations. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation closely, with our EU partners, through our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, and our Embassies in Kampala and Nairobi.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the UK&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from the European Union has not to date been an item on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC).  Although formal discussions on Brexit have not taken place at the FAC, I have since June spoken at least once with each of my EU Foreign Minister colleagues on the issue of Brexit, over the course of more than 35 engagements; my programme of meetings continues in the weeks ahead.</p>  <p>  Protecting the peace process and Northern Ireland is one of the Government&rsquo;s four headline priorities in dealing with the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The established framework for all engagement on Northern Ireland is the Good Friday Agreement.  This has been strongly reaffirmed by the Government and the British Government following the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty, registered with the United Nations and it provides for a unique political and constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland, which is the foundation of the peace process.  This is something the European Union as a whole has long recognised and supported.     </p>  <p>  On 23 February, the Taoiseach held a very positive meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at which the Commission President expressed his support and solidarity with Ireland in dealing with the challenges of Brexit, including to uphold the Good Friday Agreement and seek the maintenance of the open border.  The Taoiseach will have a further round of meetings in Brussels this week, when he will meet with President Tusk of the European Council and Michel Barnier, Chair of the European Commission Taskforce. </p>  <p>  On 30 January, the Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister May the serious implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the imperative of retaining the open border on the island of Ireland.  There will be a need for the British Government to reflect the unique challenges Brexit poses for Northern Ireland in the position they adopt in the negotiations with the EU27.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that there are entirely unique circumstances in respect of the island of Ireland that must be taken account of in the negotiations for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union and the future EU-UK relationship.  While the Irish Government is actively seeking recognition and accommodation of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, our extensive discussions with partner governments across the EU &ndash; including the UK - have made clear that concepts and terms like &ldquo;special status&rdquo; give rise to serious concerns for other EU partners about precedents that might be set elsewhere.  This would risk undermining the Government&rsquo;s efforts to specifically address and mitigate the very real impacts facing our island &ndash; and the people of Northern Ireland in particular - due to Brexit. </p>  <p>  While I entirely understand the rationale of those seeking a &ldquo;special status&rdquo; designation, the fact is that such a proposal would unnecessarily distract from work to secure arrangements which reflect the genuine uniqueness of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s situation, founded in the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, as well as its geographic status as the only land border between the UK and the EU27.</p>  <p>  On 21 February, I outlined to the House the need for specific, effective, and realisable measures that could address the major issues of concern under Brexit, whether these relate to the border, or to the citizenship, constitutional and human rights provisions of the Agreement, or otherwise.  The Government will also be advocating for the continuation of the range of EU policy supports to Northern Ireland and the peace process, including in relation to EU funding and is looking at existing precedents and potential innovative approaches in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with our EU partners and EU Institutions and prepare comprehensively in support of our overall negotiating objectives.</p></reply>

The issuing of 42 new Stop Work orders, and military activity in the area, has given rise to fears that a mass eviction and demolition action against the village was being planned.</p><p>There has been a strong international response to this threat, in which Ireland has taken an active part.</p><p>In October 2016 the Irish and other EU Heads of Mission in Palestine visited Khan al Ahmar to demonstrate support, and show that the actions of the authorities there were being scrutinized. </p><p>In response to the recent increased threat, there have been strong statements on the case from the relevant UN agencies on the ground, and from the EU representative.</p><p>The Irish Ambassador in Israel has made a demarche at a senior level in the Israeli Foreign Ministry, drawing attention to the threats and expressing the strong concerns of the Government in relation to the threats of demolitions, contrary to international law.</p><p>The Irish Representative in Ramallah will be joining other EU Heads of Mission in a further visit to the community in the next few days.</p><p>The most recent reports suggest that the threat of demolition may not be as imminent as was feared.  The prompt attention to the case may have helped in this regard.  Ireland&rsquo;s missions in the area will keep this case under close observation.</p></reply>

This support has been based on clear reasoning and analysis of the various options and alternatives, and those reasons remain valid, despite growing concerns about the possibility of achieving such a solution. <br /><br />The inescapable fact is that a two state outcome remains better than any other model that has been considered, and is the only one which can deliver peace, security, freedom and justice for both Israeli and Palestinian peoples. <br /><br />An acceptable one state outcome could only be on the basis of full equality between all those living under its jurisdiction. Any belief that it will be possible instead to simply continue a version of the present occupation would be wholly unacceptable.<br /><br />The recent remarks of President Trump have stepped back from the clear support for the two state solution which previous Presidents have given, but without putting an alternative view in its place. The Administration has yet to enunciate a considered policy for the Middle East. I hope very much that when it does so, it will recognise the logic which has guided US policy for many years.<br /><br />For our part, the European Union has made clear that our support and advocacy for a two state solution remain unaltered. The strong international consensus on this basis was expressed only last month at the Paris Conference, which I attended, and in Security Council Resolution 2334 in December. We will continue to represent this view in our discussions with the new US Administration, bilaterally and at EU level, and in international fora such as the UN and the Quartet.</blockquote></reply>

However, as yet, no details of a potential reform package have been formally announced by the US Administration.  Any reform would have to be agreed by the Administration with both Houses of the US Congress.</p>  <p>   In the absence of any detailed proposal by the US authorities, it is not possible to assess the likely effect of a reform, nor the likelihood of a legal challenge.

This inspection could be carried out at any time during their period in office and for a defined period thereafter.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a detailed review of the current statutory framework for ethics was undertaken by my Department.  This included examination of the recommendations of the Mahon and Moriarty Tribunals and other relevant recommendations, as well as international best practice.  On foot of this examination, the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 was drafted and published on 23 December 2015.  It completed second stage in the D&aacute;il on 20 January 2016.  This Bill is now scheduled to recommence at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 6 April with a view to enactment by the summer.  </p>  <p>  The approach adopted in the Bill aims to secure the relevant objectives of the Tribunals to significantly strengthen the regulatory framework for the effective management of conflicts of interest and for minimising corruption risks.  It is strongly guided by the analysis and findings contained in the Tribunal reports.  In this context the proposed legislative reforms include, for example, a significant broadening of the material and personal scope of declarations of interest, increased frequency of declarations where changes have taken place and broadening and significantly enhancing the powers of the regulator for the ethics system.  The proposals draw on the Moriarty recommendation and make provision for the regulator to carry out "own initiative" investigations which would encompass the Moriarty recommendation relating to voluntary audits.</p></reply>

The briefing highlighted the progress of the study to date.  It indicated that, based on initial site visits, the area appears to be constructed on soil with high porosity and there is a need therefore to conduct a geotechnical investigation of the site and a geotechnical assessment regarding the seepage characteristics of the soil both along the river bank and along the hill to the front of the properties in Tullybeg, Ballinhassig. </p>  <p>  The progression of the study and the cost of a possible project are dependant of the results of this geotechnical investigation which will be undertaken by specialists following a public procurement process.

Long experience shows that access to the Skellig in the early part of April is highly difficult and OPW works staff are not guaranteed to be able to consistently access the Island with any certainty at that time.  While occasionally all weather and sea conditions can be relatively benign and works completed earlier than planned, these occurrences are very much the exception.  The experience of OPW Management over many seasons operating at Skellig has been that in the majority of years, works would only be completed and access to the public permissible by the middle of May.</p>  <p>  As Skellig Michael is an international destination which draws visitors from many countries, it is necessary to announce the opening date at least 4 &ndash; 6 weeks in advance.  It is not feasible, given the unpredictability of sea and weather conditions, the lead times involved in works, contracting Guide staff, completing safety training with local emergency services etc., to announce an earlier date which has a practical degree of certainty.</p></reply>

The Commission's remit does not extend to considering the position of retired public servants. </p><p>The Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies as a progressively structured imposition on public service pensions in payment to retired public servants under terms set out in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act  2010, as amended. PSPR is being significantly reversed in three stages under FEMPI 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When fully rolled out from 1 January 2018, the changes will mean that all public service pensions with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.

Following these assessment processes 56 projects are being funded. </p>  <p>  This capital scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.

Financial support is provided through a number of structured schemes for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments. </p>  <p>  Both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2017 and the Structures at Risk Fund 2017 are open for applications throughout the month of February.  Applications are made via the relevant local authority.  Details of the schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and each local authority will have details of the application process for their areas on their own websites. </p>  <p>  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2017 is for the repair and conservation of structures that are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  The scheme aims to support a significant number of labour-intensive, small-scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craftspeople and tradespersons in the repair of the historic built environment.  I understand that the building in question was in receipt of grant funding under the scheme of just under &euro;10,000 in 2016. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund 2017 helps with conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund is again administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties, and give support to owners/occupiers in their long-term commitment to securing the future of the architectural heritage which might otherwise be lost. </p>  <p>  My Department also funds the Heritage Council, which provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  They have just announced their Community Heritage Grant Scheme 2017, which is open for applications from 1 March 2017. Information on the scheme is available on their website.  </p></reply>

Good progress has been made to date in terms of launching Ireland&rsquo;s first Arts in Education Portal,  holding National Arts and Education Days and developing Teacher Artist Partnerships through the Education and Training Centres.  Indeed, the research report into exploring Teacher-Artist Partnership as a Model of CPD for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education in Ireland will be launched tomorrow in the Department of Education and Science. </p>  <p>  The Arts Council's ten-year strategy - Making Great Art Work 2016-2025 - places specific emphasis on the need to plan and provide for children and young people.  The strategy also commits to working to achieve full implementation of the Arts in Education Charter. Arising from the significant increase of support of &euro;5m which I secured for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017, I am pleased to say that Arts Council funding in this area for 2017 has in turn increased from &euro;3.1m in 2016 to &euro;3.7m this year.  This is a very clear indication that the Arts Council is prioritising arts participation by young people and children.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the Charter, the Creative Ireland Programme,which the Taoiseach and I launched in December, places a special focus on &ldquo;Enabling the Creative Potential of Every Child&rdquo;. Building on the Arts in Education Charter this will involve the development of an integrated plan to enable every child in Ireland to access tuition in music, drama, art and coding by 2022.  My Department will be working with relevant Departments and other stakeholders over the coming months to develop this plan.  </p></reply>

Ancillary activities included a broad range of actions, such as equestrian centre and riding school projects.  In light of the considerable level of investment already undertaken in ancillary activities under the previous programme, it was decided that support for such activities would not be eligible under the 2014-2020 LEADER programme.

Provision is made in the Revised Estimates Volume for the capital carryover amount by subhead and in a Ministerial Order to be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before 31 March in the year of carryover.  The making by the Minister of this Order renders capital expenditure on the programmes, which have been included in the Order, a first charge against the carryover amounts for those programmes.  As such a Ministerial Order has not yet been made in 2017, no expenditure has been incurred by my Department this year against capital carryover.</p></reply>

This Review commenced on 28 August 2015, and is being conducted by a Team external to the Executive.  It was initially envisaged that the Review would be completed by March 2016.  Given the scale of the Review, and the legal and other complexities involved, the Team sought extensions to the original timeframe for the Review. I understand that a Report on this matter will be delivered to the HSE in the near future.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>- the health needs of the public;</p><p>- the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>- the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>- the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>- the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>- the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>- the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>- the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>- the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June of last year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at:<i>.</i></p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement and is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by HSE Drugs Group which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.</p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.  The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 days period (from the formal written notice of proposal) to enable the pharmaceutical company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so.  The HSE is legally required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.</p><p>Therefore as the statutory process is still on-going the Company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE. </p><p>In relation to the compassionate access scheme operated by the manufacturer, CSL Behring, I note and welcome the decision of the Company to extend the scheme by a further two months.  However it is important to point out that the operation of such compassionate schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers. I as Minister for Health have no role in the operation of these schemes.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need. </p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access for patients already being treated with a new medicine with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical and that manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially-motivated manner.</p></reply>

The model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally.  Government policy is therefore to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide optimal clinical outcomes.  Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise.  Tri-location with paediatric services ensures immediate access on-site to paediatric services when foetal or neonatal surgery is required.  The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high risk mothers and babies.  </p>  <p>  The project to redevelop the National Maternity Hospital will progress to planning stage very shortly.  The other three maternity hospital projects are at a very early development stage and it would be premature to provide any indicative time frames for completion, or cost estimates, at this point.  Costs will of course differ from project to project and will be determined, in part, by any requirement to upgrade facilities at the host hospital.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p>  <p>  1. the health needs of the public;</p>  <p>  2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p>  <p>  3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p>  <p>  4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p>  <p>  5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p>  <p>  6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p>  <p>  7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p>  <p>  8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p>  <p>  9. the resources available to the HSE. </p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. </p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi and Kalydeco.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  The statutory process is still ongoing but I expect it can be concluded in a period of weeks.</p></reply>

Those with the greatest clinical need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE.  It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to provide timely access to orthodontic care, the HSE has undertaken a procurement of orthodontic services with a number of private service providers.  Those patients who have been waiting over four years have been contacted first, followed by those waiting three years or more.  This initiative commenced in April 2016.  By the end of 2016, 1,889 patients had been contacted and 1,238 accepted transfer from HSE to a private orthodontic provider.  By virtue of this outsourcing initiative, it is not envisaged that the Waiting List initiatives due to be implemented by the NTPF and the HSE under its Waiting List Action Plans will include orthodontic care.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also considering changes in skills mix to assist in providing timely access for patients.  This involves using orthodontic therapists working under the supervision of specialist orthodontists.  Two orthodontic therapists are in place and a further two are in training and the HSE plan to extend this initiative.</p>  <p>  Orthodontic treatment is included in the list of treatments available under the Cross Border Directive.  Patients may access orthodontic treatment outside the state, and can be reimbursed by the HSE. Further information on this is available on the HSE website.</p></reply>

However, the Act provides that the Minister may, by regulation, designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is appropriate and in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  The regulation of a new profession under the Act involves a consultation process and the making of a number of statutory instruments by the Minister for Health and by the relevant registration board.</p>  <p>  Over the past few years, a number of professional bodies have met with the Department of Health, at both official and ministerial levels, to convey their views on options to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists.  In September of last year, the Department engaged in a formal consultation process in which interested persons and organisations were invited to formally submit their views on how the statutory regulation of the profession(s) should proceed.  A total of 84 submissions were received by the closing date of 30th November 2016.</p>  <p>  I am undertaking an examination of these submissions which will inform the approach to be adopted in progressing the statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors.</p>  <p>  I envisage that the next steps in the statutory regulation of the profession(s) under the Act will commence in the coming months with the submission of draft designation regulations to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  While the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist are not currently designated under the 2005 Act, counsellors and psychotherapists are subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.  There are also various regulatory controls on many counsellors and psychotherapists operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The profession of psychologist, for example, is a designated profession under the 2005 Act which means that those psychologists who are counsellors and/or psychotherapists will begin to be regulated when the Psychologists Registration Board, which is due to be established during this year, opens its register.</p>  <p>  Psychiatrists, some of whom practice psychotherapy, are regulated under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Also, counsellors/therapists working in the publicly funded health sector are required to have minimum qualifications set by the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</p></reply>

The circumstances where the statutory in-patient charges cease are where the patient is either, "(i) upon a registered medical practitioner having the authority to make such a decision in the hospital concerned determining that the person concerned no longer requires acute in-patient care, or (ii) where the person is otherwise discharged as a patient from the hospital."  In these circumstances, the hospital may make charges under Section 53(A) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Section 53(A) of the Health Act 1970 allows an acute hospital to charge a patient who no longer requires medically acute care the average cost of public long term residential care.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query on hospital charges raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.  </p></reply>

Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 100 die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p><p>Although there is no scientific basis to recent claims about the vaccine, this has led to a reduction in uptake rate of the vaccine from a high of 87% in the 2014/2015 academic year to 72.3% in the 2015/2016 academic year.  Figures released by the HSE indicate that the uptake rate for the current year may be even lower.  The first round of the 2016/17 HPV vaccine schedule has been completed with preliminary uptake figures of 40-50% in all Community Health Organisations.  </p><p>The focus for the HPV programme in 2017 is to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of the HPV vaccine, and to increase the uptake rate in girls as part of the schools immunisation programme.  </p><p>In the spring of 2016, the HSE began consulting with stakeholders with an interest in HPV/cervical cancer to explore ways of tackling negative publicity and misinformation.  The HSE and Irish Cancer Society (ICS) agreed to take a coordinated approach to correcting HPV vaccine misinformation.  The HSE and ICS worked closely over the last few months to develop plans and schedule activities.  As a result, a two pronged approach was agreed between the ICS and the HSE which has been implemented since before the start of the 2016/17 HSE vaccination programme in September.  The HSE took a number of actions which included providing information to all school principals, management bodies and National Parents Councils, and meeting with the Department of Education and Skills and school management bodies.  </p><p>The 2016/17 HSE vaccination programme started in September 2016 and parents of girls in first year of second level school were given an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter with contact phone numbers for their local immunisation office.  Since then, the following actions have been taken:</p><p>- Inclusion of new section on HSE websites &ndash; 12 key facts about HPV vaccine which address specific issues raised by anti-vaccine groups</p><p>- Short information videos developed for HSE website.</p><p>- Articles written in publications for health care professionals</p><p>- HSE social media campaign underway</p><p>- Ongoing interviews for radio, TV, press and online</p><p>- Collaboration with ICGP in production of e-learning modules on HPV vaccine &ndash; now available on ICGP website</p><p>- Liaison with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Pharmacy Union to promote HPV vaccine and articles written for their websites and publications</p><p>- HPV vaccine meeting held with health representatives of all parliamentary parties and interested public representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (arranged by the Irish Cancer Society and attended by the HSE)</p><p>- Presentation at the National Parents Council AGM on HPV vaccine safety</p><p>- Attendance at World Health Organization meeting with Danish Health authorities and international experts to discuss strategy to manage decline in HPV vaccine uptake</p><p>- Attendance at WHO HPV Prevention and Control Board meeting and seeking further information from partners in countries who have similar difficulties</p><p>- Presentation at the ICGP winter scientific meeting on HPV vaccine safety</p><p>- Ongoing training sessions across the country for HSE vaccination teams, GPs and practice nurses</p><p>- Ongoing liaison with the Irish Cancer Society, National Cancer Screening Programme, National Cancer Control Programme, the Marie Keating Foundation and the Irish Family Planning Association</p><p>- Ongoing liaison with the Department of Education and school management bodies.  </p><p>Since November 2016, the following additional actions have been taken:</p><p>- Teleconferences with Principal Medical Officers ongoing to review programme and plan for 2nd round of immunisation and the 2017/18 campaign</p><p>- Meeting with Department of Education</p><p>- Ongoing meetings with key stakeholders including Royal College of Physicians Ireland and UK colleagues (no drop in uptake in Great Britain, possible drop in Northern Ireland border counties)</p><p>- Presentation at Faculty of Public Health Medicine Winter Scientific meeting on &ldquo;HPV vaccine-separating fact from fiction&rdquo;.</p><p>- Results of focus groups on HPV vaccine parents attitudes and experience led to changes to information materials and parental letters for 2nd round  2016/17 (to be sent to all parents to allow parents who wish to change their mind and consent to vaccination)</p><p>- Launch of HPV vaccine safety and effectiveness lesson for Transition Year Students as part of Science and Technology in Action.</p><p>- European Cervical Cancer Awareness week 23-27 January 2017</p><p>- Twitter hour on HPV vaccine 25 January 2017.  </p><p>The following actions are planned or underway:</p><p>- Focus groups with parents</p><p>- Enhanced programme for administration for Dose 2 HPV vaccine</p><p>- Planning for 2017/18 HPV vaccination campaign</p><p>- Offer 1st dose of vaccine to those who refused it in March /April 2017 (as part of 2nd round)</p><p>- Implement comprehensive communications plan targeting those more likely to refuse vaccine and using results of social media analysis</p><p>- Meet with management bodies, parents&rsquo; councils and unions of primary and post primary schools</p><p>- Send revised information leaflet and  consent form to parents of first year students</p><p>- Develop and send information to 6th class primary school parents</p><p>- Continue engagement with national and international stakeholders- Review information materials and plan for 2017/18.  </p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  The parents of all eligible girls are strongly encouraged to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

This will include staffing, quality assurance, education and training, and branding.  In addition, staff of the main hospital will rotate through the centres.</p><p>Each centre will provide urgent care as well as secondary outpatient services including rapid access general paediatric clinics.  The aim is to improve geographic access to urgent care for children in the Greater Dublin Area and support primary and community care paediatrics, as well as reducing Emergency Department and outpatient attendance at the main site.  The satellite centres at Connolly will be<font color="#2F2F2F">easily accessible to local populations for the management of minor illness and injuries and attendance at outpatient and chronic disease clinics.  </font></p><p>Each centre will provide consultant-led urgent care from staff of the new children&rsquo;s hospital with observation beds (4-6 hour) and appropriate diagnostics.  Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care attendances per annum.  </p><p>The provision of general paediatric rapid access clinics will meet the need of primary care for access to specialist opinion (secondary paediatric opinion)-currently many children are referred to tertiary specialists when they don&rsquo;t need that level of expertise, resulting in longer waiting lists.  The satellite centres will also provide general community and paediatric clinics including developmental paediatrics, multidisciplinary care for children with chronic stable conditions and other outpatient services.  Each centre is expected to cater for a minimum of 15,000 outpatient attendances per annum.  </p><p>Child sexual abuse unit examination, observation and therapy rooms will be provided in the satellite centres.  The satellite centre at Connolly will also include two HSE paediatric care primary care dental services operating theatres.  </p><p>I intend to bring a Memorandum to Government on the new children&rsquo;s hospital in the coming weeks.  It is intended that the contract for construction of the main hospital and satellite contracts will be awarded end Q1 2017, subject to all necessary approvals.  The transition of services to the new children&rsquo;s hospital is scheduled to commence in Q3 2021 with transition of services to the satellite centres commencing in Q3 2018 for Connolly.</p></reply>

The process for this is described in the &lsquo;Guide to the Notification System for Exempt Medicinal Products&rsquo; which is available on the website of the HPRA.  For this notification scheme, there are a number of specialist wholesalers which deal with the importation of &lsquo;exempt medicines&rsquo; into Ireland, via pharmacies and subject to a prescription.</p>  <p>  The responsibility for the clinical use of exempt medicinal products lies with the prescriber.  In accordance with the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics, medical practitioners must ensure as far as possible that any treatment, medication or therapy prescribed for a patient is safe, evidence-based and in the patient&rsquo;s best interests.  This applies equally to licensed and unlicensed medicinal products.</p></reply>

The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  As such, it allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU or EEA (excluding Switzerland) Member States that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation</p>  <p>  Therefore, as this drug is not currently available within the public health system in Ireland, it would not be possible to avail of it abroad under the Cross Border Directive.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country.  The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  Previous engagements have resulted in a number of service developments including the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes, an enhanced support framework for rural GPs, and a revised list of special items of service under the contract to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting.  These measures, combined with the under-6s and over-70s universal GP care initiatives, have increased the financial support for general practice. </p>  <p>  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and initial engagement  with GP representative bodies began in January.  As with any negotiation-type process, and given the range and complexity of the issues to be discussed, the engagement may take some time.

The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing.  The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) advice is that there should be no targeted fisheries in 2017 and 2018 and that any possible provision for landing of bycatch should only happen as part of a management plan.</p>  <p>  While I note the anecdotal reports on increased numbers of Picked Dogfish, the Marine Institute fully supports the ICES advice and has very serious concerns about the state of the stock.  Given such robust scientific advice, there does not appear to be a case for the re-opening of a commercial fishery for Picked Dogfish at this time.</p>  <p>  The TAC and quota Regulation for 2017 (EU Regulation 127/2017) lists Picked Dogfish as a prohibited species and has a prohibition for EU fishing vessels to fish for, retain on board, to tranship or to land picked dogfish, with the exception of fish caught by a vessel engaged in a by-catch avoidance programme that has been positively assessed by European Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).</p>  <p>  The EU Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Picked Dogfish is  set at 270 tonnes for 2017 with 53 tonnes available to Ireland.  This quota is only available under EU law where a by catch avoidance programme, as approved by the STECF, is in place.</p>  <p>  Under an approved avoidance programme, vessels under the programme may land not more than 2 tonnes per month of picked dogfish that is dead at the moment when the fishing gear is hauled on board.</p>  <p>  I have now asked the Marine Institute to design a pilot project on such a Picked Dogfish by-catch avoidance programme for consideration by my Department.  It will then have to be considered and approved by STECF before a limited number of vessels will be able to participate.  It is intended that this pilot programme  will further increase our knowledge of the stock, aid in its recovery and help ensure its long-term sustainability on the basis of firm scientific evidence.</p></reply>

In that context, it runs commercial operations in a number of greyhound stadia, including Harold's Cross.</p>  <p>  In 2014, against the background of reducing income for the organisation through the recession, and a significant debt burden, my department commissioned an independent report into certain matters relating to Bord na gCon, including its financial performance and prospects.  That report provided a road map for the sustainable development of the greyhound sector, and in that context recommended a number of asset disposals, including Harold's Cross Stadium, in order to reduce that debt burden.</p>  <p>  I understand that Bord na gCon, in view of its substantial debt burden, having considered the matter and having regard to the recommendations in the Indecon Report, has decided to cease racing at Harold's Cross and initiate the sale of the stadium in order to reduce its debt levels and increase its capacity to provide support and assistance to the industry.</p>  <p>  While this is very regrettable, its view is that there is no other option if the burden of debt on the organisation is to be reduced in any meaningful way.  I understand that its intention is to transfer the Harold's Cross racing schedule to Shelbourne Park, a few kilometres away, and that all 12 staff at Harold's Cross will be offered redeployment.</p></reply>

The criteria set out in the legislation are:</p><p>- Low temperature </p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture </p><p>- Limited soil drainage </p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness </p><p>- Shallow rooting depth </p><p>- Poor chemical properties </p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.  This analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel, be subjected to a refinement process.</p><p>Once this process is completed over the coming months, the draft data will provide the basis for the identification of eligible areas for ANC.  It is envisaged that stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops.</p></reply>

The report proposes an all Wicklow approach to tackling the impact of deer on bovine TB and to the management of a cull.</p>  <p>  I should explain that, while I am aware of the concerns expressed by farmers in the Wicklow area about the negative impact of deer on the incidence of TB in the area and on pasture and forestry, responsibility for wild deer rests with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  However, both our Departments have been actively engaging with stakeholders in the area and we have decided on a number of initiatives aimed at addressing these issues,  particularly in relation to the potential impact of the high density of deer on TB levels in the county.</p>  <p>  In light of the findings of earlier research which revealed a high incidence of TB in deer in the Calary area of Co. Wicklow, a Steering Group was established in late 2016 to oversee a reduction in the deer density in that area.  The Group is comprised of representatives of local farmers, the Irish Deer Management Forum (IDMF), the Wicklow Deer Management Partnership (WDMP), the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts Heritage, regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Steering Group has appointed a local co-ordinator to manage the project. The co-ordinator is responsible for organising local hunters to implement the density reduction programme, liaising with landowners in the area, collecting and storing samples for scientific analysis and reporting regularly to the Steering Group on progress. Funding for the project has been made available by both Departments.</p>  <p>  My Department is also in the process of organising a wider study on the prevalence of TB in deer in Wicklow as a whole. Samples will be collected from culled deer across the entire county and will be subject to detailed analysis with a view to determining the linkage between TB in deer and TB in cattle in the area. In addition, my Department is funding a proof-of-concept pilot deer fencing project to demonstrate to farmers how fencing may prevent deer from gaining access to lands.  </p>  <p>  In addition to dealing with the deer problem, my Department has increased the intensity of its approach to the management of bovine TB in Co. Wicklow.  All TB breakdowns in cattle herds are investigated by veterinary staff from the local offices and there is increased usage both of tuberculin and blood testing for TB in order to try and get ahead of the infection cycle.  Extra staff has been assigned to the badger programme and last year more badgers were removed from Co. Wicklow than from any other county apart from Cork.  The incidence of TB in West Wicklow has fallen by over 30% to date this year while TB levels in East Wicklow are currently only slightly higher than in the rest of the country.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these initiatives will assist in addressing the issues raised by the Group in its interim report.</p></reply>

Specifically, in 2013 Ireland joined with other Member States in a statement emphasizing the importance of having regard to human rights and self determination in terms of the implementation of the agreement</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to be a firm supporter of the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara and the Government remains firmly committed to this principle.  Previously, the advice of the Council&rsquo;s Legal Service has been that the FPA with Morocco did not entail a de jure recognition of Morocco&rsquo;s legal rights in respect of the area.  Therefore there was no conflict between Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Western Sahara and its support for the agreement.</p>  <p>  Eleven Member States, including Ireland, are allocated fishing opportunities under this agreement.  Ireland receives a quota of 2,500 tonnes each year in the FPA&rsquo;s industrial pelagic category.  All applications to fish under this FPA are submitted to the European Commission via my Department.  No Irish fishing vessel has sought to avail of these fishing opportunities or operate in Moroccan waters under this FPA since 2007, 10 years ago. </p>  <p>  This FPA is continuously monitored by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council.  As part of the agreement, Morocco must provide regular, detailed reports on the use of the financial contribution for the fisheries sector, including the economic and social benefits on a geographical basis.  There is also a mechanism for the possible suspension of the agreement, including in the event of violations of human rights and democratic principles.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the judgement by the Court of Justice of the European Union dated 21 December 2016.  The Department is not aware of any statement from the European Commission or the Council to date regarding the Court judgment or any indication of any plans to introduce amendments to the existing fisheries protocol in place between the European Union and Morocco.  My Department will continue to monitor this issue closely.</p></reply>

This equates to more than one new scheme every month and no other country in the EU has come close to this level of delivery.  Ireland has so far drawn down some 32% of its allocated funding for the period of the programme.  In contrast the average EU drawdown to-date stands at 14%.  Ireland has delivered at nearly 2&frac12; times the European average.  Also as an example, Northern Ireland has just this month launched its first agri-environmental scheme under the CAP 2015-2020 Programme.  Ireland has already successfully launched three GLAS schemes and two Organic Farm schemes.  This rate of delivery could only have been made possible by the availability of very dedicated delivery teams and high quality ICT systems which have provided excellent support in the operation of the schemes.</p>  <p>  GLAS payments underway since December 2016 represent the first full year payment schedule under the GLAS scheme.  More than 28,000 participants in the scheme received 85% of their payment totalling almost &euro;100 million before the end of last year.  To date 30,700 participants have been paid which represents 83% of total scheme participants.  Payments runs will continue on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  The majority of the outstanding applications involve cases where the computer system has discovered issues which by their nature require manual intervention to resolve.  These applications require further investigation and are being gone through on an individual basis.  These cases, many of which are quite complex to resolve or require further feedback from the farmer, can take a considerable effort to resolve.  They are being addressed with the greatest urgency possible to ensure that the farmer gets paid as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that everything is being done to ensure the earliest possible resolution of these cases.</p></reply>

It is not within the gift of individual Member States to amend these rules. </p><p>However at the request of Ireland and some other Member States, the EU Commission introduced a provision last year permitting payment of the levy in three annual instalments, without interest.  This was on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in 2015.  Ireland was one of the few Member States to implement this scheme and make it available to our farmers.  The farmers who applied are currently in their final year of repayments.</p><p>There are a number of other initiatives at industry<b>,</b>national and EU level aimed at mitigating market volatility in the dairy sector.  The EU Commission has responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures provided for under the CAP.  Market difficulties continued into the middle of 2016 and the Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council in July.  The main component is a fund of &euro;500 million.</p><p>The main element of the EU July 2016 package is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes<b>,</b>which Member States can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  As part of Budget 2017 I announced a new low cost loan fund for the livestock<b>,</b>including in particular dairy<b>,</b>as well as tillage sectors which will utilise Ireland's &euro;11.1M allocation<b>,</b>in conjunction with national funds, to leverage a greater fund in the region of &euro;150M to provide such a low cost loan model for Irish farmers.</p><p>The market returns to Irish dairy farmers are also starting to show improved returns over the last few months and the outlook for 2017 is more positive than last year.  I am monitoring this market situation closely as I am aware that the recovery is still somewhat fragile and will remain in close contact with stakeholders as the year progresses.</p></reply>

The European Investment Bank and Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) recently announced a new initiative expected to support &euro;112 million of new investment in privately owned forests across Ireland.  Since the 1980's over 19,000 unique private forest owners have received grant aid from the State to establish forests, the average size of which is 9.1 hectares.  This announcement will help bring more of these forests under a single management plan and in doing so help address the economy of scale issue that is associated with the fragmented nature of Ireland&rsquo;s private forest estate.</p>  <p>  While the announcement by the EIB provides an option for some private forest owners it is important that those owners who wish to retain and manage their own forests are also supported.  In this regard the Department has signed a contract to develop a certification template to assist forest owners in achieving certification for their forests.  Two certification groups will also be established as part of this exercise to help reduce the cost for those wishing to certify their woodlands.</p></reply>

The prosecution of infringements which are an offence under national legislation, implementing EU fisheries regulations or otherwise are carried out on behalf of the State by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>  <p>  Article 18 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 provides that a Union fishing vessel subject to Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) shall not be allowed to leave a port without a fully operational satellite tracking device installed on board.</p>  <p>  Article 20 of that Regulation provides inter alia that the master of a Union fishing vessel shall ensure that satellite tracking devices are fully operational at all times. </p>  <p>  In relation to frequency of data transmission and reporting intervals, Article 22 of that Regulation provides that each Member State shall ensure that its Fisheries Monitoring Centre (FMC) receives at least once every two hours, through the Vessel Monitoring System the required information.  It further provides that the FMC may require that information at shorter time intervals. </p>  <p>  The Naval Service acts as the official agency with responsibility for the operation of Ireland's FMC.</p></reply>

However, it remains open to a company to continue to offer waste collection on a pay-by-weight basis.  Many companies already had a pay-by-weight element to their charging structure before the agreement was reached and many of their customers had opted for this approach. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing, together with the regulatory authorities and industry representatives, the introduction of an incentivised pricing system for household waste collection. Incentivised pricing aims to encourage people to prevent, reduce and segregate their waste, to reduce our reliance on landfill for waste disposal in light of the landfill capacity emergencies that occurred in 2016, and also facilitates the industry in providing people with a range of options to manage their waste costs. The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered as part of the review.</p></reply>

These wholesale, open access fibre networks are operated and managed in a commercial manner, on behalf of the State, by a Managed Services Entity (MSE), enet.  Currently, over 65 licensed telecommunication operators use the MANs infrastructure, with some 2,500 connections to the MANs.  The number of end users served by these service providers is a matter for the individual telecoms operators.  However, it is estimated that in excess of 600,000 business users and individuals are benefitting from the MANs, including industrial estates, multinationals, SMEs, State entities, educational institutions, together with fixed and mobile customers outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  In the case of County Monaghan, 11 service providers utilise the MANs infrastructure at Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Clones and Monaghan town to provide retail services to their respective customers. </p>  <p>  A Cost Benefit Analysis study and a Value for Money review of the Phase I MANs were carried out a number of years ago.  More recently, my Department concluded an internal review of the MANs Programme in autumn last year.  This involved a detailed retrospective review of the performance of the MANs in terms of the delivery of their policy objectives, an identification of the challenges facing the MANs, and an assessment of their ongoing relevance in the current telecommunications market.  </p>  <p>  The review found that the MANs have played, and continue to play, an important role in driving competition in the regions and attracting foreign direct investment to the cities and towns where they are located.  The creation of the MANs as an exclusive fibre network facilitates service providers, large and small, in responding to the ongoing growth in demand for bandwidth capacity. The MAN infrastructure remains central to the telecommunications market in regional Ireland.</p></reply>

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p>  <p>  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland. The Taskforce report is available at the following link:www.dccae.gov.ie/communications/en-ie/Pages/Publication/Report-of-the-Mobile-Phone-and-Broadband-Taskforce.aspx. </p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys has established two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services. Since July, there has been significant progress made in discussions with the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p>  <p>  I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017. This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p>  <p>  These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.1970.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800103#WRZZ01700"><p>For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has a Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) emissions reduction target under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) No. 406/2009/EC. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008 -2010. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels, depending on whether additional policies or measures beyond those already in place by the end of 2014 are implemented. On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2eq). According to the latest inventory published by the EPA in November 2016, GHG emissions for 2015 are estimated to be 59.84 MtCO2eq. This is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, the shortfall to 2020 projected by the EPA reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the decade between 2008 and 2019 due to the economic crisis (including the impact of the troika programme and the EU fiscal governance requirements), and the fact our 2020 target was very significantly above what would have been cost-effective for Ireland to contribute to the overall EU effort. It now represents a significant challenge to be addressed, including as we look out to 2030. It will be necessary, therefore, to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned as part of the development of the National Mitigation Plan, if we are to address this gap to target. </p>  <p>  In the first place, this will include the retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexibility Mechanisms carried forward from 2008-2012 which can be offset against the deficit. If this does not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased. It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase  notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  There are c.60,000 premises in County Louth, of which approximately 15,000 are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.  The remaining 45,000 premises are located in the commercial blue area and will be served by commercial operators. </p>  <p>  The eircodes referred to by the Deputy fall within the AMBER area and will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.</p>  <p>  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p>  <p>  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland. The Taskforce report is available at the following link:www.dccae.gov.ie/communications/en-ie/Pages/Publication/Report-of-the-Mobile-Phone-and-Broadband-Taskforce.aspx. </p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys has established two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services. Since July, there has been significant progress made in discussions with the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p>  <p>  I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017. This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p>  <p>  These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country including County Louth.</p></reply>

Since 2007, the harvest of salmon, by commercial fishing and recreational angling has been restricted to those rivers that are meeting their individual conservation limits for wild salmon.</p>  <p>  Research into salmon genetics indicates that each of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river as mature salmon to spawn and propagate the next generation of salmon distinctive to that river. </p>  <p>  The harvesting of salmon either by recreational anglers or commercial draft net fishermen is only considered in rivers where the estimated salmon returns are above the conservation limit for any particular river.  The conservation limit for any river is the number of adult spawning fish required to maintain a viable and sustainable salmon population. </p>  <p>  The status of the stock in each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 designated salmon rivers, sections of rivers and estuaries is reviewed annually by the Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) comprised of Scientists from a range of organisations.  The independent scientific advice provided by the Committee underpins the management decisions made by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) in respect of the opening or closing of a river for angling and commercial fishing for salmon on an individual river basis.</p>  <p>  The annual Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations, made under the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, provide for the management of Ireland's wild salmon and sea trout fisheries by IFI.  Specifically, the Regulations provide for the quotas of fish (surplus to the conservation limits) that can be harvested either commercially or by rod and line from those rivers identified in the Schedule to the Regulations. These Regulations are revised each year taking account of advice from IFI, the Standing Scientific Committee and any submissions received during a 30 day statutory public consultation period.</p>  <p>  In assessing the status of salmon stocks for any particular river, the Committee draws on a number of data sets including rod and commercial catch data, fish counter data and the results from catchment wide electro-fishing.  The SSC provides advice for the purposes of wild salmon and sea trout management for the river system in question based on fish counter data. </p>  <p>  The fish counter on the river referred to by the Deputy continues to indicate that the conservation limit for wild salmon is not being met.  However, the SSC carried out an additional assessment via catchment-wide electro-fishing to establish the presence of juvenile fish.  On the basis of this assessment the river is currently open for Catch and Release angling.  </p></reply>

Under the Better Energy Homes (BEH) scheme, the grant available for an oil or gas boiler upgrade is limited to &euro;100, a small contribution, and is only available when the upgrade is carried out along with the installation of heating controls. Heating controls are an extremely effective way of saving energy and using less fuel.  The incentive of a grant for a new boiler is aimed at making the public aware of the grant supports available from SEAI and introducing them to the much wider set of energy efficiency measures they could undertake with SEAI support. SEAI are, at present, carrying out a full review of the technologies that are supported under the BEH scheme.  This will consider the range of technologies that are available to deliver energy savings and look at where Government support will be most effective.</p>  <p>  While the Better Energy Programme has been extremely successful in encouraging homeowners to carry out energy efficiency works, the majority of savings have come from lower cost, more accessible measures such as attic insulation and energy conservation campaigns.  Tackling these easier, cheaper measures first is a sensible approach and it has done a great deal to raise awareness of energy efficiency.  Now, with the aim of putting Ireland on realistic trajectory to 2030 and 2050 climate and energy targets, as outlined in the recently published National Mitigation Plan briefing document, the depth of energy efficiency upgrades needs to increase.</p>  <p>  Under the Better Energy Communities  (BEC) scheme, renewable energy heating systems are already supported. Heat pumps and biomass boilers are being grant funded this year at up to 50% (or up to 95% for fuel poor households) when carried out with a combined fabric upgrade.  Promoting a &ldquo;fabric first&rdquo; approach reduces heat losses, makes it easier to keep a home warmer and more comfortable for longer periods and reduces the likelihood of installing an oversized heating system. </p>  <p>  Experience from the BEC scheme, as well as from various pilot schemes I will roll out this year, will be used to form an evidence base to inform future national policies on low carbon heat and create the business cases necessary for large-scale projects to apply for EU funding, which my Department will be seeking to avail of in the coming years.</p>  <p>  One of these pilot initiatives will, for example, offer deep energy efficiency upgrades to people currently participating in the Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme.  Families who become involved in this pilot can expect to experience warmer, more comfortable homes, significantly reduced energy bills, a higher property value and even improved health and wellbeing.  From Ireland's national perspective, it will lower Ireland&rsquo;s CO2 emissions, support local construction industry jobs and contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets. </p>  <p>  More widely, the pilot will serve as a demonstration to the families throughout Ireland who are dependent on solid fuels as their primary heating source that there are alternatives, that energy efficiency can deliver real benefits and that moving away from solid fuels will be of benefit to them and the country as a whole.  My officials are working closely with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the SEAI on the design of this scheme and full details will be announced shortly. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-28a.1997.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022800104#WRAAA01200"><p>I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Any customer, including those in Leitrim village and the surrounding areas, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p><p>The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by ComReg.  I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.  However, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.  The rate of demand for data services has increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.</p><p>Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites. </p><p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.</p><p>  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. </p><p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>  In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p><p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. </p><p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment plans have not been fully demonstrated. </p></reply>

Smarter Travel's overarching goals remain the cornerstone of my Department's transport policy.  This is recognised and reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government where we commit to ensuring that the &euro;3.6bn investment in the public transport system provided for in the Capital Plan will uphold the principles of <i>Smarter Travel</i>.</p><p>The Capital Plan also specifically commits &euro;100m in funding for smarter travel and carbon reduction measures.  In addition significant funding is also provided to the National Transport Authority (NTA) on an annual basis for the delivery walking and cycling infrastructure in the GDA and the Regional Cities.  This is delivered through the Regional cities grants programme and the Sustainable Transport Measures Programme and behavioural change programmes such as Workplace and Campus travel programmes and the Green Schools Programmes.</p><p>The most recent Canal Cordon Report revealed a significant increase in the numbers cycling and walking into Dublin City Centre.  We are now seeing more than two thirds of people using sustainable transport modes to enter Dublin in the morning peak.  The focus in 2017 will be to continue on this trajectory and review the effectiveness of  the funding programmes delivered to date along with reviews of the Smarter Travel and National Cycle Policy Frameworks to inform future investment decisions.</p><p>In order for Ireland to effectively and equitably contribute to the EU emissions reduction commitments in line with the Paris Agreement and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, an ambitious low-carbon development strategy is being developed.  Responsibility for emissions reduction is of course a collective one and Ireland's EU emission reduction targets are national and not sectoral in nature.  When all sectoral inputs, including transport, have been co-ordinated, the draft mitigation plan will be available for extensive public consultation before being submitted for approval to Government.</p></reply>

In addition, the Strategy indicates that the public transport needs on the Swords/Airport to City Centre corridor may require a higher level of public transport capacity than the existing provision, both in advance of the delivery of new Metro North which is anticipated to be completed in 2026/27 and also to serve areas south of the M50 subsequent to the implementation of new Metro North.  The NTA has indicated that this additional capacity may take the form of a BRT service, a BRT-type service or a conventional QBC upgrade.  Any final arrangement would be designed to be complementary to the new Metro North scheme.</p>  <p>  The NTA is currently in the process of preparing an Implementation Plan for the delivery of the strategy for the period 2017-2022.  Key to implementation over this period is the capital funding that will be available for investment in public transport infrastructure over the period.</p>  <p>  Funding is being made available for initial planning and design work for the Blanchardstown to UCD and Clongriffin to Tallaght BRT schemes under the Government's Capital Plan 'Building on Recovery Infrastructure &amp;amp; Capital Investment 2016 - 2021'.  I understand from the NTA that a contract has been signed with a design team to carry out a route options analysis study to identify the preferred route option for the Clongriffin to Tallaght Scheme.  The NTA also issued tender documents to progress the design and planning of the Blanchardstown to UCD Scheme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a mid-term review of the Capital Plan has been initiated and I will be making the case for increased funding for public transport in that context to cater for increasing demand for public transport as the economy continues to improve and to encourage people to get out of their cars and onto public transport and more sustainable forms of travel.</p></reply>

The increase in the number in employment has impacted on transport through the beginning of a recovery in public transport numbers, but also through increased car use and the re-emergence of peak period congestion.</p>  <p>  With regard to the M50, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), along with other stakeholders are continuing to implement a number of measures on the M50 to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency, including: changes to merge and diverge layouts at junctions; the introduction of permanently signed emergency routes; increased incident access points; increased provision of incident response units; and enhanced interagency co-ordination to improve incident management.  TII have also established a project team to manage the design and procurement of a system of mandatory variable speed limits for the M50 and will progress this project in 2017.</p>  <p>  Insofar as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has overall responsibility for the implementation of their published Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  My Department is working closely with the NTA with a view to intensifying efforts to combat congestion across Dublin in the short to medium term through greater use of bus priority, demand management and other alleviating measures.  I expect this work will help to strengthen the case for increased public transport investment, as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Government's Capital Plan in 2017.</p></reply>

Our proposals will address the issue of employees on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week but whose contracts do not reflect the reality of their hours worked.  The proposals will also seek to ensure that employees are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and their core terms at an early stage in their employment.</p>  <p>  The policy response to the Programme for Government commitment is being informed by the University of Limerick study on zero hour contracts and low hour contracts as well as the extensive material and practical examples provided by respondents to the public consultation on that study conducted by my Department.</p>  <p>  Developing policy proposals on employment rights is a complex matter.

It is important to remember that case was referred in relation to interpretation of the EU Directive on Working Time (2003/88/EC).  In the Tyco case, the CJEU found that where workers do not have a fixed or habitual place of work, the time spent by those workers travelling each day between their homes and the premises of the first and last customers designated by their employer constitutes &lsquo;working time&rsquo;, within the meaning of the Directive.  The workers in that case installed security alarms in provincial Spain.</p><p>The primary purpose of Working Time Directive is to make provision for the protection of the safety and health of workers and is given effect in Irish law by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (as amended).  There is no amendment of that Act required by me to enforce the Tyco decision.  </p><p>It should be noted that that the Working Time Directive does not apply to the remuneration of workers.  Employers are free to determine the remuneration for time spent travelling between home and customers, a point made by the CJEU in the Tyco case.</p><p>What is referred to in Section 8 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (as amended)  is 'working hours'<b></b>for the purpose of remuneration rather than working time for the purpose of health and safety which is what was considered in the Tyco case.  Consequently, it does not follow that any amendment of national legislation dealing with remuneration is required by virtue of the Tyco case.  Working hours has a very different statutory meaning in the context of national minimum wage legislation.  It is important to remember that this is legislation that did not emanate from the EU.</p><p>Therefore, there is no necessity for me as Minister to amend legislation to determine the national minimum hourly statutory pay for employees  on the basis of the Tyco decision where both the facts and the law were very different to what is covered by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 as amended.</p><p>While it is correct for the deputy to point out that the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 states that working hours does not include time spent travelling to and from work, it would appear to be open to an employee in the particular circumstances of the Tyco case (worker does not have a fixed or habitual place of work and must travel each day between their homes and the premises of the first and last customers designated by their employer) that they are at work during this time. </p></reply>

As a result of this process, in January 2005 the Department of Health and Children published "adoption Legislation: 2003 Consultation and Proposals for Change".  The Report has served to inform the legislative developments that have taken place since then in particular the Adoption Act 2010 and the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016.</p>  <p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has operational responsibility for adoption in Ireland. In this regard I am advised by the Authority that it is proactive in its consultation with stakeholders.  The Authority continues to meet with various stakeholder groups on a regular basis.  These include Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, and the various Bodies accredited to provide adoption services and various country-specific adoption support groups (e.g. Viet South and the Irish Chinese Contact Group).</p>  <p>  I am also advised that during 2016, the CEO and/or members of the Authority's Senior Managemnet Team met with the Adoption Rights Alliance, irish Foster Care Association, Children's Rights Alliance and Treoir.  The Authority also resumed meetings "on circuit" which allowed it to meet locally based groups, e.g. 'Know My Own' (Cork), the Sligo Family Resource Centre and Danu.  The Authority intends to meet with local adoption groups in Galway and Waterford later this year.  Furthermore the Authority has held a variety of seminars involving all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to establish the stakeholder adoption advisory groups but I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me advised of any issues which arises in their consultation.</p></reply>

On foot of this, my Department has initiated an awareness campaign targeting homeless families through Focus Ireland and other community and voluntary groups which come into contact with families on a regular basis; and targeting childcare providers to encourage uptake through Pobal and through the Dublin based City and County Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently developed information literature in the form of leaflets in order to raise awareness of the programme among the public.  These leaflets are presently being distributed by Focus Ireland and the four Dublin Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  Focus Ireland have supported and provided the appropriate forms to 42 children to enable them access the programme.  My Department is also currently in consultation with local authorities to roll out the programme nationwide.</p>  <p>  I am confident that this programme will meet its objectives with regard to supporting homeless families and I am hopeful that through the measures my Department has taken to increase awareness that we will see increased uptake in the coming weeks and months.</p></reply>

While under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Grant Funding Agreement, registered childcare providers must ensure that pre-school leaders hold a at least a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 6 on the NFQ. </p>  <p>  This particular service provider runs a pre-school in a rural area in Co Limerick.  She made an application to my Department for qualifications assessment last year.  The ultimate outcome of this application was that she met the minimum  requirements under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, and not the minimum requirements under the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that this service has no member of staff who meet the requirement for a room leader at the standard capitation rate for ECCE (i.e being a relevant major award at Level 6 or more on the NFQ).  Following a direct appeal by the service provider, my Department permitted her to run the ECCE programme for the 2016 / 2017 programme year, as an exception to the usual Grant Funding Agreement requirements.  This was permitted on a one-off basis and this is the only provider within the ECCE scheme for whom this temporary exception was made. </p>  <p>  In allowing this exception, my Department was mindful that this service is in a rural area, which lacks many alternatives for pre-school provision.  Also, I understand that when the qualification assessment was communicated to this service provider, it was nearing the end of the 2015 / 2016 programme year, and she had many bookings already for the 2016 / 2017 programme year. </p>  <p>  My Department took into account the service provider's situation specifically that the local community would have very little time to make alternative arrangements, given the lack of ECCE services in the area.  The service provider was clear that it was her intention to retire following the 2016 / 2017 programme year, but that she wished to offer the 2016 / 2017 ECCE year in order to facilitate and support the local community and give adequate notice that her service would not function beyond this time. </p>  <p>  In view of the circumstances, and to support the service provider's efforts to provide an ECCE service for her community for a further year, an official from my Department wrote to her and stated that she would be allowed to deliver the ECCE programme for the 2016 / 2017 programme year. However, this situation as it stands cannot be allowed to continue beyond that time frame under any circumstances.</p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that my Department cannot allow services which are not compliant with the contractual requirements, under the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement, to continue to remain within our programmes. Therefore there can be no flexibility on the outcome of this service provider's qualification assessment unless she adjusts the staffing in her service to meet the contractual requirements of the ECCE programme.  If she does not employ a room leader with the appropriate qualification, she will not be allowed into contract for the 2017 / 2018 programme year.</p>  <p>  I would also like to inform you that my Department has no prior knowledge that this service provider is a retired primary school teacher, and has received no documentation to that effect.</p></reply>

In this regard, the level of remuneration in the Defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other related public sector employments.   </p>  <p>  I fully appreciate that many of our citizens continue to face some difficulties in the current environment, including members of the Defence Forces.  The Government is making every effort, within available resources, to support all those who face hardship.  In addition, there are various schemes in place through the Department of Social Protection, including Family Income Supplement, to support those on low incomes. </p>  <p>  The circumstances surrounding an application for Family Income Supplement, or indeed any other scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection, is a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Social Protection.

It was agreed between the parties that the best way to approach the review was through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Civil Service and any agreement reached would then be applied across other parts of the Public Service.</p>  <p>  Following agreement, on the 23 April 2015 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued circular 05/2015 implementing revisions for civil servants.  By way of letter to this Department, dated the 15 May 2015 from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the revisions were to be applied to the Defence Force Personnel with effect from 1 July 2015.

One aspect of the payment of subsistence in a timely manner is dependent on the correct information being set out on the claim.  Claims are validated against the appropriate procedure.  In some circumstances where additional information/ original receipts is required, this may result in the processing of the payment being delayed until the matter is clarified.  Staff of the Department often act in a guidance role providing claimants with information regarding what they need to provide in order for a claim to be processed and for payment to issue in a timely manner.</p></reply>

The Survey was commissioned on foot of a recommendation in the third and most recent Report of the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG).  A similar survey was conducted in 2008 and in line with that survey, approximately 11% of Defence Forces personnel were sampled on this occasion.</p>  <p>  The key findings of the Survey are grouped under topics such as Work Life Balance, Peer Support, Organisational Justice (within the Organisation), Procedural Justice, Organisational Fairness, Defence Forces Integrity and Supervisory Justice.  The Survey findings clearly point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personal expectations.  While there are areas of concern raised by the survey which need to be addressed, there were also many positive sentiments expressed in relation to the commitment of personnel to the values of the Organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the Organisation and positive views on culture and peer support.   </p>  <p>  The responses to the issues raised in the Climate Survey resulted in the formulation of an Action Plan which is being led by the Chief of Staff and involves engagement by all levels of management within the Defence Forces communicating effectively and knowledgeably with the personnel working to them.  I have met with the Representative Associations to hear their views and concerns in relation to the Report.  It was agreed at that meeting that the Representative Associations would be fully engaged in the response to the Report and the proposed action plan through the IMG Framework where they can put forward their views on appropriate responses.   </p>  <p>  The initiatives in the Action Plan included the conducting of additional Focus Group Surveys in order to provide further information on conditions within the Defence Forces, the implementation of White Paper projects relating to Human Resource issues, the continuation and improvement of Exit Surveys, the improvement of the Defence Forces internal communications plan and the adoption of an integrated competency framework.  The conduct of Focus Groups will provide for the collection and analysis of qualitative data to complement and further inform the quantitative nature of the Climate Survey findings.   </p>  <p>  A total of seventy three (73) Focus Groups have recently been conducted throughout the Defence Forces.  The Focus Groups were grouped by rank, based on the findings of the Climate Survey research and were held at every permanently occupied Post and Barracks in the Defence Forces and in UNDOF on the Golan Heights.  A very significant volume of raw data has been gathered for analysis.  The University of Limerick (UL) researchers have indicated that Focus Group analysis will be provided in Quarter 2/3 2017.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges facing the Organisation, I believe that we now have the structures in place to not alone address low morale in the Defence Forces but to deliver a more effective, energetic and sustainable Organisation into the future.</p></reply>

The question of the publication or otherwise of the final report will be addressed once I receive same but I can assure the Deputy that any recommendations contained in the final report will be acted upon to ensure the safety of the men and women of the Air Corps.   </p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied with regard to the impartiality of the independent person appointed to investigate the allegations made in the protected disclosures to which the Deputy refers.</p></reply>

A report entitled &quot;Irish Air Corps Safety Management Review&quot; was completed in November 2013 and it contained a number of recommendations.  The following table indicates those recommendations which have been completed or are in the progress of being completed. <table><tr><th>Recommendations </th><th>Status </th></tr><tr><td>The GOC sets-up an annual Risk Assessment Review Board to re-examine all records of risk acceptance to assess the validity of the risk assessment and mitigating measures. The Risk Assessment Review Board shall be chaired by the GOC or a suitable delegate. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC revises policies related to risk acceptance within the Irish Air Corps so proper risk mitigation be documented as appropriate and residual risk accepted at an equivalent level. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC indicates in Operations Orders the risk index assigned to the operation/exercise. If the risk is assessed as being above Acceptable Level of Safety Performance then the Operations Orders shall indicate the mitigating measures in force and stipulate by name, rank and position the officer who is accepting the risk during the exercise/operation. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC ensures safety specialists receive appropriate training in SMS related to safety programs, standards and safety expectations. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC with the Internal Safety Management System Officer develops and endorses an organisational policy outlining in simple terms the duty of employees to report mandatory and near-miss events through the guiding principles of 'Just Culture'. The policy should articulate what are reportable safety occurrences, the obligation to report and the implications of not reporting. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC stresses and develops policies outlining the obligation of personnel towards safety reporting, stressing the personal obligation to report near misses and the liabilities associated with failing to do so. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC mandates the Internal Safety Management System Officer to organise one major Emergency Response Plan exercise per year, alternating between a command post exercise and a realistic simulation testing the full capabilities of the Emergency Response Plan. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC promulgates the Irish Air Corps Emergency Response Plan and ensures the plan is reviewed periodically. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC liaises with Department of Defence to put in place common procedures for the documentation of hazards and management of risks. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC revises the Sortie Risk Assessment Form to ensure appropriate hazard identification and risk quantification before each sortie and that sortie risk be accepted by an appropriate command authority if risk is above Acceptable Level of Safety Performance. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC reviews SRAFs for suitability and puts in place processes for the proper transfer of accountability </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The ISMSO, or in his/her absence, the Air Corps Flight Safety Officer should conduct a random review of High Risk Sortie Risk Assessment Forms to ensure standardisation between units and enhancement of processes. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC consolidates Quality Assurance audits to minimise impact on units and centralise the follow-up on corrective measures. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC or appointed senior officer acting on his behalf oversees an IAC safety committee responsible to review safety policies, safety actions, safety concerns and standards within the Corps. The committee should also monitor other activities having an impact on safety like risk assessments, intelligence, and future flight data following, and Flight Data Monitoring programs etc. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC conducts a thorough risk assessment of strategic threats and implements suitable mitigating measures. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC takes steps to qualify a cadre of personnel in risk assessment and put together a program to familiarise personnel with risk assessments. The training shall be widespread in the Corps to include Unit Flight Safety Officers, authorisers, unit commanders and key members of the Senior Management Team. </td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC puts in place a communication strategy to create a positive safety climate and inform personnel on strategic plans to counter threats to the Irish Air Corps. </td><td>In Progress </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC designates on an interim basis suitable facilities that will be used as Corps HQ for the control of a complex emergency situation and considers the creation of a suitable permanent facility </td><td>In Progress </td></tr></table></p><p>The report also contained additional recommendations which are being considered in the context of a wider project to set out options for an Air Safety System within the Defence Organisation.  A joint civil/military working group has been tasked with responsibility for this and a project plan has been developed and is currently being progressed.  Those recommendations are set out in the following table.  <table><tr><th>Additional Recommendations</th></tr><tr><td>The GOC in consultation with the Air Corps Flight Safety Officer instigates a program of safety communications to enhance organisational safety knowledge, understanding and feedback using 'Just Culture' as primary building block </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC develops processes for the conduct of independent safety investigations involving key personnel within a unit/wing/Corps for events where the reputation of the Irish Air Corps Safety Program could be affected if the investigation was conducted internally </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC puts in place processes to audit the Corps Headquarters functions. </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC seeks legal expertise to assess regulatory obligations of implementing an Irish Air Corps Safety Management System. </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC formally puts in place an Irish Air Corps Safety Management System by appointing an Internal Safety Management System Officer who would facilitate on his behalf a common and standardised Safety Management System Program. This Internal Safety Management System Officer should not hold other positions or responsibilities that may conflict or impair his/her independent role as Safety Manager. </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC reviews the control processes related to executive decisions made on safety recommendations, tracking to completion and analysis of their effectiveness of preventive measures. </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC articulates clearly the responsibilities of the different safety programs and the associated safety officers. </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC engages in a process with the Department of Defence and Military Police for the production and enforcement of a Military Aviation Protocol for dealing with safety occurrences involving human error. The guiding principles of 'Just Culture' shall offer protection against prosecution for self-reporters whilst also enabling prosecution of personnel where wilful acts are committed. </td></tr><tr><td>The GOC considers the creation of a liaison cell in the Department of Defence Headquarters to ensure proper alignment of policies, doctrine, operations, personnel and safety. The cell to be effective shall be manned by a promising senior officer of the Irish Air Corps with an equivalent staff capable of representing the views of the GOC and the Irish Air Corps to the Higher Headquarters.  </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  On each occasion that the support of the Defence Forces is required, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a form C70 to the Defence Forces to request their assistance.  Since 5 February 2003, the Garda&iacute; have requested support from the Defence Forces at Shannon Airport on occasion.  An increase in the number of Defence Forces deployments may occur for two reasons.  Firstly, an increase in the number of requests from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and secondly, the length of time an aircraft is on the ground.  As a deployment is a 12 hour shift, a single aircraft on the ground for an extended period, perhaps overnight, would involve more than one deployment of troops per request.   </p>  <p>  During the month of April 2016 the Defence Forces received 26 requests from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this involved 47 deployments.  Similarly, the Defence Forces received 25 requests in October 2016 and this involved 46 deployments.</p></reply>

Ireland has benefitted to date from participation in a number of EDA projects which include<b>:</b></p><p>- A project, (now completed) in relation to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Protection.  This is a key capability area for the Defence Forces.  Participation in this programme and access to the results of the research, studies and development work packages undertaken by the programme enables the Defence Forces to remain at the leading edge of capability development in this key area.  The countries that Ireland collaborated with on this project were Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.</p><p>- A project (now completed) in relation to Maritime Surveillance (EDA MARSUR).  This programme furthered developed the Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) exchange network technology that allows for the sharing of information amongst the wider EU defence community in support of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy and the EU Commission initiative to establish a Common Information Sharing Environment.  The countries that Ireland collaborated with on this project were Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom.  Ireland is participating in a follow on &ldquo;MARSUR&rdquo; project Ireland's designed to provide ongoing life cycle support for the existing MARSUR capability through provision of adaptive maintenance, enhancement and technical support.  This project, which commenced in November 2016, will run for three years.  The countries that Ireland will be collaborating with on this Category B project are the same as for MARSUR with the addition of Portugal.</p><p>- A project relating to training in Manual Neutralisation Techniques was set up in 2014.  Manual Neutralisation is a method used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD) Operators where complex explosive devices have to be neutralised manually and where it is not possible to use remote or semi remote techniques such as robots to render the device safe.  The project will run for four (4) years.  The countries that Ireland is collaborating with on this project are Austria, Germany, Italy and Sweden.</p><p>- Also since November, 2016, Ireland has participated in a project in relation to Cooperation on Cyber Ranges in the European Union.  This projects aim to maintain and improve cyber resilience as well as the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of Member States' personnel in the area of cyber security and defence.  The countries that Ireland will be collaborating with on this project are Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.</p><p>Opportunities will continue to be identified to expand Ireland's participation in multi-national capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability.</p><p>Ireland's cooperation with NATO is conducted through the Partnership for Peace (PfP) which we joined in 1999 following approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Ireland's purpose in participating in the PfP is to improve Defence Forces capabilities and to ensure that our Defence Forces are interoperable with the forces of other States engaged in UN mandated crisis management operations. Participation in PfP provides us with opportunities to avail of joint training with other countries and to access courses provided by the NATO schools.</p><p>Ireland has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence which provides a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence.  The MoU takes into account matters such as military forces training; exercises and military education; exchange of views on EU Common Security and Defence Policy; potential for joint contributions to UN Crisis Management Operations; joint procurement initiatives; pooling and sharing resources; general sharing on reform in defence services; potential for staff exchanges; sharing of information, and joint contribution to Security Sector Reform and capacity building in crisis locations.  It envisages cooperation and exchanges involving both civil and military personnel.  The MoU provides opportunities for more joint and collaborative work in support of international peace and security.  It will also enhance the potential for further joint contributions to UN peacekeeping operations.</p><p>It is paramount that the Irish Defence Forces are equipped to carry out their roles at home and overseas.  Therefore, there has to be particular focus on developing capabilities, exploring pooling and sharing opportunities and undertaking joint training with other countries.</p></reply>

To this end, it is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way.  A claim was received from Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA), for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994, as the first effects of this agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, would be felt by the Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks in 2015. </p>  <p>  As it was not possible to reach full agreement in this matter, an adjudication hearing took place on 30 January 2015.  The findings of the Adjudicator's report were noted and the report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 4 March 2015.  The contents of the report have been accepted by PDFORRA and the Department. </p>  <p>  My officials are examining the necessary measures to implement the Adjudicators findings.</p></reply>
