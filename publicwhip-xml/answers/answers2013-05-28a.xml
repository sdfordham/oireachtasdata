In addition to the wide range of cross-cutting policy structures and forums for engagement on enterprise skills needs, such as the National Competitiveness Council and the Innovation Task Force, direct advice from enterprise informs the development of education and training policy on an ongoing basis.  The F&Aacute;S Strategic Labour Market Unit and Expert Group on Future Skills Needs inform the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, e.g. Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion initiative, which was introduced as part of the ICT Action Plan.</p></reply>

As part of existing arrangements short-term support is provided to schools that are dealing with particularly acute incidents that arise due to tragic accidents, bereavements etc. Short term support has been allocated to 5 schools in such circumstances in the current school year.  It is important to note that the provision of guidance in schools is a whole school activity. Since the start of the current school year guidance provision is delivered from within each school's standard staffing allocation. I have already acknowledged to the House that bringing guidance within quota is challenging for schools. However the alternative was to adjust the PTR staffing allocations. The budget decision sheltered the impact for all DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that the purpose of my letter was to ask the Patrons to consider options for reconfiguring their schools to allow the transfer of a school to a new patron.  I requested an interim response to my request within three months and a final response with detailed proposals on divesting schools within six months.  The Deputy will also know that earlier surveys had been conducted in five pilot areas and, as a result, options for change are also being considered by the Patrons in respect of these.</p></reply>

Overall, I am in favour of schools deciding what junior cycle programme they will offer, mindful of the need to reflect the interests of their students.  Curricular choice has been shown to be an important factor in strengthening retention rates to completion of senior cycle in school.</p><p>  Good and enthusiastic science teachers have the opportunity to inspire a real interest in their subject and so ensure that pupils will want to study science.  In 2012, for example, 89.5% of students sat the Junior Certificate science examination.  My Department has developed an online inventory facility to enable schools to provide information about their accommodation, including science laboratories and when all schools have completed the inventory this information will be available.</p></reply>

While it is acknowledged that there were significant difficulties in the operation of the assessment processes last year, I am informed by SUSI that, in preparation for the 2013/2014 academic year, both the on-line application system and the application assessment process are being further developed to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency and respond to experiences from year one.</p><p>  For applicants applying through SUSI for the 2013/14 academic year, a number of new initiatives will make their application more efficient this year. The initiatives include direct information sharing between SUSI and Government bodies and agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the General Register Office and the Central Applications Office. These links should reduce significantly the number of documents required from applicants themselves.</p></reply>

It sought to retain 13.33 posts of the 48 they were due to lose in order to minimise the impact of the reduction on learners and on the provision of courses.  A review of all impact statements received was conducted having regard to the need to operate within overall budgetary constraints and the Employment Control Framework.  As a result of this review some alleviation of the reduction in teaching posts is being allowed as a transitional measure and CDVEC has been allowed retain 10 whole time equivalent teaching posts, that it was due to lose under the new pupil teacher ratio allocation, for the 2013/2014 academic year.  I have arranged for officials in my Department to forward CDVECs impact statement to the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, the report notes concerns in relation to some aspects of our current system, including in relation to the length of time some parents may have to wait for an assessment in order to determine their child's individual educational or care needs.  The report recommends that proposals for a new resource allocation model should be developed by the NCSE, so that schools may be allocated additional teaching resources to support children in line with their level of educational need, rather than by a diagnosed disability category.  I have requested the NCSE to develop a proposal for a revised Allocation Model for further consideration.

The funding provided by this Department to SUSI in the financial year 2012 which includes set-up and operational costs was some 6.7m. Funding requirements for the 2013 financial year are currently under review in light of the recommendations of the Review.  The Review contains a series of recommendations, many of which are already being implemented by SUSI.  In line with these recommendations and in preparation for the 2013/14 academic year, both the online application system and the application assessment process are being further developed to enhance their effectiveness and to deal with the difficulties experienced in year one.</p><p>  A number of new initiatives will make the application process more efficient this year including: direct information sharing between SUSI and Government agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the General Register Office and the Central Applications Office. These links should significantly reduce the number of documents required from applicants themselves.</p></reply>

The legislative proposals will be published in draft form to facilitate a full public discussion. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.  The draft legislation will make it clear that some methods of controlling admissions that are not fair or transparent will no longer be permitted. Other than these methods, schools will continue to have autonomy on the oversubscription criteria that they operate. Any school that is faithful to the Education Act in relation to providing maximum access will have nothing to fear from the proposals.</p></reply>

I am also aware of the serious problem of youth suicide and of the role that schools can play in the area of prevention and ensuring the education system is more responsive to those with emotional or mental health difficulties.  I can inform the Deputy that last January I launched the Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health. They are informed by consultation with key education partners and by the findings of recent research. The guidelines provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being. They emphasise the need to integrate all elements by using a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health. This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships. Support for schools will be integrated into existing CPD work plans for the SPHE support service and will be coordinated nationally in collaboration with NEPS and HSE to ensure a streamlined approach. Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.</p><p>  In addition in the same period I had published, along with my colleague, Minister Fitzgerald, an Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of these actions this year.  Officials from my Department have already commenced work on the implementation of the actions. In particular, an awareness raising initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people is already underway and my Department is supporting the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in March.</p><p>  Work has also commenced on developing new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the school management bodies, teacher unions and national parents councils. These new procedures are due to issue to schools for the start of the next school year. Preliminary work has commenced on other aspects of the Action Plan on Bullying. Implementation will continue in the coming months.</p><p>  In addition, the Framework for Junior Cycle, published in October 2012, is underpinned by 8 principles one of which is &quot;Wellbeing&quot;, Through Wellbeing &quot;the student experience will contribute directly to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience. Learning takes place in a climate focused on collective wellbeing of school, community and society&quot;. The Framework contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of these statements aims to ensure that the student &quot;takes action to safeguard and promote his/her wellbeing and that of others&quot;. </p><p>  In addition, there are six key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. One of the six key skills of Junior Cycle is &quot;Staying Well&quot;.  As part of the revised Junior Cycle, short courses are being prepared by the NCCA not only in PE but also in SPHE and will be available for schools from September 2014. These courses may be assessed as a part of the School Certificate in the new Junior Cycle.</p></reply>

This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement. The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years.  The capital allocation that is available for the school sector in 2013 is expected to have a similar spend pattern as was the case in 2012 and at this time there are no plans to reinstate the Minor Works Grant.</p></reply>

While the focus of this curriculum will be on English and Irish, the integrated approach should help children to transfer skills acquired in one language to other languages and so establish a sound foundation for the learning of a foreign language in post-primary school.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.</p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

In light of the difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.  The National Council for Special Education had suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235 million per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  My Department's view is that the level of investment required would now be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  Given the costs involved and current fiscal constraints, addressing this issue will be very challenging.  I will consider how we can develop a plan to implement the objectives of the EPSEN Act to deliver improved educational outcomes for students with special needs.  Last year, my Department asked the NCSE to provide policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs.  This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan.</p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published.  Whereas the report recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible, the report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has made a number of recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools is available on the NCSE website, <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  The recommendations in the Report will require indepth and detailed examination.  I have asked my Department to carefully review the recommendations and report back to me on them.  I am conscious that in making any changes to our supports for children with Special Educational Needs, we need to protect the gains we have made.  Therefore, I would like to give an assurance that consultation will be a key aspect in the implementation of any of the report's recommendations.</p></reply>

Twelve schools have made contact with the Department.  The level of engagement to date varies from school to school.  Where the authorities of a school approach the Department about entering the Free Education scheme, it is because they are concerned about the future viability of the school and wish to explore all options in considering the future of the school.  I have made it clear that my Department will engage constructively with any fee-charging school that is considering how best to secure its future.  Any approach to my Department will be considered on an individual school-by-school basis, taking account of the significance of the provision concerned in terms of diversity and overall demand for school places in the locality served by a school.  On the basis of the analysis I published earlier this year on the income from fees available to fee-charging schools, I expect that a minority of the fee-charging schools will wish to engage with my Department in planning for their future.</p></reply>

The programme is normally run over the month of July.  Where school-based provision is not feasible, 10 hours per week home-based provision may be grant-aided to eligible pupils.  Summer Camps are not a feature of the July provision scheme, which is intended primarily to ensure the  continuation of the child's education during the month of July.</p> <p>The rate of VAT charged on educational e-books is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law. Under the EU VAT Directive, electronic publications are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT.  There is no option under EU VAT law to exempt e-books from VAT or to apply a reduced rate to them.</p><p>  This issue is of concern not only in Ireland but in a number of EU member states. The EU Commission published a white paper on the future of VAT with the objective of delivering a future VAT system tailored for the Single Market. The Commission also carried out an extensive consultation process.  A summary report of the outcomes of the public consultation process is now available.  It is worth noting that the report states that there was an almost unanimous call for equal treatment of printed books and e-books.  </p><p>  I have brought my concerns to the attention of the Minister for Finance in whose Department decisions on this matter will be made.  I remain committed to the ICT in Schools Programme which must continue to adapt to take account of new technologies and opportunities to further integrate ICT in teaching and learning and the use of e-books is integral to this process.</p></reply>

Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2011/12. The provision for the 2012/13 school year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, the overall level of funding for special education has been retained.</p><p>  I wish to clarify also that the number of Special Needs Assistants and Resource and Learning Support Teachers has been maintained. Approximately 10,000 posts have been provided for Resource and Learning Support Teachers for the current school year and 10,575 posts have been provided for Special Needs Assistants. These are at the same levels as last year. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resource teaching hours and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013. The NCSE are currently processing these applications and schools will be notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2013/14 in advance of the coming school year, based on the number of valid applications received.  As part of the assessment of applications received for 2013/14, the NCSE will be in a position to consider whether there has been increased demand for supports this year, arising from demographic growth or other factors, and will be in a position to advise of the demand for supports for the coming school year. </p><p>  The position in relation to the allocations which will be made to schools for the coming school year will be considered in light of the number of applications for support received by the NCSE and the need to remain within the staffing limits set by the Government's Employment Control Framework. </p></reply>

One such step is the establishment of Textbook Rental Schemes by schools. I am very much in favour of schools establishing such schemes. Schools that have such rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books. Because of this, I launched "Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools" on 28 January 2013. The Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. </p><p>  These Guidelines, along with a Guide for Parents to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them, are currently being sent out to every school in the country and are also available on my Department's website. They were also made available for the websites of both national parents' councils, Barnardos and the society of St Vincent de Paul.  In addition, I received a commitment from the Irish Educational Publishers Association to limit the publication of new editions of textbooks and to maintain editions of books in print, unchanged for at least six years. The publishers have assured me that they would sell books for rental schemes to schools at substantial discounts. </p><p>  I have also previously put on the record of this House my support for any measures that can be put in place to reduce uniform costs for parents including measures such as the use of generic type uniforms or the use of "sew on" crests.  I have raised this matter informally with the National Parents Council at primary level and I recommended that the National Parents Councils &ndash; Primary and Post Primary mobilise parents associations to raise this issue with school authorities.  It is very important that all schools are sensitive to the financial pressures on parents in making decisions, not just about school uniforms or books, but about any matter that has cost implications for parents.</p></reply>

The Review examined the business systems and processes deployed by SUSI and assessed their adequacy in delivering on the overall business goals and objectives of reforming the administration of student grants.</p><p>  I am informed by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) that, in line with recommendations in the Review and in preparation for the 2013/2014 Academic year, both the online application system and the application assessment process are being further developed to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency and respond to experiences from year 1. The online application system has opened on May 20th a number of weeks earlier than for the 2012/13 academic year.  For new applicants going to or returning to college for the 2013/2014 academic year, new initiatives will make their application to SUSI more efficient this year. The initiatives include direct information sharing with SUSI from Government Bodies and Agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Social Protection, General Register Office (GRO) and the Central Applications Office (CAO). These links will reduce significantly the number of documents required. </p><p>  In addition to these developments core staff are now on site. These trained and experienced staff are cross functional and a number of these staff are now fully proficient in specialist areas such as self-employed/farming, appeals and nationality. Revised document management process and systems are in place and a tracking system is being developed which will allow students to follow the progress of their application online and reduce call centre volumes.  Comparisons with the previous year show that by the 20th January 2013 the number of applications processed were 18% ahead of those at the same date in 2012.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements in small primary schools are considerably more favourable than other medium to larger schools. The budget measure is focused on dealing with this cost premium, on a phased basis, through progressively increasing the pupil thresholds for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools. This budget measure relates to the number of teachers allocated to small primary schools and there are no plans to change it.</p><p>  This Government has protected education as much as it can. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The value for money review of small primary school provision is at an advanced stage of preparation. I expect to publish the review and I look forward to debating its findings at that stage.</p></reply>

There is no option under EU VAT law to exempt e-books from VAT or to apply a reduced rate to them.</p><p>  This issue is of concern not only in Ireland but in a number of EU member states. The EU Commission published a white paper on the future of VAT with the objective of delivering a future VAT system tailored for the Single Market. The Commission also carried out an extensive consultation process.  A summary report of the outcomes of the public consultation process is now available.

There are two methods of tendering (the Restricted procedure and the Open procedure). In both procedures there are minimum standards for participation (including previous experience, turnover, insurances, capacity to obtain a bond etc). The minimum standards for participation are stated in the Contract notice/ eTenders advertisement.</p><p>For less complex projects of a small to medium scale, the open procedure is generally used and all contractors meeting the minimum standards are entitled to submit a tender (thus facilitating the inclusion of small to medium enterprises and those with no experience in educational projects). For larger or more complex projects, where it is considered that pre-qualification of contractors is warranted, the Restricted procedure is normally used. In the Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 10). The criteria for suitability assessment, which are taken from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Capital Management Works Framework, include company turnover, insurances, capacity to obtain a bond, personnel for the project, previous experience, and Health and Safety competence.  Guidance on this process and standard questionnaires used are available on my Department's website.</p><p>In any procurement process my Department adheres to the rules and guidelines set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the EU Commission in relation to public procurement. This includes the Department of Finance Circular 10/10, which aims to remove obstacles to SMEs in tendering for public sector contracts.</p><p>A building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist sub-contractors, domestic sub-contractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant etc. In general all sub-contractors employed on education sector building projects are employed directly by the Main Contractor or indirectly by the Main Contractor through other sub-contractors. It is a matter for all sub-contractors to agree terms and conditions and a schedule of payments with the Main Contractor as their direct employer.</p><p>Details of the schools over the last four years that have had building contracts terminated prior to the school's completion was provided to the Deputy in a PQ answer on May 21st. For the Deputy's convenience I have attached this list and updated it to include details for the last five years as now requested.</p><p>There was a bond in place for each of the eleven projects. The bond is used to cover costs that would otherwise accrue to the Employer (i.e. the Department, School, VEC etc.) on foot of a contractor's failure to complete the works. As such the Employer's financial exposure is generally minimal. Negotiations are ongoing with regard to a number of these projects and in some cases the full cost of re-tendering and completion of the works is not yet known. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to release commercially sensitive cost information which is currently the subject of negotiations. To do so would undermine the Department's position with regard to such negotiations.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>County</div></th><th><div>Roll Number</div></th><th><div>School Name</div></th><th><div>Year in which issue arose</div></th><th><div>Reason for Re-tender </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Kilkenny</div></td><td><div>61580P</div></td><td><div>Loreto Secondary School, Granges Road</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Kildare </div></td><td><div>17674B</div></td><td><div>SN Aine Naofa, Ard Cloc, Straffan </div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td>Termination due to Contractors Default </td></tr><tr><td><div>Dublin City</div></td><td><div>20139T</div></td><td><div>Inchicore NS, Sarsfield Road, Dublin 10</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire  Rathdown</div></td><td><div>70030E</div></td><td><div>Senior College, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Eblana Avenue, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Co Dublin </div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Galway City</div></td><td><div>62970K</div></td><td><div>Col&aacute;iste Iogn&aacute;id SJ Bothar na Mara</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick</div></td><td><div>13026P</div></td><td><div>Kilfinane National School </div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick City</div></td><td><div>64201T</div></td><td><div>Ardscoil Ris, North Circular Rd, Limerick</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Roscommon</div></td><td><div>65100S</div></td><td><div>Scoil Mhuire, Strokestown, Co Roscommon</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Offaly</div></td><td><div>17523D</div></td><td><div>SN Cronain Naofa, Dromakeenan</div></td><td><div>2010</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Kildare </div></td><td><div>17662R</div></td><td><div>Scoil Bhride NS , Kill </div></td><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td></tr><tr><td>              Meath</td><td><div>18016O</div></td><td><div>S N Columbain, Ballivor</div></td><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>Insolvency Event</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I will seek to publish the Bill in draft form to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and the education partners.  I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted.  In bringing forward these proposals, my policy objective is to ensure that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law.  I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

The NCSE have now published thier policy advice on Support Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which is available on the website www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE Report is clear that there are many aspects of the current system which parents and schools are very happy with.  However, the NCSE also considers that there are concerns in relation to some aspects of our current system, under the headings of Enrolment, Assessments, and the Supports for children with Special Educational Needs and their allocation.  The Report makes 28 detailed recommendations which the NCSE feels would help to address these issues.</p><p>  One of the key principles which informs the NCSE advice is the principle of inclusive education.  All of the report recommendations are therefore aimed at enhancing the educational experiences of children with special educational needs in schools, including the experience of children in mainstream schools, and building on the progress which we have already made.  The recommendations in the Report are both interesting and significant.  They deserve in-depth and detailed examination and exploration.  That is why I have asked my Department to carefully review the recommendations and report back to me on them.  </p><p>  I am also very conscious that in making any changes to our supports for children with Special Educational Needs, we also need to protect the gains we have made.  I would therefore like to give an assurance that further consultation with stakeholders, including the Irish National Teachers Organisation, will be a key aspect in the implementation of any of these recommendations. </p></reply>

For applicants going to or returning to college for the 2013/14 academic year, a number of new initiatives will make their application to SUSI more efficient this year.  The initiatives include direct information sharing between SUSI and Government bodies and agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the General Register Office (GRO) and the Central Applications Office (CAO).  These links should reduce significantly the number of documents required from applicants themselves.  In addition to these developments, core staff are now on site.  These trained and experience staff are cross functional and a number of these staff are now fully proficient in specialist areas such as analysis of income from self-employment, nationality issues and appeals.  There is a revised document management process in place and also a new tracking system is currently being developed which will allow students to follow the progress of their application on-line and thereby reduce the requirement for students to contact the SUSI helpdesk for updates on the status of their applications.</p></reply>

The tornado's winds exceeded two hundred miles per hour, flattened entire blocks and demolished two schools and a hospital during the fifty minute period during which it passed through the area.

Indeed, I think it would be fair to say that Ireland, for many years, has been a leader on hunger and nutrition even before the issue gained more recent interest.  Irish Aid is committed to building further on the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report, the framework which continues to guide Ireland&rsquo;s response to addressing global hunger and under-nutrition, and its priority areas of focus, in particular targeting under-nutrition in mothers and children.     </p><p>  With under-nutrition causing the deaths of an estimated 3 million children every year, and 165 million children under five years of age suffering from stunting and lacking the nutrients they need to develop their full potential, Irish Aid has strengthened its nutrition response in recent years.  Since its inception in 2010, Ireland has been a strong supporter of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement, a global movement which brings together different development partners to tackle under-nutrition, especially maternal, infant and child under-nutrition.  </p><p>  We are supporting a wide range of specific nutrition interventions and programmes in Irish Aid partner countries with a particular focus on preventing stunting in early childhood by targeting the 1,000 day window of opportunity (from pregnancy to the age of two).  We work with partners to improve infant and young child feeding practices in Tanzania and Sierra Leone and promote exclusive breastfeeding for infants up to six months of age.  We are supporting a number of micronutrient supplementation programmes which deliver essential vitamins and minerals to poor households with young children through providing capsules, micronutrient powders and food sprinkles.  We are also supporting national programmes in Mozambique, Malawi and Ethiopia to fortify food staples such as flour, sugar and salt with essential vitamins and minerals.  </p><p>  Vitamin A deficiency is the number one cause of childhood blindness and also greatly compromises the immune system.  In Malawi, Mozambique and Ethiopia we are working with partners to address high Vitamin A deficiency rates through the growing of nutritious, and vitamin A enriched, orange fleshed varieties of sweet potato.  In Tanzania we are working with partners to improve nutrition through enhancing homestead production of nutrient rich foods.  We are working with partners in Lesotho on a keyhole gardens programme in which poor households can grow micro-nutrient rich vegetables all year-round. </p><p>  We have delivered on our target of directing twenty per cent of the Irish Aid budget on hunger reduction. Reaching this target has involved a reorientation of our development programme to ensure a stronger hunger and nutrition response at country level and at the global level.  It clearly marks Ireland out in global terms as a nation that is committed in the fight against hunger and under-nutrition.  We estimate that in 2012 Irish Aid expended approximately &euro;14 million on direct nutrition interventions, however this figure may indeed be higher after we get feedback from Irish Aid's civil society partners on the use of grants provided to them. </p></reply>

In 2011 a mandate for a UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran was created by the Human Rights Council.  According to the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report of February 2013 there continue to be widespread and systematic violations of human rights in Iran.  His report presents in detail a situation in which civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are undermined and violated both in law and practice.  Moreover, a lack of Government investigation and redress generally fosters a culture of impunity, further weakening the impact of the international human rights instruments which Iran has ratified.</p><p>  The Special Rapporteur has sought to visit Iran in order to engage in dialogue and further investigate allegations of human rights violations.  However, the Iranian government has not yet granted him access.  Representatives of my Department met with the Special Rapporteur in March of this year and discussed his concerns.  Ireland and the EU strongly supported the extension of his mandate at the Human Rights Council and will continue to push for his being allowed access to Iran.</p><p>  The EU is also very concerned by the deterioration of Iran's human rights situation, even more so since the crackdown which followed the 2009 presidential elections.  In response to the worsening human rights situation, the EU in 2011 agreed sanctions &ndash; including a travel ban and asset freeze &ndash; against certain named people complicit in or responsible for grave human rights violations in Iran.  EU High Representative Ashton has made a number of statements regarding specific human rights cases in Iran, most recently in January and February of this year.  The EU's principal and consistent policy has been to call on Iran to live up to the international human rights standards to which it has freely subscribed.</p></reply>

The conclusions of this conference are closely aligned to the Government&rsquo;s development priorities for Ireland's EU Presidency.  A central focus for Ireland's Presidency, which is strongly mirrored in the outcomes of this conference, has been the need to tackle global hunger and under-nutrition and the need to build the resilience of vulnerable individuals, families, communities and nations to food and other crises.  </p><p>  As EU Presidency, we are striving to forge stronger links between the EU's development and humanitarian policies and programmes, through an increased focus on building community resilience.  We are emphasising the need to comprehensively address the root causes of food and nutrition insecurity and the underlying vulnerabilities affecting poor people.  We are stressing the need for the EU and its Member States to increase support for longer-term programmes which assist partner countries to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and manage food and other crises.  We are asking the EU to recognise the importance of addressing vulnerability in a joined up, multi-sectoral way by linking relief and development through a strong partnership approach and to manage risk rather than simply react to it.  </p><p>  Ultimately, better development and risk reduction can reduce the need for emergency relief and better relief can contribute to sustainable development.  Investing in resilience today through humanitarian and development assistance is also much more cost effective than responding to a crisis tomorrow.  I am bringing these messages to the development segment of the Foreign Affairs Council today.  We have worked closely with EU Member States, the European External Action Service and the EU Commission to develop strong sets of Council Conclusions on food and nutrition security in external assistance and on the EU approach to resilience.  I expect that these Council Conclusions will be considered and adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council today.</p></reply>

The Senate Immigration Reform Bill (S.744) is a very extensive piece of draft US legislation that contains a comprehensive and complex set of reforms across the US immigration system.</p><p>  The Government has already welcomed the inclusion of provisions which would provide a solution for the undocumented Irish and opportunities for future flows of migration between our two countries. However, all of its provisions, including those in relation to the J1 programme, are at the early stage of the legislative process and it is too early to indicate the timing and final shape of any legislation.  The Government greatly values the current provision of the J1 programme and believes it is important that the programme be as accessible as possible and that efforts be made to ensure high levels of uptake.  Our Embassy in Washington remains in very close contact with the US Congress and the Administration to ensure that the interests of all Irish citizens are advanced in any immigration legislation that is passed.</p></reply>

This proposed programme, known as the EU Aid Volunteers Initiative, is aimed at strengthening the EU&rsquo;s capacity to respond to humanitarian crises and at building the capacity and resilience of vulnerable communities. It also aims to provide training and experience to those interested in working in the humanitarian sector and to raise the levels of awareness and the visibility of the humanitarian assistance provided by the EU across the world. Ireland supports the establishment of a well-functioning, well-trained corps of humanitarian aid volunteers, through an initiative which responds to the needs of the humanitarian aid sector and of the people they seek to help on the ground. Throughout the course of our Presidency, we have been working closely with the Council and Commission to facilitate agreement on the Council position with a view to commencing discussions with the European Parliament, as co-legislator, on the text of the draft Regulation required to establish the legal basis for the initiative.</p><p>  The EU Aid Volunteers Initiative is intended, inter alia, to offer opportunities to young Europeans with an interest in humanitarian assistance, but without sufficient experience to gain employment. Irish citizens will be afforded the same opportunity to apply to participate in this initiative as citizens of all other EU Member States.</p><p>  At home here in Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s Policy for International Development &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, which was launched earlier this month, sets out our commitment to modernise the way in which we support volunteering. One of the key ways in which this will be done will be through a new national Volunteering Initiative which will strengthen support for volunteering and promote participation in high quality volunteer programmes that contribute to development. The Volunteering Initiative will reflect needs in developing countries and increase volunteering opportunities for those who have those skills and experience that are in short supply in the developing world.  Our commitment to work to enhance humanitarian volunteering opportunities at EU level for Irish citizens will also be an important component of the Volunteering Initiative</p></reply>

This event was co-sponsored by the Institute of International and European Affairs.  The purpose of the Conference was to mark the tenth anniversary of the Thessaloniki Summit, which gave a formal political commitment on the part of all EU member states to the perspective of the Western Balkans states&rsquo; accession to the European Union, and adopted a concrete set of steps that would lead to this aim &ndash; the Thessaloniki Agenda.</p><p>  The 10th anniversary of the Thessaloniki Summit marked an appropriate juncture at which to assess the results of Thessaloniki Agenda and to reflect on the progress made by the countries in the region towards EU integration, the difficulties encountered along the way, and the outlook for completion of the process.

Topics addressed included the evolution of the accession process, the sustainable economic development of the Western Balkans, and the future of enlargement in the Western Balkans.</p><p>  In the margins of this conference I held bilateral meetings with Ms. Vesna Pusić, First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Croatia, and with Dr. Miroslav Lajč&aacute;k, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs for Slovakia.</p></reply>

The dimensions of the crisis are truly daunting.  An estimated 80,000 people have lost their lives; one-third of Syrians have either fled the country, are internally displaced or are otherwise in need of assistance; and there is an ever increasing threat to regional stability as mirrored by escalating tensions and violence in northern Lebanon and the recent horrific bombing in Reyhanli, southern Turkey in which fifty one people died.  Since his appointment in August 2012 and in extremely challenging circumstances, the UN/League of Arab States Special Envoy Ladkhar Brahimi has shown great resolve in working to achieve these objectives.  Ireland and its EU partners have expressed full support for his efforts, notably his search for a formula for transition based on last year&rsquo;s Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and providing for a transitional Government leading to free elections in Syria.</p><p>  Special Envoy Brahimi has also long insisted on the crucial role of the international community in seeking a political settlement to the crisis, in particular through the UN Security Council. It is a source of great regret that the UN Security Council up to now has been unable to demonstrate leadership to the international community and adopt a strong Resolution on the crisis. Despite a number of unsuccessful efforts to agree a Resolution, it remains clear that only a united Council acting in concert can provide the necessary strong political backing to underpin any current peace efforts.</p><p>  For this reason, I warmly welcome the agreement reached by the US and Russia, following bilateral discussions in Moscow earlier this month involving Secretary of State Kerry, President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov, to work together on an International Conference on Syria which would be held in Geneva in the next few weeks.  Both UN Secretary General Ban and Special Envoy Brahimi have welcomed this development. The EU has also pledged its full political support for the US/Russian initiative. Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 27 May which I attended made clear that the EU would spare no effort in helping to create the appropriate conditions for a successful convening of this conference.</p><p>  There is an onus on all sides involved with this crisis to do all possible to support the planned Geneva II conference and endure a successful outcome. I understand the Syrian Government has now agreed in principle to attend the talks and it is to be hoped that the Syrian democratic opposition, led by the Syrian National Coalition, will seize the opportunity offered by the US-Russia proposal and engage fully in a process of dialogue aimed at ending the violence and starting the much needed transition towards democratic rule in Syria.</p><p>  Ireland and the EU will remain fully occupied at all levels of our international engagement in securing the earliest cessation of violence in Syria and in providing the Syrian population with the aid and care they need and the hope that their nightmare will soon end.</p></reply>

There are over 4 million Syrians who have been internally displaced, while a further 1.5 million people have been forced to abandon their country altogether. Countries hosting refugees, such as Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, are under great pressure as the influx continues. There are also grave concerns that the spread of disease could have catastrophic consequences as temperatures rise in the coming months.  Ireland has already provided over &euro;8.15 million in assistance to Syria and the wider region, making us one of the most generous donors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. This support from the Irish people has been provided through credible partners such as WFP, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p><p>  As one of the founding members of the Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) initiative, Ireland is committed to acting as a responsible and accountable donor. We are also committed to the implementation of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, which articulates the EU and its Member States&rsquo; commitment to ensuring that humanitarian aid pledges are met in a timely manner and are clearly linked to the needs of those most affected.  </p><p>  As part of our overall total support to the Syria crisis response, I pledged &euro;4.7 million at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013. Since I made that commitment, Ireland has already surpassed it, with funding of &euro;5.7 million having been provided to date this year.  The UN plans for the humanitarian situation in Syria and its neighbouring countries requested a total of &euro;1.5 billion. The pledges at the International Pledging Conference reached this amount but regrettably the international community has only provided funding valued at just over 70% of the pledged commitments to date. We are doing all we can to ensure that other States follow our example in meeting their promises in full and without delay. </p><p>  During my visit to al-Zaatari refugee camp in northern Jordan in 2012 and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s visit to Nizip refugee camp in southern Turkey in April this year, we both drew attention to the plight of Syrians and the urgency for global action to address their needs. As Presidency of the Council of European Union during the first half of 2013, we have also underlined the gravity of the humanitarian situation, including at the informal meeting of the Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid (COHAFA) held in Dublin last month. We have also highlighted the dire humanitarian situation and the need for further donor support at the &lsquo;Friends of Syria&rsquo; conferences in Paris, Tunis, Istanbul and Marrakesh and the &lsquo;Syria Humanitarian Forum&rsquo; discussions in Geneva. When I meet Valerie Amos (Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator) in New York next week, I will raise this very serious humanitarian situation and discuss with her how we can all work together to achieve an effective humanitarian response.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, humanitarian needs are continuing to escalate, both within Syria and in neighbouring countries. Ireland will therefore continue to use every opportunity to put a spotlight on this deteriorating situation and emphasise the imperative for all of us to fulfil promises made to assist those worse affected by this conflict.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they view tobacco smuggling as a very serious matter, and that combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them. Their &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco trade (2011-2013) includes a wide range of measures that are designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the development of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.</p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.</p><p>  Considerable success is being achieved against both the importation of illicit tobacco products and their sale within the country. Over 95 million cigarettes and more than 5 tonnes of tobacco were seized during 2012.  In addition, there were 57 convictions for cigarette smuggling, resulting in the imposition of 26 custodial sentences, some suspended, and fines amounting to &euro;93,550.  Action against the illegal selling of cigarettes led to 75 convictions during the year, with 21 custodial sentences, some suspended, and total fines of &euro;153,050.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners assure me that they are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and that they will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.  The penalties for smuggling tobacco products are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, and penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products are contained in section 78 of the Finance Act 2005.</p><p>  Fines for tobacco offences under these acts were increased substantially in the Finance Act, 2010. On conviction following summary prosecution, under section 119 of the 2001 Act, a court may impose a fine of  &euro;5,000 and the court may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, instead of, or in addition to, the fine. For convictions following prosecution on indictment, the fine is an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970 or, where the value of the tobacco products involved in the offence is greater than &euro;250,000, not exceeding three times the value of the products. The Court may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, as an alternative to, or in addition to the fine.</p><p>  In the case of a conviction under section 78 of the 2005 Act following a summary prosecution, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both. The penalty following conviction on indictment is a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both a fine and a prison term.  The specific penalty to be imposed in any particular case is a matter for the courts. Section 130(2) of the 2001 Act permits a trial judge, in his or her discretion, to mitigate a fine incurred for an offence under excise law, provided that the amount mitigated is not greater than 50 per cent of the amount of the fine.  There are no proposals for further penalty increases at present, but the position will be kept under review, taking account, among other considerations, of practical experience of the operation of the increased fines provided for in the 2010 Act.</p></reply>

The grouping of properties into bands for property taxation purposes was also recommended by the 1982 and 2009 Commissions on Taxation.  Grouping properties into valuation bands, with the rate applying at the mid-point of the bands - in effect creating fixed sum and certain charges for each band - can ease the valuation challenges.  In devising the bands, a balance should be struck between the width of the bands and avoiding substantial liability differences between adjacent bands.  The bands used for the LPT are much narrower than those suggested by the 2009 Commission on Taxation.</p><p>  It is unavoidable that some individuals will benefit or lose no matter what bands are chosen, and narrower bands would make it more difficult for taxpayers to decide the correct band for their property.  As the Deputy states, if the current first band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 was replaced by two &euro;50,000 bands, this would lead to lower LPT payments for owners of properties valued below &euro;50,000, which would pay tax at &euro;45 in a full year (0.18% of &euro;25,000, the mid point between &euro;0 and &euro;50,000).  However, it would lead to higher LPT payments for properties valued between &euro;50,001 and &euro;100,000, which would pay tax of &euro;135 in full year (0.18% of &euro;75,000), rather than the current charge for all properties valued between &euro;0 and &euro;100,000 of &euro;90 in a full year (0.18% of &euro;50,000).  The charge of &euro;90 in a full year is below the Household Charge of &euro;100 which was payable in 2012 in respect of all properties, including those valued below &euro;50,000.</p><p>  I am satisfied the current system of valuation bands strikes a good balance between ease of assessment and a smooth progression of liabilities between the valuation bands.</p></reply>

The World Bank Migration and Remittances Factbook for 2011 shows total remittance flows into Ireland of  USD 755m and remittance outflows of USD 2, 843 m. The newspaper reports focussed in particular on the figure for remittances from Nigerians living in Ireland to Nigeria &ndash; USD 601m. This figure seemed disproportionately high in view of the reported size of the Nigerian population in Ireland and in view of the level of remittances from other nationalities to their home countries.  I understand from the World Bank that the remittance figures relating to Nigeria are estimates provided to the World Bank by the Nigerian authorities and not actual data.  These estimates are based on total remittance inflows reported by Nigeria allocated according to its estimated stock of emigrants and further adjusted by the World Bank in the light of differing national per capita income levels.  The World Bank believes that some elements of the estimation process may not be reliable.</p><p>  Neither the Central Statistics Office nor the Central Bank of Ireland publish statistics relating to remittance flows to individual countries. However, available information would indicate that the figures published in the World Bank Migration and Remittances Factbook in respect of remittance flows between Ireland and Nigeria are open to serious scrutiny and that the real figure may be a fraction of the published figure.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Central Bank that discussions are underway to determine the most appropriate provider and that no decision on this has yet been made.

As the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, numerous other Ministers, and I have explained already, there is no special tax rate deal done with any company. The Irish tax system is statute-based and therefore there is no possibility of special tax rate deals being done with companies. All companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their trading profits arising in Ireland.  All companies here pay a corporation tax rate of 25% on their non trading income, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%. These rates are set down in statute law and are not open to negotiation with taxpayers.</p><p>  I am advised that Revenue, as a matter of course, engages with taxpayers, including multi-national companies, in order to provide clarity as to the application of Irish tax law. The objective is to ensure that the correct Irish tax is paid by these companies at the correct time and in accordance with Irish law.</p><p>  In relation specifically to the question of any approaches or representations to me by any parties to request the &ldquo;special tax treatment&rdquo;, I would emphasise again that there is no possibility of &ldquo;special tax treatment&rdquo; for any taxpayer outside of what is provided for in legislation.  Having said that, of course the Deputies are aware that during the budgetary process each year the Department engages with all stakeholders as part of the consultation process and the Department receives a wide variety of submissions from interested parties.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of tax incentives that were generally available to all companies in the 1980s, I would refer the Deputy to the scheme of relief from corporation tax provided for in Part IV of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 (Export Sales Relief) which expired on 5 April 1990. That relief provided for a reduction to nil of the corporation tax on profits from the export of goods manufactured in the State.</p><p>  Export Sales Relief was withdrawn on a phased basis from 1980 to 1991 and was effectively replaced with a relief provided for in Chapter VI of the 1980 Finance Act (Manufacturing Relief), which provided for a reduction of the corporation tax to a rate of 10% on profits from the sale of goods manufactured in the State.  Manufacturing Relief expired on 31st December 2010.  The manufacturing scheme of relief was extended to activities carried out in the IFSC and ancillary services located in the Customs House Docks Area and to activities carried on in the Shannon Airport Area. Relief for these activities expired on 31 December 2005.</p><p>  I would reiterate that all companies resident in Ireland are now chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p></reply>

The Financial Inclusion Working Group (FIWG) was tasked with governance of the project.  The Standard Bank Account (SBA) Pilot finished on 31 March 2013 after a 9-month pilot period.  A total of 205 accounts were opened during the Pilot, which was below expectations.  The initial Pilot evaluation suggests that the lower than expected take-up of the SBA was due to the lack of a &lsquo;trigger event&rsquo; amongst the target cohort in the pilot locations, such as a requirement to have an income or benefit payment made to a bank account.</p><p>  I am advised that the report of the FIWG on the Pilot will be submitted for my consideration in a few weeks, following which I expect that the Report will be presented to Government and published.  My Department through the Financial Inclusion Working Group will work closely with all stakeholders over the coming months to optimise the availability of the Standard Bank Account nationally.  The ultimate aim of the strategy is to ensure that those who were once financially excluded can access all of the benefits of the modern financial system including affordable credit and relevant protection products.</p></reply>

If the Irish tax legislation were amended to provide that a 1% withholding tax would apply to outgoing royalties from Irish companies, or that withholding tax would apply to dividends paid to treaty countries, any changes would be subject to the relevant tax treaty rules on such payments.  For example, if a double taxation treaty provided that the rate of withholding tax on royalties was 0% - and this is the case in some 30 (out of 69) of Ireland&rsquo;s signed treaties - then that zero rate would apply, because treaties have precedence over domestic law.</p><p>  Similarly, some 22 of Ireland&rsquo;s double taxation treaties provide for nil withholding taxes on dividends, and approximately 30 more provide for a rate of 5% for companies (subject to an ownership criterion being met) - these are the maximum rates that would apply, regardless of the rate inserted in domestic law. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the available data on royalties is not sufficiently detailed or precise to ascertain the revenue that could arise to the Exchequer if the changes mentioned in the question were made  In relation to the revenue that could be raised for the Exchequer if withholding tax were applied to dividends paid to treaty countries, it is not possible to separately identify from tax records the amount of dividends that are paid to treaty countries and therefore the information requested by the Deputy cannot be ascertained.</p></reply>

While the relief is commonly referred to as retirement relief it is not, in general, necessary that the farmer disposing of his or her farm actually retire from farming.  An exception to this is where the relief is claimed by reference to the Early Retirement from Farming Scheme <b>(&#8220;the Scheme&#8221;), </b>as a condition of that Scheme is that the farmer permanently retires from farming on a commercial basis.  Once a farmer satisfies the conditions of the Scheme (including in particular the permanent retirement from farming) and satisfies the related conditions of Section 598, relief from capital gains tax may be claimed when the land is ultimately disposed of, even though at that time the farmer does not farm the lands (e.g. the lands were let up to the time of disposal in accordance with the terms of the Scheme).</p><p>  However, if a farmer breaches the conditions of the Scheme at any stage, for example, by not permanently ceasing farming, the Scheme contains provisions with regard to recovery of all benefits obtained under the Scheme.  From a capital gains tax viewpoint, if a farmer were to claim Section 598 relief on the basis that he or she satisfied the terms of the Scheme but those terms are not adhered to, then the claim for Section 598 relief would fail - as neither the terms of the Scheme nor the basis on which the relief under Section 598 is claimable would be satisfied.</p></reply>

The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State.  This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based.  The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets.  The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged.  In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will establish the regulatory framework for the licensing regime, was published in July last year.  Since that date work has been continuing by officials of my Department and Revenue on the drawing up of a number of amendments to the Bill to strengthen enforcement measures.  It is my intention, given the number of amendments, to go back to Government in the very near future for approval to republish the Bill.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the EU Technical Standards and Regulations Directive it will be necessary to show the published Bill to the EU Commission and other Member States, which could take 3 months for clearance.

The range of electronic and on-line contact options are recognised as leaders amongst international revenue organisations, and these are supported by &ldquo;lo-call&rdquo; telephone services, postal services and public offices throughout the country.  Revenue regards it as a strategic priority to make it easier and less costly for taxpayers to comply with their obligations.  Along with other public service organisations, Revenue is obliged to regularly review the manner in which service is delivered to ensure the best mix of effectiveness and economy.  As part of that process, procedures in the Limerick, Cork and Tralee offices have changed since the beginning of 2013.  Up to that point, taxpayers could have certain tax matters fully dealt with, and have their forms processed instantly at the public counter.  While this was an excellent service, it had a number of problems, including the difficulty of ensuring proper management of workflow.  Processing at the counter ceased from January 2013.  Taxpayers now receive a full service in terms of information and guidance, including detailed guidance on use of our on-line services.  The public areas also have facilities for completion of forms and for self-service on computers provided for the purpose, with assistance if needed.  Any forms or other documents are received for later processing and responses sent out by post or on-line as appropriate.</p><p>  The number of callers per day has not fallen as a result of the changes implemented.  Indeed, there is evidence that some taxpayers are more ready to drop into the public office because their waiting time is considerably less than in the past.</p><p>  The local Revenue offices also provide an important service in supporting people with the filing and payment of Local Property Tax, including advice and support in filing on-line.  Revenue has concentrated its support for Local Property Tax on a telephone help line and online resources and advice, so the public office support is general in nature.  Taxpayers with complex queries are directed to the telephone and on-line resources.  Due to the huge volume of calls being received, there may be some delay in contacting the telephone help line, but Revenue's statistics indicate a very good response rate and do not show an unreasonable delay.</p><p>  Revenue staff &ndash; in Limerick and elsewhere &ndash; continue to provide a comprehensive service to the public, albeit in a slightly changed form.  Seasonal peaks are a normal feature of Revenue business and can lead to temporary backlogs and delays.  I am advised there has been no deterioration in the quality of service offered by Revenue offices.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have any data on &ldquo;vacant land&rdquo;.  Based on figures provided by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) the number of "vacant dwellings" per the 2011 census was in the region of 290,000.  However, the CSO does not have overall valuation data for such dwellings so it would not be possible to estimate the potential yield from a vacant land tax on such properties.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Local Property Tax applies in the same way to vacant residential properties as it applies to occupied residential properties, unless such properties are not suitable for use as a dwelling.</p><p>  I am advised by the Central Statistics Office and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that they do not have data on undeveloped land which would enable a yield from a &ldquo;vacant land tax&rdquo; to be estimated. </p><p>  With regards to vacant commercial properties, I am advised by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that the Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property in a county council or urban area is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for payment of rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a 100% refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes.  These are where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.</p><p>  Separate legislation governs refunds in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Section 71 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930; section 29 of the Limerick City Management Act 1934 and section 20 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act 1941.  While the same criteria for refunds apply, only 50% of the rates paid is refundable to the owner of vacant premises in these cities.</p></reply>

Although such cover is not currently a compulsory requirement, it is deemed an essential requirement by many bodies that authorise others to conduct work on their behalf, e.g. many primary contractors will refuse to allow sub contractors onto a site without proof that they hold adequate public liability cover, even though it is not a legal requirement.  In addition, it is advisable for anybody getting work carried out in their home to ensure that a contractor is properly insured before commencing work.  This avoids any potential dispute over liability should an accident happen or if any problems arise with the work carried out.</p><p>  There are currently no proposals to make public liability insurance compulsory.  It should be noted that any decision of this nature would have implications for the small business sector and therefore would first require consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

It is designed to provide appropriate and effective consumer protection measures and to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner.  The Central Bank first published the CCMA in February 2009.  It set out rules for lenders when dealing with borrowers in arrears with their mortgage payments.  The current CCMA, which came into effect on 1 January 2011, took account of the recommendations of the Government Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and further strengthened protections for borrowers in mortgage repayment difficulty by setting out the mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP). </p><p>  The MARP is a five-step process which requires lenders to: 1) communicate with borrowers; 2) obtain financial information using a standard financial statement (SFS); 3) complete an assessment of the borrowers case; 4) consider options to resolve the arrears; 5) consider appeals.  As per the CCMA, lenders must draw up and implement procedures for dealing with borrowers covered by the CCMA.  These procedures must, inter alia, set out how the lender will implement the 5 steps of the MARP.  The CCMA along with clarifications that the Central Bank has issued can be found at: <i><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></i>.  </p></reply>

I was not prescriptive in how this was to be achieved respecting their differing State ownership and investment and paths to profitability.</p><p>  It is not possible at this stage to reveal precise individual details bar what has been put into the public domain.  I can confirm that all three institutions have put forward pension changes to varying degrees as part of their respective overall responses. </p><p>  As I have said previously I am constrained as to what I can say presently due to commercial sensitivities and perhaps, more critical at this stage, industrial relations concerns as the normal protocols continue and need to be respected and observed by all parties.  This is something I have advocated throughout this process.  I am anxious, therefore, that all the participants in these discussions are given space and time to conduct these critical negotiations.</p><p>  The Government readily acknowledges the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognises that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.  Therefore, I would encourage all sides to engage in these discussions proactively through the appropriate forums in view of the serious and critical consequences for all concerned.  </p><p>  At this stage, it would not be appropriate or realistic to specify a timeframe for the savings to be delivered.  However, in view of the fact that the three institutions continue to be loss making the timely delivery of such savings which will have an ongoing impact on the cost base is critical to their viability, the availability of credit to the economy  and to the future employment prospects of their employees.</p></reply>

Since 1999, section 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 added rules which provide that certain companies incorporated in the State are to be regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes.  These provisions were introduced into the Taxes Consolidation Act, by section 82 of the Finance Act 1999 which was enacted on 25 March 1999.  They were part of a package of measures considered necessary to deal with the issue of Irish registered companies which, while registered in Ireland, had no contact or association with the State following their registration.  There was concern that some of these companies were engaged in fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  As these companies were managed and controlled outside the State, they were not resident in Ireland for tax purposes under the long-standing management and control rule.</p><p>  Consistent with the purpose of the provisions - to address companies that were not managed and controlled in the State and had no real connection with the State apart from having been incorporated here - the 1999 additions to the residence rules provided that only Irish-incorporated companies with no other connection with the State were to be regarded as resident in the State by virtue of their incorporation here.  A company incorporated in the State is not regarded as tax-resident here where:</p><p>- either the company or a related company is carrying on a trade in the State and either</p><p>- the company is ultimately controlled in a tax treaty country or in an EU Member State or</p><p>- the company or a related company is quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the EU or in a tax treaty country, or </p><p>- the company is treated under a tax treaty as not resident in the State. </p><p>  While tax law is reviewed from time to time from a policy perspective, I have not commissioned the Revenue Commissioners to conduct a report on companies that are incorporated as Irish but non-resident for tax purposes.  I am informed by the Commissioners that they have considered such companies in the course of monitoring the arrangements of large cases.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of companies and the names of same that are incorporated here but non-resident for tax purposes - and numbers of any related jobs - are not available as they are not separately compiled.  My Department is currently working with the Revenue Commissioners to examine further the issues that have recently arisen in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

However, I am aware of the Memorandum issued by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations last week.  I want to make it clear that we do not have a special low corporation tax rate for individual companies.  Ireland&rsquo;s tax system is statute-based so there is no possibility of individual special tax rates for companies. </p><p>  All companies resident in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits.  Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.  The tax rates being quoted publicly this week are emphatically not the rate of tax paid by such companies - or by any company on its Irish activities.   Having examined the document produced by the US Senate Subcommittee, it appears that the rate that is being quoted is got as follows: the tax charged in Ireland on the branch activities in Ireland of companies that are not resident here is divided by the entire profit of the companies concerned as if they were resident here, which they are not.  </p><p>  It is clearly wrong and misleading to attribute this rate of tax to Ireland.  Companies which are not tax-resident in Ireland are no more chargeable in Ireland in respect of their entire profits than they are in any other country in which the company is not tax resident - and these company profit figures should not be used to assert special tax rates that simply do not apply here. </p></reply>

Information in relation to the tax payments of multinational corporations is not separately identifiable.  In relation to the effective tax rate for multinational corporations, I have repeatedly stated that there is no agreed international methodology for calculating the &lsquo;effective rate&rsquo; of corporation tax.  As there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure in place, I am not in a position to provide such a measure for the period referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>You may wish to note that information from the corporation tax returns filed by all companies for tax years from 1990/91 up to 2010, the latest year currently available, is published in the Statistical Reports of the Revenue Commissioners.

I would refer the Deputy to the scheme of relief from corporation tax provided for in Part IV of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 (Export Sales Relief) which expired on 5 April 1990. That relief provided for a reduction to nil of the corporation tax on profits from the export of goods manufactured in the State.</p><p>Export Sales Relief was withdrawn on a phased basis from 1980 to 1991 and was effectively replaced with a relief provided for in Chapter VI of the 1980 Finance Act (Manufacturing Relief), which provided for a reduction of the corporation tax to a rate of 10% on profits from the sale of goods manufactured in the State.  Manufacturing Relief expired on 31st December 2010.  The manufacturing scheme of relief was extended to activities carried out in the IFSC and ancillary services located in the Customs House Docks Area and to activities carried on in the Shannon Airport Area. Relief for these activities expired on 31 December 2005.</p></reply>

I am advised by NAMA that, as in the Republic of Ireland, a particular difficulty associated with the Northern Ireland residential market has been the lack of independent professional research and data about the key factors that will influence the future availability and cost of housing.  For this reason, NAMA considered a number of research proposals by reference to the need for practical market insights to facilitate informed decision-making by all market participants, including NAMA, in the Northern Ireland residential market.  Based on the proposals received, NAMA agreed to help fund research by the University of Ulster into the geography of future residential supply and demand in Northern Ireland with a particular focus on residential land bank assets.  In December 2012, the University published its Spatial Analysis of Residential Development Land Banks, which overlays residential land bank assets in Northern Ireland with planning, infrastructure, demographic and housing need data to produce a comprehensive picture of likely future housing supply and demand patterns.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware also that NAMA has recently agreed to take a leading role in promoting and funding a two-year research programme on housing in the Republic of Ireland to be undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRI).  The Agency advises that proposals for research such as this are considered by, amongst other criteria, reference to the practical application of expected outcomes.  I am advised by NAMA that the agency does not operate a fund for such undertakings but procures research as and when required, in line with its commercial remit.</p></reply>

In addition, in 2011 the Revenue Commissioners submitted a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure that identified their resourcing requirements.<font color="#FF0000"> </font> As the Deputy will be aware the Minister For Public Expenditure is responsible for the Employment Control Framework for staffing and for the control of Government Expenditure through the Estimates process and in this context, most day to day requests for sanction for staffing or recruitment are managed between that Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  While conscious of the need to control expenditure, I have been generally supportive of the cases made by Revenue and recognise the need to ensure that Revenue is adequately resourced to ensure the effective operation of the Revenue administration for the benefit of the Exchequer.</p><p>  As part of the engagement between my Department and Revenue relating to the introduction of the Local Property Tax, I supported Revenue's resource requirements, and these are set out in the Expenditure Report for 2013 and in the Revised Estimates for Public Services, 2013, for the Finance Group of Votes, which I discussed with the relevant Committee last week.  </p><p>  Regarding legislation, since 2009 there have been no less than eight Finance Acts, including two Finance (Local Property Tax) Acts.  Given the nature of the engagement between Revenue and my Department in preparing these Bills, it would be impossible to disaggregate with any precision all the legislative changes arose as a result of requests from the Revenue Commissioners.  However, many legislative changes have been implemented to improve the administration of the tax system and to improve compliance.  Examples include, the reform to the Relevant Contract Tax System, the introduction of a new excise licencing system for mineral oils and the modernisation of direct taxes assessing rules for self-assessment.  For completeness, I should also add that the Revenue Commissioners will, from time to time, comment through my Department on legislative proposals presented by other Ministers.  If the Deputy has something specific in mind, it may be possible to be more helpful.  </p><p>  I will continue to carefully consider any new legislative proposals received from the Revenue Commissioners that make it easier and less costly for taxpayers to comply and that help reduce non-compliance.</p></reply>

Construction is expected to commence in 2014.  I am informed that the Bank will tender for services relating to the design, construction and fit out/services of the new building. <font color="#104160"> </font>Once contracts have been finalised, an award notice will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  All tenders will follow relevant European and National public procurement legislation and Government guidelines.</p></reply>

The scheme which will be introduced by Ministerial order, will apply in the first instance on a pilot basis only to specified regeneration areas in Waterford and Limerick.   </p><p>  I indicated in my budget speech in December last year that I would examine proposals for a targeted incentive for already identified regeneration areas. The tax relief that will apply under this scheme will operate for five years from the date of commencement.  However, it is my intention that before it begins, the scheme will be subject to an <i>ex ante </i>cost benefit analysis and, subject to a positive outcome from the analysis, I will seek EU approval under State Aid rules for this initiative to be commenced for Limerick and Waterford cities.  Now that Finance Act 2013 is law, my Department has been working on a request for tender document and I expect the tendering process for the cost benefit analysis project to begin shortly. </p></reply>

It provides for relief to be given for any tax year by way of a deduction equal to 40% of the sportsperson&rsquo;s gross earnings, before expenses, from direct participation in their sport.  The relief is given in the tax year in which the sportsperson permanently retires provided he or she is tax resident in the State for that year.  The relief can be claimed for up to any 10 years in which the sportsperson was resident in the State between the tax year 1990/91 and the tax year in which he or she retires.  They do not have to be consecutive years.  A claim results in a sportsperson&rsquo;s tax liability for the years in question being recalculated, based on the 40% deduction and relief is given by way of a refund of tax paid.</p><p>  The relief was introduced for sportspersons when they permanently retire to acknowledge what they sacrificed in terms of career development and family commitments in order to train and compete at national and international level. It recognised that the majority of professional sportspersons in the State were not wealthy, and tended to have a very short earnings career that could often be cut shorter by injury.  It provides recognition of the particular challenges and difficulties they have in earning their income, the contribution that they make to the image of Ireland at home and abroad, and the enjoyment and interest for the general public that they generate by their participation and success.</p><p>  The relief is given when a sportsperson ceases to be permanently engaged in their sport and is withdrawn where a person recommences the sport on a professional level (although it can be maintained if the sportsperson continues to participate at amateur level).  Withdrawal is by means of an assessment for the total amount of the relief under Case IV of Schedule D in the year of assessment in which the relief was given.  There is no minimum amount that a sportsperson can earn per annum post retirement before facing a claw back of the relief and the reason for the first retirement is not a consideration in granting the relief in the first instance, nor in clawing it back if the individual returns to the sport.  The relief is given on the basis that the individual has permanently retired.</p><p>  Where an assessment is raised, any person who has difficulty in paying the amount due can contact the Office of the Collector-General in relation to payment options.  When the sportsperson subsequently permanently retires he or she can again avail of the relief in that year and in respect of any ten of the years from 1990/91 in which he or she had earnings arising from participation in the sport.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where a residential property is purchased under the equity share programme operated by the National Association of Building Cooperatives (NABCo) the liable person will be the purchaser.  This is on the basis that under this scheme, the purchaser acquires a leasehold interest in the property for a period that exceeds 20 years.  Such a purchaser is in the same position as a property owner who purchases a residential property with a mortgage from a financial institution.

Two such Orders were made in November 2004 and July 2005.</p><p>  At the time these Orders were made the Department of Health and Children had advised that it was unable to locate any documentation which would indicate that a public body had an inspection or regulatory function in respect of the Bethany Home.  Subsequently, in 2007 the Department of Health and Children advised that evidence of a regulatory or inspection function had been located and that the inclusion of Bethany Home in the Redress Scheme could be considered.  However, as the information identified that Bethany Home operated as a mother and baby home it was not regarded as eligible to be considered for inclusion in the Scheme.</p><p>  Following the publication of the Ryan Report, there were a range of requests and demands for the scheme to be extended, including a request for the Bethany Home to be included on the basis that it operated as a children's home.  However, the Government of the time decided against the inclusion of any further institutions within the scheme.  The decision not to extend the scheme has meant the exclusion of a range of institutions which could have been considered for inclusion.  I met with the representatives of the Bethany Home Survivors Group in May 2011.  While acknowledging the hurt and pain that remains with the survivors, having reviewed the papers on the Home and having taken all the circumstances into account, I found no basis to revisit the decision of the previous Government not to include the Home in the Redress Scheme.</p></reply>

My Department produced guidelines for schools in this area last year.  Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which I launched jointly with Minister Kathleen Lynch  in January 2013, was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health  and the Health Service Executive. The  guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other  external agencies and support services.  In addition, in the new Framework for Junior Cycle which I launched in October, "Wellbeing" is one of the 8 principles which underpin the Framework. Through a student's experience in Junior Cycle, I want the student to be able to take actions to safeguard and promote his/ her well - being and that of others.</p><p>  The Bring Me Back Alive Play is one of a range of external resources and initiatives that are available to assist schools in implementing various aspects of the curriculum. Unfortunately my Department is not in a position to endorse individual initiatives, and it is a matter for individual schools to determine which of these resources they  choose to access. My Department's advice is that schools in the first instance should implement the Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools document effectively and when considering collaborating with external agencies in doing work in the area of mental health promotion, schools should  be cognisant of Appendix 3a (DES, Circular 0023/2010) and 3b which provide advice on best practice for Social Personal and Health Education.  The  following is a link to the  Guidelines document: http://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Education-Reports/Well_Being_PP_Schools_Guidelines.pdf.</p></reply>

This Programme is available to all special and mainstream primary schools which have special classes catering for eligible pupils.  Where school based provision is not available, 10 hours per week home based provision may be grant-aided to eligible pupils. In cases where there are qualifying siblings, a combined allocation is made. This is consistent with the school grouping principle, where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils. Accordingly, it is considered appropriate that a tutor can provide collective tuition in the home to siblings. Under these arrangements, each child is receiving a full 10 hours tuition.  In previous years the application process may have failed to identify siblings resulting in double allocations in some cases. This year's application process has corrected this historic deficit. There has not been a change to the scheme's criteria.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.</p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. </p></reply>

These guidelines changed in 2011 and any school which applied for funding before that date was grant-aided on a different basis.  The current level of funding of &euro;6,500 for one special class plus &euro;7,000 to purchase equipment for the school's Multi Sensory Room is provided to all primary and post-primary schools irrespective of the delivery method used. In addition, grant aid is available to all schools to fund the purchase of special items of furniture for special needs pupils. The scheme applies to all children who are diagnosed as having special needs. Schools must apply directly to the Department and their applications must be supported by a report from a professional who assessed the pupil.

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children. It is a matter for schools to then allocate and manage these resources to assist children as their needs arise. All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013. The NCSE are currently processing these applications and schools will be notified by SENOs of their SNA allocations for 2013/14 in advance of the coming school year, based on the number of valid applications received.</p><p>  Where a school considers that it has not received a sufficient quantum of SNA support to cater for the care needs of all qualifying children, the school may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.  Whereas there is no prescriptive timeframe before which a review may take place, it will be expected that schools, before requesting any such review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage any SNA allocation that has already been made to their school to best effect.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

I acknowledge that the various budget measures that have taken place in recent years can limit the employment opportunities for newly qualified teachers. However, there are limits to the number of teaching posts that we can afford to fund as a country.</p><p>  The redeployment of surplus permanent teachers is the first mechanism to fill teaching posts in schools. This is key to the ability of my Department to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.  There are standard arrangements in place for filling any remaining vacancies which gives employment opportunities for teachers on fixed-term or part-time contracts and also newly qualified teachers.</p><p>  Data from the 2011 census show a significant increase in the numbers of people identifying themselves as teachers since the 2006 census. That increase is substantial even in relation to other occupations which also had an increase. Census data for 2011 show unemployment among this group, at 3.5%, well below the national average.  That said, I am aware that there are newly qualified teachers not yet holding teaching positions in schools and measures have been taken to alleviate difficulties for new teachers.  My Department has directed managerial authorities of schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones, in an effort to ease the difficulties for those who cannot find work in the profession.</p><p>  In addition, the JobBridge National Internship Scheme can provide newly qualified teachers with opportunities to gain experience and to undertake the necessary teaching duties to complete the process of probation. The minimum service requirement for probation purposes in order to secure registration with the Teaching Council was decreased from 170 days to 100 days in the 2011/2012 school year. </p></reply>

This equates to an additional 38 classrooms at a pupil teacher ratio of 28:1.  Given the scale of the demand, it is clear that the three schools in the immediate vicinity would not be able to meet it.  The new schools are, therefore, being established to both ensure that no pupil is without a place and to add to the choice of school type available to parents.  In addition, further lands are zoned for residential development in the area concerned.  The proposed new schools will be well placed to meet any future development in this regard.</p></reply>

A total of 10 proposals were received. </p><p>  These proposals were examined by an independent selection panel against the evaluation criteria which were an integral part of the Expression of Interest procedure. On the basis of the review carried out by the panel at the initial stage of the process, four proposals were short-listed for oral presentation. Following oral presentation these proposals were assigned a ranking depending on their relative strengths under each of the evaluation criteria leading to the preferred proposal.   The selection panel evaluated the proposals under each of the following criteria:</p><p> - Organisational capacity to perform the function;</p><p> - Experience in dealing with comparable schemes/services;</p><p> - Existing core management, expertise and resources available to be deployed to the function;</p><p> - Capacity to deliver strong cost and efficiency benefits;</p><p> - Overall quality of the proposal for delivery of a central student grants function.</p><p>  Following this process, the selection panel made a recommendation to the Minister for Education and Skills on the preferred proposal which was the City of Dublin VEC proposal to establish Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) as a unit of that VEC.  While indicative delivery costs were provided by each of the bodies, they were not as such tender prices, as this was an expression of interest process. These indicative costs were considered under the evaluation criteria which examined the capacity of the bodies to deliver strong cost and efficiency benefits. Each of the short-listed proposals was marked under all of the evaluation criteria heading.</p><p>  City of Dublin VEC was designated as the single grant awarding authority and operated on a transitional basis accepting all new applications for the 2012/13 academic year. The independent review of the first year of operation of SUSI was commissioned by City of Dublin VEC and carried out by Accenture.

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers. The application process for the supplementary panels was introduced for the 2012/13 school year.</p><p>  The arrangements for panel access for fixed term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers for the 2013/14 school year are set out in Department Circular 0038/2012 which was published on 9 November 2012 on the Department website.  The period for submitting applications was between 9 November 2012 and 14 December 2012. The circular made clear that late applications would not be considered. The Department has received a number of applications after the closing date which will not be processed.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. In making any changes to our supports for children with special needs consultation will be a key aspect in the implementation of any recommendations.</p></reply>

Taking into account all of the research reviewed and submissions and presentations received, the Anti-Bullying Working Group that produced the Action Plan did not recommend a particular anti-bullying programme. However, they did recommend nine principles that should underpin a school's approach to preventing and tackling bullying.  These are:</p><p>- A positive school culture and climate.</p><p>- A school wide approach.</p><p>- Effective leadership.</p><p>- A shared understanding of what bullying is and its impact.</p><p>- Anti-bullying policies.</p><p>- Consistent recording of reported bullying behaviour.</p><p>- Education and training.</p><p>- Prevention strategies including awareness raising.</p><p>- Established evidence-based intervention strategies.</p><p>  It is therefore open to schools that have developed effective initiatives aimed at combatting bullying and cyber-bullying through transition year projects to use these for junior cycle classes if they so wish.</p><p>  The NCCA is designing a range of short courses which will be available to schools from September 2014 including a short course in SPHE. Schools may choose to incorporate these short courses into their junior cycle programme either for certification purposes or not for certification. They may choose not to opt for the new short course and may choose to continue to use existing courses or other approaches to meet the Framework's Principles, Statements of Learning and Key Skills relevant to these areas. Schools will have the flexibility to determine how best to meet the range of Statements of Learning, Key Skills and Principles that relate to the areas currently covered in SPHE.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle which I published last October will, inter alia, aim to increase the importance of physical wellbeing in several ways.  The Framework is based on eight Principles.  The Principle of &quot;Wellbeing&quot; undertakes to ensure that &quot;the student experience contributes directly to their physical wellbeing.&quot;  The Principle of &quot;Inclusive Education&quot; undertakes to ensure that &quot;the educational experience is inclusive of all students and contributes to equality of opportunity, participation and outcomes for all&quot;.  Contained in the Junior Cycle's Statements of Learning is the stated aim that the student &quot;takes action to safeguard and promote his/her wellbeing and that of others&quot;.</p><p>  In addition, eight Key Skills are required for successful learning across the curriculum and beyond the school.  This is in recognition of the fact that learning takes place both inside and outside of the formal school environment. One of these Key Skills is &quot;Staying Well&quot;, which adopts a holistic approach to wellbeing and includes &quot;Being healthy, physical and active&quot;. </p></reply>

The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts for the 2013/2014 school year is set out in the Staffing Schedule (Circular 0013/2013) which is available on the Department website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p><p>  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.

If the immigrant child enters the primary school in senior classes he/she may be exempt from learning Irish in order to concentrate on learning English if this is the medium of instruction. In fact, all children are usually involved in activities that relate both to Irish language and culture in the daily life of their class.</p></reply>

I will seek to publish the Bill in draft form to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and the education partners. I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted.  In bringing forward these proposals, it is not my intention to unnecessarily intrude into how schools do their business. My policy objective is to ensure that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.   As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

The NCCA has embarked on major reforms of the curricula in Irish for primary, junior cycle and senior cycle. As the NCCA work progresses, COGG will concurrently and collaboratively be creating resource materials to support the teaching and learning  of Irish in both Irish medium schools and also in English medium schools.

The school in question was established to become a fully vertical school that would grow incrementally each year and develop naturally over time to become a 16 mainstream teacher school. The school was recognised to be one of a number of primary schools that would meet the current and future needs in the area. The granting of recognition by my Department was on that understanding and this position has not changed.  On this basis, the school would be expected to enrol a maximum of two Junior Infant classes annually and to fill its 16-classrooms on an incremental basis each year, culminating ultimately in two classes of each stream up to sixth standard.</p><p>  My Department has previously communicated its views to this effect to both the Board of Management and Patron. My Department is aware that the Patron has also conveyed his views, which coincide with those of my Department, to the Board of Management and has directed the Board to take appropriate action to rectify the situation that currently prevails.</p><p>  My Department has no role in the matter of the enrolment practices of individual schools and it would be inappropriate for me to appoint an arbitrator as proposed. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. My Department considers that the 16-classroom building for the school in question, together with the existing primary schools, provides sufficient primary school capacity in this area.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.However, at a time of severely reduced resources, priorities have to be made. In an effort to ensure fairness in the education system, the PTR in fee charging second level schools will rise by two points to 23:1 in September 2013.</p><p>  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately. This is an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by my Department was recently published and shows that the schools in question have &euro;81m in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have. It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the Budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable.</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that this Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of these posts is in the order of &euro;100 million. The Deputy will be aware that in the context of the Budget 2013, I made a further one point change to the staffing allocation of fee charging schools from September 2013. Given the extremely difficult economic circumstances that this country is facing and the fact that every Department has to find considerable cost-savings, all expenditure must be examined to see if cost-savings can be found. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage anticipate any specific decisions the Government may take in respect of the next budget.  This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice. There are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant block grant. </p></reply>

Class A rate PRSI payment brings with it an entitlement to a state pension payable by the Department of Social Protection. The State pension becomes payable at age 65. As some public servants (particularly teachers) retire significantly earlier than age 65, their occupational pension may, on application and subject to certain criteria, be augmented by the payment of a supplementary pension by the occupational pension provider. The purpose in paying a supplementary pension is to ensure that such public servants who paid Class A rate PRSI are not disadvantaged in the period between their retirement and their receipt of the state pension.</p><p>  One of the conditions attaching to the award of a supplementary pension is that its payment should cease or be reduced, as appropriate, where the pensioner becomes entitled to a state pension. Cessation of the supplementary pension occurs where the rate of state pension payable is greater than the rate of the supplementary pension which was in payment. The person to whom the Deputy refers applied for and was awarded a supplementary pension following retirement from teaching. It has been established that the person to whom the Deputy refers is currently receiving a State pension. As a result of this, payment of supplementary pension from my Department has been discontinued. Payment of the occupational pension continues in the normal way. While my Department must cease payment of the supplementary pension in accordance with the terms of the statutory pension scheme, the issues raised by the person to whom the Deputy refers will be addressed in a sensitive manner.</p></reply>

Its research provides a valuable input to the development of course curricula and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs, including Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion programmes. Springboard provides free part-time higher education courses for unemployed people in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities. More than 10,000 places have been provided under the two rounds of the programme to date. A new call for proposals for courses to be run under Springboard 2013 issued by the Higher Education Authority in February 2013 and a new round of programmes will be announced next month.</p><p>  The joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan has been developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages and contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes. Over 700 people have been supported under the first phase of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes which commenced in March 2012. A total of 423 people are due to graduate from these programmes by the end of this month and the remainder will graduate before the end of the year. In February 2013 more than 760 new places were made available on the conversion programmes in higher education institutions around the country. There are 6,500 training places are currently being rolled out for unemployed people under the Momentum programme. The training, which is aligned up to levels 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications, is targeted at areas of labour market demand and there is a particular focus on the needs of unemployed people under the age of 25.</p><p>  Funding is also provided to Skillnets, where the development of training is led by representatives of industry ensuring that training provision meets the needs of the sector. In addition, a range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to respond to enterprise needs is being implemented through the National Strategy for Higher Education, including the development of an annual employer survey. The creation of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will also ensure an increased focus on the evolving skills requirements of industry.</p></reply>

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2011/12 school year. The national average class size is 24.4 pupils. However, with over 20,700 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p><p>  Classroom teachers are allocated under the staffing schedule based on the pupil enrolments for the previous 30 September. However, the staffing schedule also includes provision for schools that have significant increases in their enrolment in rapidly developing areas to be allocated classroom teachers based on their projected enrolments for September 2013. The criteria for this are set out in the staffing schedule which is available on the Department website. Given the constraints on teacher numbers my Department has no capacity to put any other ameliorating measures in place. The Deputy will be aware that the Government has protected frontline services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013/14 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p></reply>

While this Government has undertaken to protect education spending as much as possible, we are not operating in a vacuum and efforts to secure savings have had to be made in the education sector also. The 2013 gross Voted expenditure allocation of &euro;8,507 million for my Department, as set out in the recently published Revised Estimates Volume, represents an approximately 1% reduction on the expenditure outturn for 2012. Despite this reduction I have been able to protect front line services to the extent that there will be no increase in average class size at primary level and no increase in the general pupil-teacher ratio at second level. Budget 2013 actually provided for an extra net 900 teachers in schools in the 2013/14 year to cater for upward demographic pressures. In addition, special needs services are also protected, while the DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected, with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of this Budget.</p><p>  While Budget 2013 required the implementation of some difficult savings measures in areas of the education sector and, while I would prefer to be in a position to allocate more resources across the sector, I am nevertheless confident that we can achieve much with what we have, through efficient and effective use of the resources that have been allocated to my Department for 2013. My Department continues to closely review the financial position during 2013 with a view to ensuring that expenditure remains within the allocation for this year.</p></reply>

As part of the Action Plan, new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and second level schools are currently in development in consultation with the education partners. These new procedures will include a specific reference to cyber bullying and to requirements for noting and reporting bullying incidents. These will be issued to all schools at the beginning of the next school year.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts are available for allocation to schools by the NCSE throughout the school year, subject to qualifying applications being received. The number of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts available for allocation has been maintained at a time when there has been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas.</p><p>  The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. All children who have qualified for such support this year have been provided with access to SNA support. The NCSE requested all schools to submit their applications for SNA support for the coming school year to them by 15th March, 2013, and will advise all schools of their SNA allocations prior to the start of the new school year, based on the number of valid applications received. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing process for the 2013/14 school year at individual school level is currently underway. The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are set out in the annual staffing arrangements. The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p></reply>

My Department funds the provision of over 430,000 part-time and full-time places across the further and higher education and training sectors, all of which are open to young people under 25 years of age. This provision includes the recently developed and flexible re-skilling opportunities specifically for unemployed people in areas of emerging skills needs under Momentum initiatives. The introduction of the MOMENTUM programme will have a specific impact on young unemployed people. It is to provide a range of quality, relevant education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long-term unemployed. Training will be provided within the context of four themes all of which are open to under 25 year olds. One of these themes will focus on the specific needs of people under 25 and 800 places are being made available specifically for this.</p><p>  For early school leavers, my Department funds 6,000 places under the Youthreach programme. The programme provides participants with two years integrated education, training and work experience which facilitates early school leavers with opportunities to acquire certification and progress to further education, training or employment. A weekly training allowance is paid to learners on some further education and training programmes. Learners who are under 25 will be paid an allowance of &euro;160 per week, which is higher than the Jobseekers Allowance rates of &euro;100 for those aged 18 to 21 and &euro;144 for those aged 22 to 24. The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme funded by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further and higher education. Latest figures show over 6,700 young people under 25 years of age are in receipt of the BTEA, 56% of whom are second level and 44% third level. Statistics on the number of under 25s enrolled in further education and training programmes for each of the past five years is being collated at present and will be forwarded separately to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Pre-School project referred to is not a designated Primary or Special School, but a stand-alone project in receipt of an individual resourcing mechanism which is separate to the resourcing arrangements which apply to mainstream and Special schools, including supports which are provided to mainstream and Special schools to support pupils with special educational needs. </p><p>  The Pre-School referred to by the Deputy in her question is in receipt of significant supports from my Department. In 2012 my Department provided support to the value of approximately &euro;740,000 to this Pre-School. The provision included staffing of an Administrative Principal, 6 teachers and 5 child care workers catering for 95 children, a pupil to adult ratio of approximately 8:1.  In addition to the teaching and child care provision, the project receives an annual grant from my Department to fund non-teaching pay costs which provides for the employment of a cook, cleaner and a secretary. My Department also provides funding towards the non-pay or running costs of the project.  Finally, I wish to clarify that the funding awarded to the Project is based on budget proposals submitted by the each year. The funding awarded by my Department for 2012 matched the proposals submitted.</p></reply>

There is a very serious disturbance in the economy and a serious crisis in revenue.  Ireland is availing of financial assistance programmes provided by the IMF and the EU and has undertaken to meet spending targets in that regard.  </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the then Government decided in 2010, in light of the  national budgetary position, that retired public service pensioners should make a contribution to the overall required fiscal adjustment, by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  This decision was taken having regard to the gap between the burden being borne by those currently in public service employment (where the pension related deduction (PRD) and pay reduction have impacted) and their retired counterparts.  <font color="#104160">This</font> Government's intention to require a further contribution to the fiscal consolidation effort from Public Service pensioners with pensions in excess of &euro;32,500, is one element in the wider plan to restore stability to the public finances. The scale of consolidation required can only be achieved with a contribution from all of the main components of public expenditure.  None of the measures were or are being done lightly but are considered necessary in view of the wide gap between our revenues and our expenditure, and in view also of our commitment to restore order to the public finances by reducing the general Government deficit to less than 3%  by 2015.</p><p>  Any reduction in pension payments is, of course, a serious step. However, the grave condition of the public finances and the threat to Ireland's economic wellbeing provide the context for such exceptional measures.  I would note, for the Deputy's information  that the first &euro;12,000 of pension is exempt from the PSPR, and that the bands and rates of the PSPR are progressively structured so that persons on lower pensions are proportionately less affected than those on higher pensions. The additional reductions planned for 1 July 2013  will be confined to pensions in payment greater than &euro;32,500 only.  As I indicated to the Alliance of Retired Public Servants when I met with them yesterday, I hope to move towards reducing the burden of the public service pension reduction when economic progress permits.</p></reply>

Growth in Good Cause Revenues will ensure that contributions to Good Causes are maximised over the period of the new licence.</p><p>The precise percentage of Gross Gaming Revenues which will be allocated to Good Causes will be determined prior to the launch of the licence competition when a number of other matters in relation to the licence structure and licence competition will also be decided.

The latest tables which detail this progress to end Quarter 1 2013 can be found at:</p><p><i>http://per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Public-Service-Rationalisation-Measures-end-Q1-2013.pdf</i></p><p>In summary, the tables show that significant progress has been made by Departments on the implementation of agreed rationalisation measures.  To date, rationalisation and amalgamation measures involving 25 bodies have been fully implemented, and measures involving a further 83 bodies are at advanced legislative or administrative stages.  Further measures, involving 107 bodies, were identified under a critical review process undertaken in 2012 as part of the Public Service Reform Plan.  The majority of these measures will be implemented in 2013.</p><p>On the issue of savings, the Public Service Reform Plan aimed to secure &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money from the rationalisation programme, a target which will be achieved.  The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the merged entities.</p><p>From the outset we have maintained that the lasting and most important benefit from the rationalisation of State Bodies will be a less crowded administrative landscape resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  Moreover, the rationalisation programme needs to be understood as just one of a package of reform measures that will allow for the continued delivery of critical services against the backdrop of public service numbers. There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  These savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the number of State Bodies that still exist, as I have stated before in previous PQs, there are three broad categories of State Bodies.  Firstly, there are a number of Offices of State which typically are staffed by Civil Servants and have their own Vote for the allocation of public monies and which are within a Vote Group. A list of these bodies is set out in Appendix 1.</p><p>Secondly there are non-commercial State Bodies who are usually staffed by Public Servants and funded (or part funded) through a grant-in-aid from their parent Department. Details of such bodies are set out in the Detailed Expenditure Information on Non-Commercial State Agencies included in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2013, which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>http://per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/REVISED-ESTIMATES-VOLUME-2013-final.pdf</i>.</p><p>Beyond that within each Department there are many other executive offices, divisions and directorates, operational or consultative groupings, task groups or forums that exist for various purposes that might or might not meet the definition of &lsquo;entity&rsquo;.

As part of that plan we are undertaking a steady and managed reduction in public service numbers.  There is not a wholesale embargo on recruitment, indeed there is quite significant recruitment in targeted priority areas such as health and education.  </p><p>  Quite sensibly, the Government is taking a measured and prudent approach to mitigate the potential disadvantages of reduced staffing levels.  To this end, the numbers reduction policy:</p><p> - takes account of priority areas, by allowing for replacement of key staff especially in the education sector and in key areas of health;</p><p> - gives sectoral and local management discretion in exactly how staff resources are allocated within an area;</p><p> - provides a framework for redeployment of staff across the public service;</p><p> - and includes introducing new streamlined services such as shared services, which allow functions to be maintained and indeed enhanced with reduced staff levels and at a lower cost.</p><p>  Reform of the public service is necessary both because we need to reduce costs given our serious fiscal position, and because the quality of public services for the citizen needs to be continually improved and value-for-money for the taxpayer protected.  The Government's reform plan is comprehensive and ambitious.  It captures a wide range of reform projects, including:</p><p> - ICT infrastructure projects to support enhanced automation, better online services and shared payroll and HR services;</p><p> - Change management projects  to support more effective work practices, redeployment,  rostering and manpower planning;</p><p> - Organisation restructuring, involving mergers of previously separate state bodies and of divisions and work areas within organisations.</p><p>  These reform projects will allow the public service to function more efficiently and more cost effectively over the medium term. Crucially, they are facilitating the delivery of services while making headcount reduction.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on . </p><p>  The Boards are required to give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. Retail enterprises are ineligible for financial support from the CEBs as it is considered that these generally give rise to concerns over displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market).  However they can avail of non-financial assistance in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. </p><p>  In addition, Microfinance Ireland is providing support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 available to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs also includes a number of measures designed to help the retail sector.  These include a project to streamline the application process for business licences in the retail sector, and an initiative to encourage more businesses to trade on-line.  Developments on these initiatives will be reported on a quarterly basis on my Department's website, , as part of the Action Plan for Jobs Progress Reports.</p></reply>

The Government considers this project to be of significant importance and has positioned it as one of the Disruptive Reforms in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.  Such an integrated licensing system, which will streamline the licensing application process, is a reformative step in reducing the administrative burdens for business.  Delivering an integrated licensing system, in the first instance for the retail sector by the end of the year, will require the firm and on-going commitment and engagement of the relevant licensing authorities to work closely with my Department and with Forf&aacute;s.</p><p>  A key goal of the proposed system is to support the licence application process through the provision of a single portal or website through which businesses will be able to apply for, and renew, a multiplicity of licences.  I should stress that this system will not interfere with the policy aims of the regulations that underpin existing licences.  The relevant licensing authorities will continue to authorise and enforce the licences in the usual way.

My Department has received that advice.  The matter at issue was whether early application of the Directive&rsquo;s provisions was permissible having regard to the wording of the Directive&rsquo;s transposition provision and the constitutional and legislative provisions governing the implementation of European Union legislation in Ireland.  Article 28 (Transposition) of the Consumer Rights Directive requires Member States to adopt the laws or regulations necessary to comply with the Directive by 13 December 2013, and to apply those laws or regulations from 13 June 2014. </p><p>  The legal advice available to me states largely that early application and enforcement of the directive by way of secondary legislation could be successfully challenged under domestic constitutional law.  It noted among other things that Article 29.4.10 of the Constitution provides blanket constitutional immunity for all measures &lsquo;necessitated&rsquo; by our membership of the European Union. In view of the wording of the transposition provision at Article 28 of the Directive, however, it was open to question whether the application of the Directive&rsquo;s provisions prior to the date specified in the Directive could be said to be &lsquo;necessitated&rsquo; by the obligations of European Union membership.  While there was no obstacle to early adoption of the Directive&rsquo;s provisions by means of statutory instrument, the application and enforcement of those provisions before June 2014 by secondary legislation could be successfully challenged in the courts. </p><p>  Accordingly I have reluctantly decided not to proceed with the early implementation of these Articles.  It would not be in the interest of consumer protection to have court proceedings arising from the enforcement of these Articles fail on a matter relating to the timing of that enforcement rather than on the substance of the case.  Articles 19 and 22 will accordingly be given effect in Regulations to be enacted by December 2013 and to be applied from June 2014.  These Regulations will also give effect to the other provisions of the Directive.  My Department has drawn the European Commission&rsquo;s attention to the difficulties caused by the particular form of wording used for the transposition provision at Article 28 of the Directive with a view to ensuring that a similar difficulty will not arise with future European Union consumer protection legislation.</p></reply>

Of major importance from an Irish perspective is the revision of the Regional Aid Guidelines.  The purpose of Regional Aid is to support investment and job creation and encourage firms to set up new establishments in Europe's most disadvantaged regions.</p><p>  The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines is underway and multilateral discussions between Member States and the Commission, which has responsibility for the Regional Aid Guidelines, have taken place.  This initiative is Commission led, and my Department is actively engaged in the process and has consulted relevant stakeholders including various Government Departments, the enterprise development agencies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forf&aacute;s, the Central Statistics Office, the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, and the eight Regional Authorities to ensure the preparation and submission of a comprehensive evidence based Irish position on the key issues.</p><p>  The Commission issued a non-paper of its initial orientations in December 2011, which was followed by a multilateral meeting in March 2012. The Commission subsequently forwarded further proposals to Member States on 14 January 2013, documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines.  These proposals were again discussed at a multilateral meeting on 11 and 12 of February 2013.  I met directly with Commissioner Almunia to discuss the issue of State Aids in December 2012.  Minister Sherlock has also raised this issue with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn.  Concerns relating to the range of coverage and support for large enterprises were raised at these meetings as being items of major concern to Ireland.</p><p>  In addition, my Departments officials are in regular discussions on these issues with Commission officials across a range of dossiers, to ensure that Irish concerns are well known within the Commission.  My officials are also liaising with a number of like-minded Member States on the issue.  All relevant Government Departments are being kept briefed on this issue through the State Aid Interdepartmental Committee and briefs have issued to all relevant Minsters.  All Irish MEPs and the Irish representatives on the Council of the Regions are also being briefed on this issue.</p><p>  A revised proposal on Regional Aid will shortly be circulated through the Commission as part of the normal inter-service consultation.  My Department, in conjunction with the enterprise agencies, is in the process of preparing a detailed submission to the Commission on this revised proposal.  The next meeting of the College of Commissioners is scheduled for Wednesday, 19 June 2013.  Once the Regional Proposal has been agreed by the College it will be formally adopted and published by DG Competition.</p></reply>

Two of those initiatives have come to fruition with the adoption of the European Company (the &ldquo;SE&rdquo;), which is a public limited company, in 2001 and of the European Cooperative (the &ldquo;SCE&rdquo;) in 2006.  A proposal from the Commission for a European Foundation, akin to a charity, has begun its passage through the European Parliament and Council, and my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality is leading the Irish position on this. </p><p>  A proposal from the European Commission to introduce a European Private Company (the &ldquo;SPE&rdquo;), introduced in 2008, is not being advanced at this point as Member States were not able to find common ground on certain key features.  In light of this impasse, the Commission signalled in its recent Action Plan on European company law and corporate governance (published 12 December 2012) that it will spend time this year and next considering alternatives that would enhance cross-border opportunities for SMEs, such as proposals for mechanisms that would make it easier for companies to establish in other EU Member States without undue administrative burden.  The main area of likely action here is a possible proposal on transfer of registered office, so that companies can move to another EU Member State without having to first wind up in their home state.  Again, the Commission&rsquo;s Action Plan on European company law and corporate governance states that the Commission will investigate options and may bring forward a proposal within the next year or so. </p><p>  Officials in my Department have had discussions with both other Member States and the Commission on all of these proposals, with the exception of the European Foundation where the Department of Justice and Equality takes the lead, in the context of the Council negotiations, the Commission&rsquo;s Company Law Expert Group and / or as part of our preparations for the Irish Presidency programme as each arose on the EU&rsquo;s company law agenda over the last few years. </p></reply>

In executing its mandate, IDA Ireland engages with corporate entities, as the primary decision makers around FDI investment.  The Agency&rsquo;s key focus is on maximising the level of economic activity and substance in Ireland from these corporations.</p><p>  IDA Ireland markets Ireland as a location for FDI on the basis of a number of selling points: a pro-business and technologically advanced environment; the availability of an educated and talented workforce with the blend of appropriate skill sets; a range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions; the availability of world class access infrastructure, for example, road access to key cities and ports and international airports; and an attractive corporate tax rate.  IDA Ireland is a marketing organisation not a tax advisory body.  In the course of its engagement with client companies, IDA Ireland provides general information to companies on the Irish tax regime while companies and their financial advisors engage separately and directly with the Revenue Commissioners, as required.</p><p>  I wish to reiterate that Ireland is not a tax haven.  Since the 1950s, there has been a consistent Government policy to use a competitive corporation tax rate as a means to attract investment and jobs to Ireland.  A deliberate decision has been taken by successive Governments to ensure that our tax system is transparent and our competitive rate is applied to a wider tax base.  I understand from my colleague the Minister for Finance that he has been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of companies and the names of same that are incorporated here but non-resident for tax purposes are not available as they are not separately compiled.</p></reply>

That company employs over 2,500 staff in this country.  In the 33 years since establishing in Ireland, Apple&rsquo;s entire operation has been paid &euro;17,854,407 in grant assistance from IDA Ireland in support of its major corporate activities in Cork. That company employs approximately 4,000 staff in Ireland. </p><p>  Given the number of employees working in each company in Ireland, if all were just earning the average wage then the tax revenue for the Exchequer each year would be of the order of &euro;6,400 per worker in PAYE and USC payments or &euro;41m per year in aggregate.  This figure is likely to be much larger as staff at both these companies would likely be earning above the average wage.</p><p>  In the course of its engagement with client companies, IDA Ireland provides general information to companies on the Irish tax regime.  However the IDA is not a tax advisory body. Obviously companies and their financial advisors engage separately and directly with the Revenue Commissioners as required.    IDA Ireland engages with corporate entities, as the primary decision makers around FDI investment.  The Agency&rsquo;s key focus is on maximising the level of economic activity and substance in Ireland from these corporations.  Large companies generally have a significant number of subsidiaries within their overall corporate structure. </p><p>  In relation to Apple, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in the past 30 years is has been with Apple Corporate and with its Irish operation in Cork.  Over this period, the Agency has met with Apple frequently in relation to the execution of its mandate.  Distinctions would not normally be made as to whether or not specific subsidiaries might be involved in particular meetings. </p></reply>

The <i>Jobs Plus</i> initiative is one of a series of strategic and reforming measures being implemented by Government. It incentivises businesses to hire jobseekers who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more. All of the measures in the Action Plan for Jobs are designed to promote employment opportunities in different ways and many graduates will benefit from the implementation of these measures.</p><p>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of Government policy on activation and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency. This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments. The major elements of the Government's response to targeting activation places and opportunities as set out in the Pathways to Work policy is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.</p><p>  The Government will spend more than &euro;1 billion this year on supporting over 85,000 job placements, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries, including through the &#8220;<i>JobBridge&#8221;</i>   internship programme. Many young graduates will benefit from these opportunities. In addition, over 450,000 education and training places will be provided in the higher education, further education and training sectors. <i>JobBridge</i>, the national internship programme, is providing valuable work experience for many young people, including graduates.  A recent independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progress to paid employment after completing their internships. The Indecon evaluation clearly demonstrates that <i>JobBridge</i>   is delivering for thousands of jobseekers by providing them with valuable opportunities to gain relevant work experience, knowledge and skills in a workplace environment. An increase in the number of places on the scheme, from 6,000 to 8,500, was announced in Budget 2013.</p><p>  Further measures outlined in Ireland's National Reform Programme update for 2013, submitted by the Government to the European Commission in April, include further implementation of the ICT Action Plan, including the provision of 760 additional places on the ICT Graduate Conversion Programme. These programmes, which are designed and delivered in partnership with industry, are targeted at graduate jobseekers who wish to acquire honours degree level programming skills for employment opportunities in ICT.</p><p>  In addition, the Labour Market Education &amp;amp; Training Fund, known as <i>Momentum</i>  , will provide a range of quality, relevant education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long term unemployed, including graduates. While participation in these programmes is conditional on recruitment from the Live Register, nonetheless all are available to graduates who find themselves unemployed.  The Government's primary strategy to support job creation is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery is essential to underpin jobs growth and to provide the opportunities sought by young graduates.</p></reply>

Where the employee&rsquo;s weekly earnings exceed &euro;352 per week, employee PRSI at 4% is payable on all income.  The rate of employer PRSI increases from 4.25% to 10.75%, once weekly earnings exceed &euro;356.  There is no anomaly in the operation of the PRSI system.  When employees moves to a higher earnings band they and their employer pay PRSI at the rate appropriate to the new band. </p><p>  You will appreciate that in order to fund the social insurance entitlements of employees, contributions from both employees and employers are necessary.  Lower rates of PRSI are charged on those with lower levels of earnings. Employees earning less than &euro;352 per week do not pay employee PRSI.  Employee PRSI at 4% is only payable where weekly earnings exceed &euro;352. In relation to employer PRSI, the lower rate applying to earnings between &euro;38 and &euro;356 was reduced from 8.5% to 4.25% in July 2011, as part of the Jobs Initiative to meet one of the Programme for Government commitments.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  The Government is implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:</p><p>  - The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;</p><p>  - The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;</p><p>  - The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;</p><p>  - Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses;</p><p>  - This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;</p><p>  - The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700;</p><p>  - Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register;</p><p>  - In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people. </p><p>  With regard to targets, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In this context, the Department of Finance anticipates that the overall unemployment rate will fall from 14.7% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2016.  This could be expected to see youth unemployment fall from over 30% in 2012 to 24% or less in 2016. </p><p>  In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  Specifically, these targets are that:</p><p>  (i) at least 75,000 of long-term unemployed people will move into employment by 2015 (starting 2012). </p><p>  (ii) Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015 </p><p>  (iii) Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed)  to 25%. </p><p>As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people. </p><p>  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.</p><p>  Following from the formal adoption of the EU Recommendation on Implementing a Youth Guarantee, the Government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012 was at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  </p><p>  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment. It is to be hoped that any measures taken by government in relation to the implementation of the youth guarantee will see youth unemployment fall even further than is already anticipated on the basis of existing policies.</p></reply>

They provide a second opinion to that of the person&rsquo;s own doctor.  Their assessments conform to the ethical conduct and behaviour guidelines of the Irish Medical Council.  These medical assessments involve comprehensive examination of the person&rsquo;s medical history and clinical evaluation from the client&rsquo;s own primary healthcare provider (GP) and all available current medical evidence. They also involve a review of any investigation results and specialist/consultant reports.  Cases which relate to conditions of mental disability, including suicidal ideation and depression, are accepted as medical evidence and considered in arriving at decisions for these schemes. The assessment is made in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s evidence-based medical guidelines and protocols which include as key indicators suicidal ideation and depression. All medical evidence is taken into consideration and no medical evidence is ever discounted. </p><p>  There are currently twenty two Medical Assessors, including the Chief Medical Advisor and Deputy Chief Medical Advisor, who conduct medical assessments across a wide range of the Department's schemes.  Of these, six have post-graduate qualifications in the area of mental health, such as MRCPsych and Dip. Clinical Psychiatry.  They also have extensive clinical training and experience in psychiatry together with membership of recognised professional bodies such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists London and the College of Psychiatry Ireland. The Medical Assessors have an on-going commitment to continuing medical education to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced. This includes working in a collegiate way to ensure that best practice and professional expertise is shared and applied across all of the cases that are reviewed by them.  Daily case conference meetings are held and a medical research unit has been established to actively engage in the update of the body of medical knowledge and evidence based practice.  Furthermore, as a result of a recent recruitment campaign for Medical Assessors, seven were recruited of whom two have mental health qualifications - MRCPsych.  Further recruitment of Medical Assessors is underway.</p></reply>

The &euro;100 rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009.  A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  </p><p>  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.  </p><p>  I met with Focus Ireland on 15 May, 2013 to discuss a number of issues in relation to homelessness, including the situation of young persons in receipt of reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, and officials are in on-going contact with them in relation to their concerns.  While the primary issue in this regard is a housing issue rather than one of income support, the Department of Social Protection has an important role in the delivery of solutions to homelessness. Generally, this role relates to income maintenance where homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes subject to the normal qualifying conditions, but the Department also engages in inter-agency responses to homelessness.  In this context, the Department will continue to engage with Focus Ireland, and other actors, in relation to issues relating to rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for persons under the age of 25.</p></reply>

The employment initiatives include the National Internship Scheme - JobBridge, Community Employment Schemes and T&uacute;s.

Voluntary groups may be locally or nationally organised and may include community groups.</p><p>  The aim of the voluntary work option is twofold, namely to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseekers to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work; and to inform jobseekers of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so.  The number of persons who availed of the voluntary work option in 2011 was 169 and 234 in 2012. Statistics for 2010 were not maintained and are not available.  It should also be noted that unemployed people may undertake voluntary work while seeking employment without informing the Department. </p><p>  The Department also engages with an interdepartmental group which is examining ways in which unemployed people can be facilitated and encouraged to participate in voluntary work to learn new skills and stay close to the Labour Market.</p></reply>

The eligibility of those in receipt of other payments including Blind Pension to participate in JobBridge will be kept under review.</p><p>  However, I wish to advise that there are other activation measures available to assist those in receipt of Blind Pension such as the Work Placement Programme which specifies the minimum number of hours to be undertaken as 25 per week.  JobBridge is a targeted labour market activation intervention intended to <font color="#2F2F2F">assist jobseekers to break the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience, </font>to provide those seeking employment with the opportunity to gain work experience, maintain close links with the labour market and to enhance their skills and competencies through an internship opportunity, thereby improving their prospects of securing employment in the future<font color="#2F2F2F">. The scheme gives individuals a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap to the beginning of the rest of their working lives.</font></p><p>  Providing they fulfil all JobBridge eligibility criteria, persons in part-time employment are currently entitled to take part in the JobBridge scheme. However, the part-time employment must not interfere with the intern's ability to undertake the weekly hours of their internship.  The total period of qualifying payment or claim must be 78 days or more in the past 6 months prior to participation on JobBridge.  Time spent on certain training programmes or schemes may also count towards eligibility.</p></reply>

The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. </p><p>  New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  The general practice is that rent supplement is not paid where the rent is above the relevant limit. However, rent supplement may be paid where the rent is above the relevant limit in the following circumstances:</p><p>  - Where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances (in particular, for example, a person with a disability in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons whose housing needs cannot be met within the standard terms of the rent supplement scheme etc.);</p><p>  - Where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.  "Sufficient income" in this context means the relevant basic supplementary welfare allowance rate less the prescribed minimum contribution to rent; and/or</p><p>  - Where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period.  For this purpose, a guideline period of no longer than 6 to 8 weeks is suggested but where there are exceptional circumstances, an extension up to a total of 12 weeks may be allowed.</p><p>  Statistics are not available on the number of rent supplement claims where payments are made in excess of the prescribed limits.</p></reply>

In December 2012, there were approximately 14,400 customers in receipt of SPT.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for changes to State pension age. From 1 January 2014,  the abolition of SPT will standardise the age for payment of a State pension to 66 years.  In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2021 and to 68 years from 2028.</p><p>  The existence of the SPT is historical and relates to the qualifying age for SPC which, up until the early 1970s, was 70 years of age.  SPT (known then as the Retirement Pension) was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65.  The qualifying age for SPC was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left SPT effective for just one year.  The abolition of SPT removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive for people to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment. There is no retirement condition attached to the SPC. </p><p>  The sustainability of pensions in the future requires longer working.  The OECD report states in its recent Review of the Irish Pensions System states that the immediate concern for Ireland is to increase effective retirement age by encouraging longer working. This applies to those who wish to work past pension age but also, (as evidenced by the figures produced below) to those who exit the workforce early prior to reaching pension age.  </p><p>  With regard to the impact of the abolition of SPT in 2014, the award figures for SPT over a number of years have been analysed.  The numbers impacted demonstrate that many people leave the workforce some years before pension age, more so than might have been perceived. In addition, low numbers of people in employment are impacted by the abolition of SPT.  A person who retires from work on reaching age 65 may apply for another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.  In relation to job seekers, there are already a number of special transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66.  Existing legislation provides that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose job seekers benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will not be subject to the reductions in duration. </p><p>  In February 2012, my Department held meetings with the representative groups for older people to outline the changes to SPT and SPC. Feedback was sought from these groups and included in an information pack that was prepared to further publicise the changes to the scheme.  The finalised information pack was published in early March 2012 on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie and the link sent on twitter. It was also made available through the Citizens Information Board website www.citizensinformation.ie.  It was widely circulated to customer representative groups including those representing older people, working age groups, farming groups, trade unions, employer groups, accountancy bodies etc.  It was also forwarded to all members of the Oireachtas. </p><p>  Presentations on the introduction of these changes were also made at the Department&rsquo;s regular briefings with customer representative groups and to members of the public over the course of the year.  A further information campaign is planned to take place shortly to continue to raise awareness of the changes.</p></reply>

Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The person must be available for suitable full time employment. In determining whether the person is available for suitable full time employment, the following factors are taken into account: the person's skills, qualifications and experience; the length of time that the person has been unemployed; and the availability of job vacancies in the locality.  While failure to apply for a particular job for which a person is qualified could constitute a breach of the requirement to genuinely seek work, this would be determined having regard to the circumstances of a particular case and it cannot be stated that such a finding would automatically apply in respect of the scenario outlined.</p></reply>

This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money while also ensuring that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation.

Details of illness benefit claims registered, allowed and disallowed for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 (to 30/4/13) follow.</p><p>Illness Benefit Claim data for years 2011, 2012, 2013 (up to 30/04/2013)</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Claims Registered</div></th><th><div>Claims Allowed</div></th><th><div>Claims Disallowed</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>296,730</div></td><td><div>259,008</div></td><td><div>33,934</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>286,534</div></td><td><div>245,319</div></td><td><div>36,855</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013 (To 30/04/2013)</div></td><td><div>108,343</div></td><td><div>93,174</div></td><td><div>13,379</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Note on Table</b>   - It should be noted that the number of claims registered in a year will not equal the number of claims allowed + disallowed in the same year as a number of claims will cross annual boundaries and also a number of claims may be withdrawn.</p><p>In relation to distinguishing between physical and mental health incapacities, this is statistically difficult. Illness benefit claims on the Department&rsquo;s ISTS IT system hold a single &ldquo;certified cause of incapacity&rdquo; as reported by the customer&rsquo;s general practitioner. This is the primary condition which is initially diagnosed by the primary health care provider. However, a significant number of patients may have associated co-morbidities where whilst the certified cause of incapacity may well be the primary condition, it is the associated co-morbid conditions put together that render the person incapable of work. For example, patients with chronic physical disabilities associated with pain and physical ailments, may well go on to develop mental health conditions of anxiety and depression, and while they may well be physically able for a degree of functioning capacity, their mental health condition may now be the incapacitating factor. As a result it is not possible to prepare statistics which distinguish between mental health and physical conditions as the two can be and are interlinked.</p></reply>

The benefit is paid weekly, in arrears, on receipt of required medical certification signed by the customer&rsquo;s general practitioner.

Their assessments conform to the ethical conduct and behaviour guidelines of the Irish Medical Council. </p><p>  They are required to be medical practitioners who are on the general register of medical practitioners while holding an appointment.

They also have special training in eligibility assessment. </p><p>  There are currently twenty two Medical Assessors, including the Chief Medical Advisor and Deputy Chief Medical Advisor, who conduct medical assessments across a wide range of the Department's schemes including Illness Benefit.  Of these, six have post-graduate qualifications in the area of mental health, such as MRCPscyh and Dip Clinical Psychiatry.  They also have extensive clinical training and experience in psychiatry together with membership of recognised professional bodies such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists London and the College of Psychiatry Ireland.</p><p>  The Medical Assessors have an on-going commitment to continuing medical education to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced.  The Medical Assessors also work in a collegiate way to ensure that best practice and professional expertise is shared and applied across all of the cases that are reviewed by them.  This includes daily case conference meetings and a medical research unit has been established to actively engage in the update of the body of medical knowledge and evidence based practice.  As a result of a recent recruitment campaign for Medical Assessors, seven were recruited of which two have mental health qualifications - MRCPsych.  Further recruitment of Medical Assessors is underway.</p></reply>

The EU target population is defined by the combination of three indicators: at-risk-of-poverty, severe material deprivation and jobless households.  As part of this process member states set national poverty targets, using appropriate national indicators, in support of the EU target. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduce by a minimum of 200,000 (4.4 per cent) the combined population in consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or in basic deprivation, from the 2010 baseline of 31 per cent. Progress towards reaching the national target is set out in the national reform programme 2013 update within the broader context of reaching the national social target for poverty reduction to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3 per cent.  This progress is then reviewed annually as part of the EU&rsquo;s semester process.</p><p>  According to the 2011 results from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, published by the Central Statistics Office, 6.9 per cent of the population are in consistent poverty, which in the words of the CSO &lsquo;is not a statistically significant change on the 2010 figure of 6.3 per cent&rsquo;.  Nonetheless, meeting the national social target and by extension the Europe 2020 targets will of course be a challenge over the remaining years of the decade.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the most vulnerable are enabled to benefit from economic recovery through activation programmes and services. Targeting policies and resources at the groups which carry the greatest burden of poverty, notably jobless households and children, will continue to be a policy priority as is reflected in the commitment to set sub-targets for these groups. </p></reply>

The pension scheme would generally be established under Trust. The trustees of such scheme have duties under trust law to carry out the trust in accordance with the law and terms of the trust deed and rules and at all times to act in the best interests of scheme members.  In addition, the trustees are required to comply with their duties as set out in Part VI of the Pensions Act. These duties include a requirement to satisfy the Funding Standard as set out in the Pensions Act. Examples of this type of change may be from a defined benefit model to a defined contribution scheme or perhaps a form of hybrid scheme.  Section 59E of the Pensions Act outlines, in relation to the bulk transfer of money or resources for a group of members, the responsibilities of trustees in relation to the provision of information and communication.  It is generally expected that any change to pension provision would be carried out in consultation with the trustees of a scheme and representatives of scheme members and have regard to any employment contract that might exist for employees of the sponsoring employer.  Any concerns that the scheme may be contravening the Pensions Act should be raised with the Pensions Board.  </p></reply>

Through the rollout of Intreo offices nationwide, the aim is to engage with every unemployed individual to make sure that their first day out of work is also their first step on the pathway back to work. </p><p>  Activation is defined as the engagement with customers of the Department of Social Protection, of working age, who are in receipt of specified social welfare payments/ benefits in order to support them and their families in progressing into employment and / or other appropriate progression. Such engagement shall be on the basis of the articulation of the supports to be offered to the customer to assist him / her to return to the workforce or otherwise progress.  In accepting payment of benefit, assistance and / or support, the customer shall agree to avail him or herself of the appropriate support measures offered during the course of the activation process, including employment, education, training and / or placement in employment schemes.</p><p>  Under the new Intreo approach, the process of engagement starts immediately when a client registers for a Jobseeker's Allowance payment, and is informed by a personal profile captured in respect of each individual.  In the past no such profiles were captured and clients had to wait at least three months before being invited to a Group Engagement under the National Action Plan (NAP process).  </p><p>  As part of the registration process the client completes a profile questionnaire to enable the case worker assess the client&rsquo;s Probability of Exit (PEX) from unemployment. Depending on the outcome of this assessment the elements of further engagement with the client will vary. While all clients are referred for a group engagement session, the content of the session varies depending on the client's PEX score.  Clients with a low to mid-point PEX rating participate in Group Engagement sessions where they are provided with guidance on how to improve their job search activities and also on the training and development opportunities available to them to improve their employment prospects.  Clients with a high-PEX are invited to a Group Engagement Session tailored to their needs, including a networking component, where they are encouraged and helped to search for and secure employment.   </p><p>  Following the group engagement, clients with a low PEX rating are immediately referred for a one-to-one session with an Employment Services Officer, where they agree a personal progression plan.  These clients receive intensive one-to-one support from an experienced employment services advisor and may be directed to particular work experience and training programmes.  Clients with high PEX scores also receive one to one guidance if they remain on the live register.</p><p>  The first twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert 40 offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices. Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year.  Where the Intreo model has yet to be rolled out, the existing National Employment Action Plan (NEAP)  process continues, whereby referral to employment services takes place after 3 months on the live register.</p><p>  Taking both the Intreo offices and those still operating the older NEAP approach together, there were just over 41,100 initial referrals either to group engagement or one-to-one interviews in the period January-April of this year. Some 28,900 people attended these appointments; of those who did not attend, almost 4,000 had already closed their job-seekers&rsquo; claims by the date of their appointment. Over the same period, almost 9,300 people who had failed to attend an initial appointment were re-referred for interview or group engagement. Some 5,700 attended on re-referral, and 1,100 of those who failed to do so had already closed their job-seekers&rsquo; claims by the date of their appointment.</p><p>  Reduced payment rates (penalty rates) for jobseekers were introduced in April 2011 as a means of achieving the engagement of jobseekers with activation measures. A penalty of up to &euro;44 per week applies to an individual&rsquo;s jobseeker payment where there is a failure to engage with this process.</p><p>  The total number of penalty rates applied up to the end of 2012 was just over 1,800. A further 800 penalty rates were applied in the period from the beginning of January up to the end of April 2013.  </p></reply>

Jobseeker's benefit is based on a person's social insurance record and jobseeker's allowance is based on weekly means. A fundamental qualifying condition for a jobseeker's payment is that a person must be available for full-time work.</p><p>  Under EU Regulations, in certain circumstances a person on jobseeker's benefit may retain payment for a period of up to 13 weeks, while seeking work in another EU Member State. However, it is not possible to transfer jobseeker's allowance in the same way.  Jobseeker's allowance is listed by EU Regulation 883/2004 as a special non-contributory cash benefit and, as a result, it is paid &#8220;exclusively in the Member State in which the persons concerned reside, in accordance with its legislation&#8221;.  A jobseeker's allowance customer, to retain his or her payment, is therefore required to remain in the State.  </p><p>  Locally, however, arrangements may be made between a local office and a person on jobseeker's allowance, permitting the person to travel abroad for a job interview or a short holiday.  There are no plans to introduce a scheme of assistance for persons leaving the country. </p></reply>

It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these challenges.  To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.  These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. </p><p>  The Group's terms of reference provide for a range of issues to be considered including: child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes, the interaction of the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and the Budget 2012 proposals concerning disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance.  The Group's overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference.  The Group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports and its report on this first module of work was published on 20 February 2013.</p><p>  The Advisory Group's second report was on the issue of the Budget 2012 proposals relating to Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance.  This report was published on 11 April 2013.  The Advisory Group's third module of work related to the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Group's report on this issue was submitted to the Minister for Social Protection in May 2013 and its implications are currently being considered by the Minister and her Department.  The Group is currently progressing its fourth module of work on the issue of working age income supports and the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems, with a view to concluding this module as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

These reforms will create a transitional arrangement specifically for former OFP recipients with children under 14 years of age who are awarded a JA payment.  This arrangement will operate for a transitional period and give these individuals an exemption from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  This transitional period is required as lone parents with young children have caring responsibilities which may have prevented them from being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  This arrangement will enable lone parents to work part time, provided they satisfy the JA means test, and will therefore offer them the continued security of income support from my Department.  Lone parents on JA under this arrangement will also be able to access the new afterschool child care scheme, which provides subsidised afterschool childcare if they secure employment or engage on a CE scheme. </p><p>  The aim of introducing these OFP reforms and for creating this arrangement is to improve outcomes for lone parents.  As a result of these measures lone parents will now be able to access the Department's activation supports and services.  As part of this process, all lone parents on JA will be profiled, have a group engagement, and be encouraged to develop a personal development plan in conjunction with their case officer.  This personal development plan will identify suitable education, training, and employment programmes that will enable them to improve their skills set and increase their prospects of securing employment.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until the lone parent's youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should the customer continue to claim the JA payment, he/she will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.</p></reply>

It is delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to set up a National Employment and Entitlements Service and involves a multi-annual programme of complex legislative, organisation, process, people, and work change running to the end of 2014.  There are five strands to the Pathways approach relating to:</p><p>- Engagement with people who are unemployed;</p><p>- The provision of  activation places and opportunities;</p><p>- Incentivising the take-up of opportunities;</p><p>- Working with  employers; and </p><p>- Reforming institutions </p><p>  We have made good progress on all strands.  The Deputy will be aware of the institutional changes arising from the merger of the Community Welfare Service and F&Aacute;S employment services with my Department - both of which were transferred on time and within budget at the start of last year.  Progress has been made on working with employers with the establishment of an Employer Engagement Unit within my Department.  With regard to activation places and opportunities 2012 saw the very successful roll-out of JobBridge and T&Uacute;S while Budget 2013 provided for an additional 13,000 places on various employment schemes representing a 30% increase on existing provision.  Jobseekers have a stronger incentive to take up these and other employment opportunities by virtue of changes to referral processes, payment arrangements in respect of casual work and the introduction of penalty rates of payment  for non-engagement with activation initiatives.</p><p>  The impact of the Pathways approach is most evident in the more frequent and more intensive manner of our engagement with jobseekers.  For example 68,600 clients participated in a group engagement process last year, while over 40,000 clients have benefitted from such engagements already this year.  Similarly the Department conducted 158,000 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers last year.  The target is to complete 185,000 initial interviews in 2013.  Significantly under the Intreo model being rolled out across the country, the process of engagement starts immediately when a client registers for a Jobseekers payment and is informed by a personal profile captured in respect of each individual.  In the past no such profiles were captured and clients had to wait at least three months before being invited to a Group Engagement.  In addition decision times in respect of jobseeker claims are significantly reduced from an average of four weeks under the old method of operation to under a week, and in most cases to no more than 2/3 days, in Intreo offices.</p><p>  The 12 twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert 40 offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices.  Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year. </p><p>  With respect to plans for 2013 I have published a comprehensive set of performance targets, set out on a on a quarter by quarter basis, on the Department's website  and will publish performance against these targets starting in July of this year.</p></reply>

An overpayment was assessed against the person concerned for the period 12th March 2009 to 26th May 2010.  The Department wrote to the person concerned notifying them of this overpayment and affording them the right to appeal the decision.  The person in question appealed this decision in writing and their letter was sent to the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 6th of December 2010.  However, it appears that this correspondence went astray and the Social Welfare Appeals Office has confirmed that they did not receive this appeal request. </p><p>  I can confirm that, in the particular circumstances of this case, an appeal has now been accepted by the Social Welfare Appeals Office and they have undertaken to expedite the matter as far as possible.

The Recommendation is that Member States should: "Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education."</p><p>  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will be more gradual in the Member States experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment. The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee.</p><p>  With regard to job creation for youth in support of the guarantee, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. The government&rsquo;s job-creation policies are outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, which sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. Under the updated Action Plan for 2013, a new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment. This incentive will be launched for availability by July 2013.</p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided.</p><p>  The size and the timescale for any additional provision, over and above that outlined above that is both desirable and feasible will be established over the coming months.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  The Government is implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:-</p><p>- The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;</p><p>- The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;</p><p>- The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;</p><p>- Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses;</p><p>- This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;</p><p>- The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700. The recent interim independent evaluation of the Scheme conducted by Indecon Independent Economic Consultants found that 61% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements. This high level of progression suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention which has achieved very significant progress in a short period of time.</p><p>- Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register;</p><p>- In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people.</p><p>  With regard to targets, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  Specifically, these targets are that:</p><p>(i) at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.</p><p>(ii) Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015</p><p>(iii) Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed)  to 25%.</p><p>  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people.  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.</p><p>  Following from the formal adoption of the EU Recommendation on Implementing a Youth Guarantee, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is welcome that the official labour market figures published by the CSO indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.

The purpose of this Fund, which is administered by the local authorities, is to assist with urgent works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and in certain cases, works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas. This Fund is not intended to assist in the carrying out of routine maintenance, alterations or improvements, demolition, reconstruction or restoration.

All archaeological excavation in the State is carried out under the terms of a Licence issued by myself as Minister, and those terms confer on the licensed archaeologist a responsibility to care for any artefacts discovered during the excavation until these are deposited with the National Museum of Ireland, or by agreement, with a Designated Local Museum. That responsibility of care includes the requirement to provide for the proper conservation, documentation and packing of the artefacts and because of the complexity of modern archaeological excavation, there can often be a considerable lapse of time between the completion of the on-site phase of excavation works and the final deposition of artefacts.</p><p>  The Museum operates a dedicated store for artefacts from archaeological excavations in its new Collections Resource Centre.  I am further advised by the National Museum that a relatively small number of archaeological companies have ceased trading and in most of these cases the archaeologists involved have continued to work with the National Museum in preparing material for deposition, even after the company had technically ceased trading. As a result, a considerable amount of the artefacts held by these companies has already been deposited in the Museum and most of the remainder is being actively prepared for deposition.</p><p>  The National Museum continues to maintain active communication with all archaeological companies (including the personnel of companies that have ceased trading) to ensure that everything possible is being done to prepare artefacts for deposition in the Museum, and to ensure that the artefacts are being properly cared for in the meantime.</p></reply>

The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.</p><p>  My Department has now engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the national plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council.</p><p>  In collaboration with the Peatlands Council and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is also working with local communities to arrange for relocation to nearby bogs of those who wish to continue turf-cutting. Arrangements have been made for the relocation of turf-cutters from Clara Bog in County Offaly, who have now commenced turf-cutting on their relocation bog, and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway who will be cutting in their bog next year.</p><p>  In the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, the Department has identified potential relocation sites for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation.  The provision of financial payments or deliveries of turf is available to those awaiting relocation and to those awaiting the finalisation of the National Plan.</p><p>  Relocation is a complex process requiring the investigation of suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, assessment of infrastructure/drainage works required, establishment of the number of turf-cutters who can be accommodated on the site, assessment of the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and in certain cases securing required planning and environmental consents. Accordingly, it will take a number of years to bring this process to a conclusion in respect of all the relocation sites.</p><p>  If it becomes apparent, following detailed analysis, that no relocation possibilities exist for a particular SAC, then a case can be made to the EU Commission for a more flexible approach, as provided for in the Habitats Directive. I hope that the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season.</p><p>  The <i>Turbary Rights Transfer Programme for Irish Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation </i>was submitted by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association (TCCA) to me and to the European Commission in March 2012, some weeks after the passing of the Private Member's Motion. This document represents an honest and genuine attempt to find an acceptable resolution to this difficult issue. In fact, many of the suggestions made in this document, and in previous documents submitted by the TCCA and by other groups were subsequently incorporated into my own document, the <i>National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan - Proposed Approach</i>  , which was published in September last.</p><p>  However, there is one crucial element contained in the TCCA proposal that is clearly not within the terms of the Habitats Directive. The proposed continuation of turf-cutting on many of the SACs for several years while a national plan is put in place is clearly at variance with EU law, and in particular Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. The European Commission and the Government have concluded that we simply do not have the legal discretion to follow that path. In face of our current infringement proceedings, to do so would be to invite certain litigation against the State, including potential injunctive action and substantial fines.</p><p>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog SACs are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law. The door is still open for the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf-cutters and other interested parties. Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf-cutters more speedily.</p></reply>

I was also guest at a pre-Conference dinner hosted by the Prime Minister of Malta on 20 May.  The theme of this sixth annual European Maritime Day Conference was Coastal Development and Sustainable Maritime Tourism.</p><p>  The European Maritime Day 2013 Conference was organised by the European Commission in partnership with the Maltese Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business, and the Maltese Ministry for Tourism. Approximately 850 participants participated in one or more of the 27 sessions of the Conference, among them a number of Irish participants.</p><p>  I addressed the opening session of the Conference and detailed Irish Presidency priorities in the area of Blue Growth, including the adoption of an Action Plan for the Atlantic Area Strategy. I outlined the measures we are taking in Ireland to harness the potential of coastal and maritime tourism, as part of an overall integrated approach to the management of our marine assets as set out in the Government's Integrated Marine Plan: <i>Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth</i> launched by the Government in 2012, aims to double the value of Ireland's ocean wealth to 2.4% of GDP by 2030 and increase the turnover from our ocean economy to exceed &euro;6.4bn by 2020. The Integrated Marine Plan provides momentum for growth in the marine area and seeks to ensure that government ministries work together more efficiently and effectively on the diverse issues related to the marine.  Work to implement the Plan is being overseen by the Inter-Departmental Marine Coordination Group, chaired by the Minister for the Marine, Simon Coveney.</p><p>  As is customary for the Presidency in the first half of the year, the Irish Presidency also convened a Senior Officials Meeting and lunch en marge of the Conference, with the theme of delivering the objective of maritime growth and jobs.</p></reply>

The Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, chaired by An Taoiseach, oversees delivery of the various actions contained in the policy statement.  In relation to Energy Efficiency a number of actions enhancing the public, private and household sectors are identified in the report for implementation by my Department and include the following:</p><p>Publish a second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan</p><p>  I published the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in February which reaffirms Ireland's commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 in pursuit of our EU obligations.  This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO<sub>2 </sub>  emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland and will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target.</p><p>Introduce an Energy Framework for the Public Service which will further improve the level of energy consumption by the sector.</p><p>  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body's progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement Service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector consumption will be published later this year.  This report will set out progress towards achieving the 33% public sector reduction target.  Work on the National Energy Services Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing investment-ready projects, is well advanced and the first draft of the Framework will be published shortly.  The Framework will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund, to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital. </p><p>Continue to support energy efficiency improvements in homes through the Better Energy scheme up to the end of 2013.</p><p>  The SEAI administers the Better Energy Programme that consistently delivers energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  Since the start of the programme over &euro;250 million in Exchequer funding has been disbursed.  The Government has committed to spending &euro;44.519 million on the Better Energy Homes Programme during 2013 allowing substantial economic activity supporting jobs and generating anticipated energy savings of 418GWh (99.6 kt CO2) at a time of severe budgetary constraint.   </p><p>Introduce a Pay As You Save (PAYS) scheme to replace the Better Energy Homes scheme from 2014, and a strand of the PAYS scheme to improve energy efficiency in the public and commercial sectors in 2013.</p><p>  The NEEAP and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to households and commercial operators.  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key State and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will continue to be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken in quarter three of this year.</p><p>Continue to provide supports to business to improve their energy and resource efficiency and manage their costs through the SEAI, EPA and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  The Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) and the Energy Agreements Programme is a well-established networking and information programme for large industrial energy users.  Now in operation for over 16 years, it engages 160 of the largest energy users in ongoing relationships, including site visits, workshops and annual performance reporting.  Energy spend across the LIEN is approximately &euro;800 million and accounts for approximately 60% of all industrial energy usage.</p><p>  The Energy Agreements Programme supports large industry to implement an energy-management system through the EN 16001 standard. Consistent annual saving across the Network averages between 2% and 3% accounting for annual energy saving of &euro;16 million and above.</p><p>  Competitiveness is high on the Government's and the business community's agendas and SEAI's focus continues to be on promoting energy efficiency and associated cost reduction programmes throughout small and large business sectors.  Over 200 SMEs participated in a wide range of activities including energy assessments, small business training, EnergyMap training and a number of networking events. 140 registrations to the Advice Mentoring and Assessments (AMA) programme in 2012 were recorded and the projected savings were 42 GWh.  Annual savings of over 10% are being generated by the participating businesses year on year.</p></reply>

Warmer Homes provides a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and through an area based programme.  The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are provided free of charge to the customer.</p><p>  The SEAI has confirmed to my Department that it received the application in question on 25 March 2013.  The SEAI is currently arranging surveys for clients who have applications submitted between January and April 2013.  The relevant application is therefore with their surveying team who will make contact with the applicant to confirm eligibility and complete a survey.  The eligibility criteria are clearly outlined on the SEAI website and include the following:</p><p>- Owner occupied non-Local Authority homes</p><p>- Constructed before 2002</p><p>- The owner is in receipt of one of the following: Fuel Allowance as part of the National Fuel Scheme; Job Seekers Allowance for over six months and with children under 7 years of age; or Family Income support.</p><p>  I understand that the applicant is in receipt of grant-aid under the Farm Assist scheme.  This however, is not one of the qualifying criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme.  The Deputy should note therefore that the applicant will need to confirm that he meets one of the eligibility criteria set out above, in order to be eligible for service delivery of energy efficiency measures under this scheme.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with &#8220;3&#8221;, the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3 Mbps and 1.4 Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6 Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &#8220;3&#8221;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.  Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact &#8220;3&#8221;'s customer care centre, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to  or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2.  I note that the customer in question had contacted the customer care centre, but was not satisfied with the response received.</p><p>  My Department has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at   , with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.  My Department will then liaise with &#8220;3&#8221; personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy any service performance issues.</p><p>  In this instance, my officials had, directly upon receipt of the correspondence from the person referred to in the Question contacted this NBS customer on Thursday, 9<sup>th</sup> May last.  The details of the complaint were forwarded to &#8220;3&#8221; who arranged for an engineer to visit the premises. &#8220;3&#8221; have confirmed that, following the visit by the engineer, the NBS service provided is now within the contracted specification and that a rebate for three months, in relation to the time taken to resolve the complaint, has been applied to their account.</p><p>  The NBS customer in question has informed my officials that they are satisfied to close the complaint.  The customer has been advised to contact my officials directly should they experience any further difficulties.</p></reply>

Under Phase I of this Programme, 28 MANs were completed and 60 MANs, covering 66 towns, were constructed under Phase II.  The MANs which are regionally dispersed enhance the attractiveness of the locations for indigenous and foreign investment.  A list of the MANs and their respective locations follows.</p><p>  The MANs are managed, operated, maintained and marketed by e|net, on behalf of the State.  There has been significant improvement over the last few years in the take-up by service providers of the MANs.  Of the 88 MANs, 81 are currently &quot;lit&quot;, that is, connected to backhaul and in use by one or more telecoms service providers.  It is estimated that in excess of 600,000 individuals and business users are benefitting from the MANs infrastructure.</p><p>  Since the inception of the MANs Programme, demand for bandwidth has increased significantly and this increase is expected to continue.  Almost all broadband service providers, (including DSL, mobile, cable, wireless), are increasingly turning to optical fibre to backbone their networks.  Service providers will continue to bring optical fibre closer to their end users.  The MANs are ready to meet the demand for fibre connectivity and to serve the needs of service providers and their end users for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Phase

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kildare, can be found on ComReg's website at .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has recently appointed experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County KIldare, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p></reply>

The scheme, which is overseen by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department and was due to run for a trial period of three years, was extended in the Finance Act 2011 for a further 3 years to end 2014. </p><p>  The ACA offers an incentive whereby it allows companies to write off 100% of the purchase value of qualifying energy efficient equipment against their profit in the year of purchase rather than over the normal eight year depreciation period. By encouraging companies to purchase energy efficient equipment, the ACA aims to improve the overall energy efficiency of Irish companies Additionally it benefits companies, especially Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), by reducing tax liabilities, increasing cash flows and reducing future energy costs.</p><p>  SEAI continuously review the eligible technology categories and criteria with a view to amending the Triple E (Energy Efficient Equipment)/ACA list of qualifying products as appropriate.  Currently the ACA, which has been incorporated into the wider Triple E register, covers 10 different equipment categories and 52 associated technologies, and only energy efficient equipment that meets the relevant eligibility criteria are listed.  Twice a year (April and November) Statutory Instruments (S.I.) are published with the latest updates of eligibility criteria and eligible products.  With the publication of the latest Order (SI 123 of 2013), there are now over 10,000 products on the ACA list. </p><p>  Regarding the specific product, namely radiant heaters, the advice to me from the SEAI is that the dedicated testing standard for radiant panels (EN 14037) describes a procedure for measuring the rated thermal output and the mean surface temperature of the panel but does not describe a procedure for testing the radiant efficiency of the panel.  In the absence of such a standardised test procedure for this critical parameter it is not possible to objectively define efficiency criteria for their inclusion in the Triple E/ACA database.  Further information on the ACA scheme, including the list of ACA categories, eligibility criteria and product register, can be found on SEAI's website - .</p></reply>

These banks are approximately 10kms from the Dublin and Wicklow coasts.  The company recently published an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in respect of the proposal, which is known as Dublin Array. A public consultation process is currently on-going. However, pending publication of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, this application will not be assessed by my Department or the Marine Licence Vetting Committee.</p><p>  In order to construct a windfarm on the foreshore, consents from the Commission for Energy Regulation are also required, including a Licence to Generate Electricity and an Authorisation to Construct a Generating Station. Planning permission in respect of any land-based infrastructure associated with the development is also necessary.  Foreshore lease terms for offshore wind projects address such matters as environmental standards, construction methodology, good management of the facility, fees payable as well as standard legal clauses regarding issues such as warranties, insurance and indemnities. </p><p>  Issues such as noise and visual impact in respect of any specific proposed development are investigated in an applicant&rsquo;s EIS and where applicable, Natura Impact Statement, which are made publicly available.  My Department&rsquo;s assessment of those aspects of a development will have regard to the information contained in the EIS, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, the associated Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment as well as the best available advice from planning and environmental impact advisors.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. </p><p>  In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p><p>  The housing policy statement identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs) as key partners in the delivery of social housing.  This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector. </p><p>  The move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for AHBs and will take some time to be fully agreed and implemented.  As such, I intend to develop a regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. </p><p>  This framework is being developed in consultation with the sector and it will:</p><p>- assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit;</p><p>- provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies' competences; and</p><p>- place sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a coordinated approach to the development of the sector.</p><p>  An important step in this regard will be the publication in the coming weeks of a voluntary code for the regulation of AHBs. This code will be a first step towards a statutory regulatory framework that will protect the very significant State investment in the sector over the last two decades and will provide assistance to those working in the sector to meet the challenges ahead.  It will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop this longer-term statutory framework to best support the enhanced role of AHBs. </p></reply>

Since then my Department has been working with the liquidators and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the winding up process was conducted in an efficient and effective way. </p><p>  In 2012 a new system was put in place whereby the Local Development Companies (LDCs) situated in the geographically contiguous areas were contracted to deliver RDP funds to the Gaeltacht areas.  The liquidation of MFG inevitably caused delays in project payments and approvals. However, the system which my Department put in place is now operational for a number of months and the contracted LDCs continue to facilitate the project payment process for projects in Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>  The new companies were required to review the MFG &lsquo;legacy projects&rsquo; which they received to ensure compliance with the European Regulation and Programme rules, and this has taken some time. The revised arrangements for the Erris area will be finalised over the coming weeks with the Mayo North East Leader Partnership and my Department.  The rebalancing of the RDP is now complete and individual Local Development Companies were notified of their final allocations under the Programme on 20 May 2013 . I have ring - fenced &euro;6 million for the former MFG areas and for new projects in these areas. At all times, my Department has directed the LDCs to pay promptly all MFG contractual commitments properly due and has funded the companies in this regard. </p></reply>

These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits. The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year.</p><p>  The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government , to ensure effective control and management of public finances.  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.</p><p>  The <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First</i>, sets out Government decisions for a range of local government reform measures including the decision to replace town councils with a new comprehensive model of municipal governance to strengthen local government within counties and address weaknesses and anomalies in the current system.  While the Action Programme will have no impact on the requirements I have set out for the management of the GGB, I would expect that cost savings will arise from sub-county restructuring through operational integration and elimination of duplication.  It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.</p></reply>

The legislative basis for the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge, as set out in the amended 2009 Act, has not altered from 2012 to 2013.  A person in receipt of rental income is assessed for income tax on the basis of allowable expenses incurred in earning those rents. What constitutes an allowable expense is set out in the Tax Acts. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the Charge is not on the list of allowable items in those Acts and therefore it is not an allowable expense in computing taxable rental income.

Following a review of submissions received under this process, I gave effect to new consolidating solid fuel regulations, the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 326 of 2012).  These Regulations introduced a number of improved and updated provisions to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.</p><p>  The Regulations extended the smoky coal ban to seven new towns with effect from 1 May 2013. The ban now applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  Greystones is among the towns added to the ban and the Greystones ban area includes the adjoining village of Delgany. Maps of all smoky coal ban areas are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Atmosphere/AirQuality/SmokyCoalBan/.</p><p>  Air quality monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply. However, smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective, with residents living inside smaller ban areas more easily able to source smoky coal being sold outside the ban area. As such, the further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the best approach.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the regulatory improvements brought about by the new Regulations, I recognise that having different standards applying to coal between larger urban and smaller urban/rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for people across these different locations. While I have set the challenging target of introducing a ban on smoky coal across the State within the next three years, I fully recognise the cross-border enforcement difficulties arising, if a national ban is introduced unilaterally in the South rather than on an all-island basis.</p><p>  With this in mind, I announced on 6 May that a joint North-South study is being commissioned, in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, to examine emissions from residential heating, and in particular, air pollution from residential smoky coal in both jurisdictions and the potential policy options to reduce such emissions.  A more effective alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis would support the introduction of a nationwide smoky coal ban. In addition to the clean air benefits, a nationwide ban would facilitate more effective enforcement, promote broader regulatory compliance and help to eliminate black market activities.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector. Real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates and the Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort.</p><p>  As part of this process a Legislative Review Group has been established. Its remit is to review legislation, including the Derelict Sites Act 1990, with a view to assessing the various legislative provisions governing this area, and to make recommendations for strengthening or amending provisions to take account of the issues associated with unfinished developments, where necessary. In regard to the Derelict Sites Act 1990 the Group concluded that the legislation continues to serve its intended purpose.</p></reply>

One of the main statutory functions of the PSRA is the licensing of property service providers, i.e. auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents. The Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.</p><p>  The 2011 Act provides for the licensing of all persons engaged in the provision of property services. Applicants for a Property Services Provider's licence must meet certain minimum qualification requirements before a licence can be granted, namely minimum academic qualification or appropriate experience.</p><p>  Under the minimum academic qualification requirement a person must have obtained 120 ECTS credits in a range of specified subjects. The appropriate experience requirement means that a person must be able to demonstrate to the Authority that they have been lawfully engaged in the provision of the property service, for which they have been seeking a licence, for three of the five years immediately preceding the making of their application. The Authority also has the discretion to consider both academic qualifications and experience together as qualifying a person where the applicant does not individually meet the specific academic and experience requirements. Full details of the qualifications requirements are set out in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 (Qualifications) Requirements 2012 (S.I. No. 181 of 2012), made by the PSRA. The Regulations provide that a licence applicant should have 120 ECTS in specific subjects to be academically qualified, or provide appropriate evidence of experience in the provision of the property service for which the licence is sought.</p><p>  I have no plans at this time to amend the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.</p></reply>

Section 2(3) of the Censorship of Films Act 1923 as amended provides that whenever the Director of Film Classification is temporarily unable to attend to his duties, or where the office of Director of Film Classification is vacant, the Minister may appoint a fit person to perform the duties of the Director of Film Classification, during such inability or vacancy. Every person so appointed shall during his appointment have all the powers of the Director of Film Classification. In accordance with Section 2(3) of the Act, Mr Ger Connolly, the Deputy Director of Film Classification has been appointed to perform the duties of the Director of Film Classification, on a full time basis, since the retirement of Mr John Kelleher from the position of Director of Film Classification in late 2009.

Online streaming of films as with most internet content does not fall within the scope of current legislation. The regulation of such online content is complicated by the fact that streamed content may often be provided from servers which are not located in the jurisdiction and therefore are not subject to Irish legislation. However, it might be noted that most copyright holders of film/DVD works submit their product, regardless of mode of delivery, to the Irish Film Classification Office for age classification. Once classified, the age rating and consumer advice for such releases are available on the IFCO website, www.ifco.ie. This is an important tool, particularly for parents/guardians, in assessing the suitability of viewing material.</p><p>  I have no specific plans for legislative change in this area. The Deputy will be aware that the internet is global in reach and that, as a consequence, there is very limited scope for regulation by national authorities.</p></reply>

Specialist assistance is provided by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI) where required and I have been assured by the Commissioner that sufficient resources are allocated to the GBFI.   In addition, the Criminal Assets Bureau has also been active in targeting the proceeds of deception, fraud, money laundering, bribery and corruption and other types of criminal activity commonly referred to as &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo;.</p><p>  The conviction rate for any given category of offence relates in the first instance to the outcome of the criminal prosecution process and the Deputy will appreciate that my role does not extend to the bringing of prosecutions, or indeed to the determination of guilt, which is a matter for the courts.   In relation to the trends which may be observed from the official crime figures published by the Central Statistics Office, as I have previously observed in responding to the Deputy, it is important to note in interpreting figures for detection and conviction rates that the investigation, detection and prosecution of any offence may take a number of years and the circumstances and complexity of any given case may vary considerably.  Great caution should therefore be exercised in comparing, as the Deputy appears to do, conviction rates for offences recorded in 2003 and those recorded up to 2011, which is the latest year for which the CSO have published such detailed data.</p><p>  However, I am of course concerned to ensure that the investigation and detection of fraud and white collar offences is as effective as it can be and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has available to it the necessary legislative and other supports to this end.  I continue to attach the highest priority to the full investigation of these offences and bringing the perpetrators of such crimes to justice. Shortly after taking up office I moved urgently to introduce additional legislation in this area which was enacted as the Criminal Justice Act 2011, and provides vital assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the completion of current white collar crime investigations as well as providing assistance to them in future investigations. The Garda Commissioner is aware that any further legislative proposals he might have which would assist in the investigation and detection of white collar crime, or of fraud offences generally, will be positively considered by me.</p><p>  I am briefed on an ongoing basis by the Garda Commissioner on the progress of the major white collar crime investigations which are underway and remain fully confident that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to confront crime in all of its manifestations.</p></reply>

The main area of complaint with regards to investments is the alleged mis-selling of these policies. This complaint type accounted for over 37% of investment complaints for the period 2007-2010. The majority of complaints relate to the consumers' contention that they were sold unsuitable products.&quot;</p><p>  More recently, in its bi-annual review for July to December 2012, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has again highlighted the mis-selling of financial products in noting that, &quot;Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) complaints, representing 32% of all insurance complaints in 2012, have increased by 216% on 2011 figures&quot; (from 405 in 2011 to 1280 in 2012), and that, &quot;in general, the main feature of the complaints concern the suitability of PPI for the consumer and the consumer's knowledge or lack thereof that they agreed to and paid for the product in the first instance.&quot; I am also aware that the Central Bank has sought a review by banks of the sale of PPI and the refund of customers who could never claim under that insurance as purchased.</p><p>  While not under the aegis of my Department, the Financial Services Ombudsman was established under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 and became operational on 1 April 2005. It is a statutory body funded by levies from the financial service providers. The Financial Services Ombudsman can investigate, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with Financial Service Providers who are either regulated by the Financial Regulator or are subject to the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. </p><p>  Under current law, the Financial Services Ombudsman may not investigate a matter which occurred more than six years before the complaint is made. This is in line with the limitation period for most civil claims in the courts, including contract. This limitation period is provided for under section 57BX of the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended by section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004. The relevant provision states:</p><p>  &quot;(3) A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of--</p><p>  (<i>a</i> ) is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal, or</p><p>  (<i>b</i> ) occurred more than 6 years before the complaint is made, or</p><p>  (<i>c</i> ) relates to a matter that is within the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman, or</p><p>  (<i>d</i> ) is of a class prescribed by Council.&quot;</p><p>  I would also point out that the statutory functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council include the keeping under review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Office of the Ombudsman and advising &quot;the Minister for Finance, either at the Minister's request or at its own initiative, on any matter relevant to the Ombudsman's operation&quot;. It would seem, therefore, open to the Council to make any relevant recommendations concerning the current limitation period that it considers appropriate to the Minister for Finance - who will be best placed to consider the appropriateness of such a change in relation to overall Government policy as it applies to financial services. I am also aware that a different approach has been taken to this issue in the United Kingdom. While consumers in that jurisdiction must bring complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service within six months of the final response letter from the business concerned, no limitation period applies to the matters on which the complaints are based. </p><p>  The Law Reform Commission has made recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime in its Report on the Limitation of Actions of December 2011 and in relation to the limitation period applicable to contract law which could have a bearing on the matters raised. I will be happy to take account of these recommendations in any proposals for legislation that I may develop on periods of limitation in the future. In relation to directly addressing the issue of mis-selling raised by the Deputies, this will, in the first instance, have to take account of any relevant developments in core sectoral policy between the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, its Council, and the Minister for Finance. To date, I have not been made aware of any developments or proposals in this regard. However, I will take the opportunity to raise the Deputies' concerns with my colleague in Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, as regards the policy position of his Department in relation to a change in the limitation period applicable to the mis-selling of financial products.</p></reply>

Inter-partner violence against members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender communities is covered under the remit of Cosc and is mentioned specifically on its website under the heading <i><i>What is intimate partner violence?</i></i>which states:<i>&quot;IPV is experienced by all nationalities, education levels and ages and can occur in dating relationships, marriages or long term gay or lesbian relationships, often even after the relationship has ended&quot;.</i></p><p>  Earlier this year Cosc supported a Union of Students of Ireland (USI) nationwide study of students' experiences of harassment, stalking, violence and sexual assault. The study is based on the successful UK Union of Students <i>Hidden Marks</i> survey, and, inter alia, explores the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students of such violence. The research analysis is currently underway and publication of the full report is expected shortly.  However, general violence in the community does not fall under the remit of Cosc. Its prevention and investigation is primarily the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Victims Charter promises to manage cases involving members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender community with sensitivity and, where appropriate, to refer the individuals involved to a Gay Liaison Officer within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Equally, a person who is 18 or over cannot bring a claim of discrimination on the age ground  which is based on a comparison with a person aged less than 18. For example, an adult cannot seek children's fare on a bus.  I would emphasise, however, that the Acts do apply to discrimination against under 18s based on the other eight grounds. It is, therefore, possible for a young person to bring a claim of discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, membership of the Traveller community etc. Such complaints have in fact been dealt with by the Equality Tribunal. It is not correct to say that the Acts exclude young people.</p><p>  The Equal Status Act has been amended twice to make changes in the way it impacts on young people. The law was clarified in relation to the regulation of access to licensed premises by persons under 18 years of age and the conditions under which it is permissible to set an age limit for the purchase of liquor higher than 18 years. The Equal Status Act was also amended to apply it to discrimination on the age ground in the provision of motor vehicle insurance to drivers under 18 years of age.</p><p>  The reason for excluding under 18s from claiming discrimination on the age ground is that 18 is a standard cut-off for access to many services. For example, it is the age of majority, the age at which contractual commitments are fully enforceable, the age for sale of drink, etc.  It would be impractical to extend the age ground to under 18s as this would necessitate the provision of an extraordinary number of exemptions within the legislation and would entail a revisiting of virtually every area of the Equal Status Act. It would also mean that, in principle, it would no longer be permissible to give any preference (such as a reduced price) to young people.  There are clearly important issues of protection for children involved here.  A general application of the age ground to persons under 18 would not be practical or appropriate.</p></reply>

The Bill, which has completed Second Stage, is due to commence Committee Stage in July.</p><p>  From the outset, and as evident from the provisions of Part 2 of the Bill as published, it is permeated by the principle of lay representation and I will be developing this and other aspects of the Bill further in the course of Committee Stage. It has never been stated or intended that the Law Society or the Bar Council would select lay members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority - indeed, this would run contrary to the Bill's policy objective of more independent regulation of the legal professions and of legal costs.</p><p>  As I have previously indicated in my statement to the House at the closing of the Bill's Second Stage and on numerous occasions since, including more recently at the Law Society, I will be bringing forward amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill at Committee Stage to enhance and copper-fasten the independence of appointment of members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority - a majority of whom shall be lay persons. I will be proposing that this be done by means of nominating bodies among whom will be numerous bodies of relevance to the mandate of the new Regulatory Authority in addition to the legal professional bodies.  In a similar vein, I will be enhancing the modalities of appointment of members to the Complaints Committee and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. I also intend to bring forward an amendment to stagger the appointment of members of the Authority to ensure its continuity and minimise the scope for external interference by a wholesale reconfiguration. Taken together, these amendments will put to rest previously voiced concerns about the independence of the new regulatory regime. As I have previously stated, details of these amendments will be made available in advance of Committee Stage.</p></reply>

Declarations of alienage are accepted where evidence is provided of acquisition of another citizenship or in a case where another citizenship is already held, cessation of Irish citizenship is effected from date of a declaration.  The numbers of those who submitted such a Declaration for the years 2002 to 2012 are 37, 38, 25, 33, 17, 27, 14, 32, 24, 30 and 32 respectively.</p><p>  Section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended provides that the Minister may revoke a certificate of naturalisation in certain circumstances principally related to procurement of citizenship by fraud, if the person has lived permanently abroad for a period of 7 years (and not registered with an embassy or consular office abroad) or has acquired citizenship in another country except by way of marriage or entry into a civil partnership.  I can inform the Deputy that for the period involved there have been no cases where a Certificate of Naturalisation has been revoked by either myself or my predecessors.</p></reply>

The unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the GCVU and this must remain the case.  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently one Superintendent, two Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the GCVU.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who are undergoing the required training course.  A further nine personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13 May 2013 and an additional six will take up positions on 31 May 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the unit.</p></reply>

It is open to anyone to seek nomination to this office and all such requests for appointment are considered by me.  The Garda authorities may also request an appointment in the public interest when they believe there is an essential need for a further appointment.  There are 24 peace commissioners entered on the current roll of peace commissioners as residing in the Garda sub-district serving Tralee.  One application for appointment is under consideration at present.  It must be taken into account however that peace commissioner records are appointment based and every effort is made to maintain an accurate record of active peace commissioners.  The Department is reliant on peace commissioners individually and other interested parties to advise of changes which may occur subsequent to appointment.  Peace commissioner records are maintained by reference to the Garda administrative areas in which peace commissioners reside.</p></reply>

The e-gates offer certain categories of arriving passengers - passport holders from EU states including Ireland, EEA states and Switzerland who are over 18 years of age and hold a first generation biometric passport i.e. with an electronic chip which contains the holder's facial image - a self-service type channel to clear immigration control.  The purpose of the trial is to test the suitability of this technology for use at Dublin Airport with a view to providing a more secure and efficient means for clearing passengers through immigration control.  The results of the trial will be evaluated before a decision is taken on the future use of such technology in the border control process, including the hours of operation.</p><p>  For the trial period the gates will operate between the times of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. which has been agreed for the purposes of testing and evaluating the technology.  While the gates in question have only been in operation for a little over a month and for the restricted hours as outlined, the general feedback to date from the travelling public has been quite positive.</p></reply>

It should be noted that this figure is provisional, operational and liable to change.  All incidents where persons have been reported missing remain under investigation until such time as the person is located.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reviews missing persons cases on a regular basis.  The district officer (superintendent) in the area where a person has gone missing takes direct responsibility for all investigations and searches carried out.  Local investigation teams are appointed by the district officer, and all means necessary, including the services of specialist units, are deployed to assist in these investigations, as considered appropriate.  The services of Interpol and Europol can also be availed of during such investigations, if necessary.</p><p>  The Garda missing persons bureau, which is responsible for all data relating to missing persons, provides expert assistance and advice to district officers in all high risk missing person cases.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources, including staff and technology, are in place to deal with this issue and investigations are carried out in line with international best practice.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a joint protocol is in place with the Health Service Executive, HSE, providing a strategic and uniform approach to the issue of children who are reported  as missing from care, with the overall objective of reducing such incidents, preventing such children from suffering harm and returning them to safety as soon as possible.  I am advised that the investigation in relation to the case referred to the Deputy is ongoing and am assured that Garda liaison is being maintained with the family concerned.</p><p>  In so far as the funding of helplines is concerned, my Department has provided funding, since 2008, through the Commission for the Support for the Victims of Crime, for Missing in Ireland Support Services, MISS, a non-profit organisation that provides support to families and friends of missing persons.  A total of &euro;8,600 has been allocated to MISS in 2013, with &euro;8,600 provided in 2012 and &euro;9,000 in 2011.  My Department also provides accommodation for MISS.  I am informed that, in 2012,  MISS assisted 98 families and friends of missing persons.</p></reply>

The corresponding figures for 2011 and 2010 were 7,514 and 6,683 respectively.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide the cost for each case as this would necessitate a manual search of each record and would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort which could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources.</p><p>  It should be noted that the number of persons imprisoned at any time for non-payment of fines constitutes an extremely small part of the prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, there were 16 persons in custody on 27 May, 2013 for non-payment of a fine out of a total prison population of 4,245.  I am committed to pursuing alternatives to custody.  I am strongly of the view that we need to keep the numbers of people committed to prison for the non-payment of fines to the absolute minimum.</p><p>  I have already legislated to require judges to take a person&rsquo;s financial circumstances into account when setting a fine.  Work is now well under way on further major reforms to the fine payment and recovery system in Ireland.  The Fines (Amendment) Bill, which I expect to publish this term will, when enacted, make it easier for people to pay a fine and where they fail to do so, there will be sufficient options available to the courts in the form of, for example, attachment of earnings, community service, or recovery orders.  I believe these measures, taken together, will substantially reduce the incidence of committal to prison for the non-payment of fines.</p></reply>

The UNDOF mission was established by the United Nations on 31 May 1974 under United Nations Security Council Resolution 350 (1974) following the agreed disengagement of the Israeli and Syrian forces in the Golan Heights in May 1974.  Since 1974, the mandate of UNDOF has been renewed every six months.</p><p>  Irish personnel are due to deploy into the mission area circa 15 June 2013.  The Irish contribution to the mission will comprise a total of three personnel - two officers and one senior non-commissioned officer - to staff officer appointments in the information analysis cell in the headquarters of the mission at Camp Faouar in Syria.  Irish personnel will serve tours of duty of twelve months in duration.  UNDOF makes an important contribution to stability in the Middle East and participation by the Defence Forces in this mission will be a tangible demonstration of Ireland&rsquo;s support for the United Nations in the challenging operating conditions it faces in the region.</p></reply>

The office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, ODF, was established as an independent statutory office, under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.  The primary role of the ODF is to provide an independent appeals process for members of the Defence Forces who have processed a complaint through the internal Defence Forces redress of wrongs process but remain dissatisfied with the outcome or the manner in which the complaint was handled.  The 2004 Act also provides that, subject to certain conditions, the Ombudsman may accept complaints directly from former members of the Defence Forces.  The operational functions of the ODF, as provided for under the 2004 Act, commenced with effect from 1 December 2005.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Expenditure</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2006</div></td><td><div>&euro;275,156</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>&euro;597,765</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>&euro;465,018</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>&euro;491,696</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>&euro;438,791</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>&euro;485,973</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>&euro;413,209</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In the period from 1 December 2005 until mid September 2012 the role of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was filled on a full time basis.  However, a reduction in the number of cases being referred to the ODF was noted in recent years and, as a consequence, when the post became vacant in 2012 the new Ombudsman was appointed on a part time, three day week basis, subject to ongoing review of caseload and referrals.  This resulted in savings on the pay element of the ODF budget in 2012, savings which will be ongoing in 2013 and future years.</p></reply>

Coillte has advised, in relation to entry fees, that, while pedestrian access is free, the company has no plans to remove entry fees for vehicular access to its forest parks.  I am further advised that a fee of &euro;5 per car applies for access to the forest park but that an annual access card can be purchased online for &euro;40 for access to all forest parks on Coillte property.  The company also advises that Coillte has facilitated local school events, decisions on which are made on a case by case basis. </p><p>  I am aware of the importance of Donadea Forest Park as a recreational amenity in North Kildare.  With reference to the Government decision, in the context of the asset disposal programme, that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte&rsquo;s forests be put forward for sale, NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and this Department have examined the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte&rsquo;s forest assets. This examination included the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. Public access to recreational land, and the protection of such access, was one of the issues so identified and considered.  The overall analysis on the proposed sale of Coillte harvesting rights has been finalised, the outcome of which is currently being considered by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself.  It will be brought to Government in due course for consideration. </p></reply>

It has also called for its implementation in regard to the long standing dispute on mackerel and most recently on Atlanto Scandian Herring.  The European Commission&rsquo;s recent notification to the Faroe Islands pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 is in relation to their recent actions in the Atlanto Scandian Herring fishery. </p><p>  Since 1996 the stock of Atlanto Scandian Herring has been jointly managed in a Coastal States Framework with, the Russian Federation, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and the EU.</p><p>  In 2007, following consultations with the five Coastal States a long term management plan based on scientific advice was agreed by the parties. The intention of the plan was to deliver a sustainable fishery which kept catches within safe biological limits. </p><p>  In January this year the Faroe Islands withdrew from the Coastal States consultations, indicating their intention to declare an autonomous TAC for 2013. Prior to this withdrawal they had not made any specific demand, nor provided any substantive case for a revised share of the fishing resource.  On 23 January this year, the remaining four coastal states set their 2013 quotas in accordance with scientific advice and on the basis of the long term management plan and existing sharing arrangements. The four parties set aside 31,940t for the Faroe Islands equivalent to their traditional share of 5.16% of the overall TAC.</p><p>  The Faroe Islands subsequently set their own unilateral TAC at 105,230t for 2013; this decision ignores the agreed management plan, the scientifically recommended TAC for the stock and the legitimate rights of the other four coastal states.  The notification issued by the Commission to the Faroe Islands pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 is the first step in a process that could lead to the introduction of trade sanctions. However, it is designed to allow the country notified time to consider their position and take whatever remedial action necessary.  I support the decision by the Commission to issue this notification, and I am hopeful that a resolution can be found that does not necessitate a further escalation of the process.</p></reply>

Following consultation with Met Eireann, Co Ops, the farming organisations, Teagasc<font color="#004080"> </font>  and the advice of officials working on the ground, the decision was taken to allow a further two weeks for fodder to be imported into the country with a doubling of the transport subsidy fund to &euro;2 million.  Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country was covered up to Friday 24 May. I also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that were placed by that date, but which will not be delivered until this week, will be included under the scheme.  By the end of this week some 2,300 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 34,000 tonnes, will have benefited from my Department's contribution to these transport costs. My Department is monitoring the situation on a very regular basis.</p><p>  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.</p><p>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.  In this regard myself and my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr Phil Hogan, T.D., have announced a temporary and targeted adjustment of two provisions of the Nitrates Regulations to support additional fodder production on Irish farms in the coming months.  The adjustments involve: a discounting of some concentrate feeding when calculating the overall level of phosphorus allowed on grassland farms in 2013 and 2014; and an extension of two weeks to the period during with chemical fertiliser can be applied to grassland.</p><p>  Phosphorous is essential for grass growth. In order to ensure sufficient allowance of phosphorus for grassland application this year and 2014, some meal feeding in 2012 and 2013 will be discounted.  The period during which chemical fertiliser can be applied to land this year has been extended by two weeks up to and including 30 September 2013.  These measures will provide every opportunity to farmers to maximise grass growth and conservation into next Autumn.  </p><p>  For many farmers concerns regarding access to credit and flexibility around loan repayments have been a significant issue. I have been in contact with banks, co-ops and feed merchants to urge flexibility and co-operation at this challenging time. I am happy to note that a number of co-ops have introduced measures to support fertiliser usage, such as interest free credit terms for a period.</p></reply>

The applicant accepted that he did not have the right to declare the dual-claimed parcel, and also that he had over-claimed on the second parcel. Consequently, the application was processed, with penalty, as provided for in the Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme.</p><p>  In addition, in order to comply with EU requirements, the applicant was selected for a Cross Compliance inspection which took place on 31 May 2012. The inspection recorded breaches relating to both nitrates and cattle identification/registration requirements.

This application has been approved for &euro;50,240 for the establishment and operational period from June to December 2012 and &euro;87,631 for 2013.

There have been numerous press releases issued by the DCYA and the ISPCC, the 116 000 Missing Children Hotline has been covered in the print (9 articles) and broadcast (6 radio stations) media since opening in May 2012.  There has also been an on- going website and social media presence utilising ISPCC, Facebook and Twitter to highlight the service as well as information on missing children. ISPCC staff and volunteers have worked to disseminate posters in local areas and posters have been distributed nationally by the Garda&iacute;.  The Missing Children Hotline will be officially launched on the 7th of June 2013. Following this launch the awareness campaign for the service will be escalated nationally. A dedicated  website www.missingchildrenhotline.ie will also be launched by the ISPCC.</p><p>  In addition I can confirm that memoranda of understanding between the ISPCC and the HSE, my Department and the Garda&iacute;, respectively were finalised in advance of the commencement of the pilot in December 2012.  Tthe funding received from both the EU Daphne fund and from my Department includes, in the establishment costs, the national promotion and advertisement of this Hotline service.</p><p>  The missing children hotline has been operating on a fulltime basis since end April, 2013.  Reliable data on calls is not available prior to this point.  The ISPCC will submit quarterly activity data to my Department, which will include information on the number of calls received by the service.

The CCS programme, which is provided through more than 900 community services throughout the country, is a major support programme for parents.  Approximately 19,500 families are availing of the CCS programme in the current school year at an estimated cost of &euro;50 million.  </p><p>  Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  </p><p>  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility.  The overall charge is based on the total costs incurred by the facility in providing the service and can vary depending on what the level of overhead costs are.  However, all services participating in the CCS programme must submit a fees policy to my Department before funding under the CCS programme is provided in order to ensure that the full value of the subvention provided by my Department is passed on to the parent(s).  Any parent with concerns in relation to fees charged can raise the issue with the local County Childcare Committee or with the Childcare Directorate in my Department.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>In 2013, my Department's Youth Affairs Unit will provide total funding to For&oacute;ige of &euro;5.93 million.</p><p><table><tr><th> Programme</th><th> Amount in 2013</th></tr><tr><td> Youth Service Grant Scheme </td><td> &euro;2,651,154 </td></tr><tr><td> Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund  (1 &amp;amp; 2)</td><td> &euro;1,195,283</td></tr><tr><td> Special Project for Youth</td><td> &euro;2,083,572</td></tr><tr><td> Total</td><td> &euro;5,930,009</td></tr></table></p><p>This total does not include local youth clubs grants, funded by my Department, but allocated to local clubs by and at the discretion of local VECs.</p><p>This total does not include funding provided to For&oacute;ige with respect to Garda youth diversion projects or funding from other state agencies such as the HSE.</p><p>The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. In 2014 the savings required in the youth budget under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure amount to &euro;2.976m which entails a 5% cut across most schemes and programmes and a 10% cut on the Youth Service Grant Scheme, under which For&oacute;ige receives funding as a national organisation.</p><p>Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.</p><p>In 2011, For&oacute;ige, following an internal review of the organisation&rsquo;s wide range of provision for young people, reprioritised its areas of youth provision and programmes.  This reprioritisation, which was proposed to my Department, enabled For&oacute;ige to strengthen their Big Brother Big Sister (BBBS) Programme nationally.  For&oacute;ige decided, with the permission of my Department, to reallocate the funding provided by my Department from their Youth Information services to the Big Brother Big Sister Programme.  Additional funding was also provided by my Department to For&oacute;ige for the Big Brother Big Sister Programme in 2012 and 2013.  While I fully appreciate the value of the Big Brother Big Sister Programme and the challenges facing it in the current fiscal climate, given the savings required within my Department's budget under the CRE, I do not envisage any further scope for the provision of any further increase on the funding already provided to For&oacute;ige.</p><p>A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this report will inform the future development of youth programmes and services.</p><p>My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.

To date, Sections 2-7, 17, 18 and 24 of the Act have been commenced. In particular, Sections 17 and 18 provide for the establishment of a National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC).  In this regard, I appointed a new Advisory Committee with effect from 28 January 2013 for a period of one year.  Its work is currently focussing on the contribution of youth work  to youth policy and youth employment.</p><p>  Action 231 in the National Action Plan for Jobs identifies the requirement to develop a new Youth Policy Framework to review youth funding schemes to ensure that youth work and the non-formal education sector contribute effectively to youth employment, including skills development and experimental learning opportunities for individuals and groups of young people.  </p><p>  My Department is developing a new strategy for children and young people. In keeping with my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for children and young people, this new five-year Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way which will comprehend the continuum of the life-course from infancy through to early and middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.  It will be the overarching Framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.  </p><p>  The overarching Framework will provide the basis for more detailed strategies including  a new youth policy framework. This youth policy framework, for publication later this year, will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and in making them more responsive to meeting the needs of young people, including in addressing the challenge of youth employment.  It is intended that the Youth Work Act, 2001 will be reviewed in the context of developing this specific Framework. I am consulting with the NYWAC in this regard and in particular in identifying in what ways the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment.</p></reply>

The purpose of this initiative is to work towards better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of policies and services, in particular through the Children&rsquo;s Services Committees at local level.  Children&rsquo;s Services Committees (CSCs)  bring together a diverse group of agencies in local county areas to engage in joint planning of services for children. These include representatives from the HSE, local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, VECs, National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, Irish Primary Principals Network, NEWB, and other organisations who provide services to children and young people. There are 16 CSCs at various stages of development.</p><p>  My Department is currently finalising the details of the local authority areas where CSCs have been established along with the coordinators names and contact details and I will provide these details directly to the Deputy over the coming days.  These Committees are not fiscally independent of their constituent memberships and do not therefore operate within independent budgets.  Where funds are made available to support their activities, these generally reside in a constituent organisation.</p><p>   In 2013, &euro;108,000 was allocated towards the establishment and development of CSCs. The initiative hopes to secure better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of policies and services.  In addition, &euro;100,000 has also been allocated by my Department in 2013 towards the recruitment of a National Coordinator for the CSC Initiative and part-time administrative support, who will be hosted by the Centre for Effective Services (CES).  This National Coordinator will work with my Department, the new Child and Family Support Agency and will provide strategic leadership to the Children&rsquo;s Services Committees (CSCs) Initiative. I understand that following a competitive process the post has been offered to a candidate who is due to take up the role next month.</p></reply>

The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability. The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland. </p><p>  For a small number of young people, the HSE is on occasion required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not currently available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  These placements are made under the order and supervision of the High Court.</p><p>  The HSE ensure that these placements are suitable and the child's social worker visits regularly and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit.  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.  The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the HSE's National Director for Children an Family Services.  I have been advised by the HSE that the average cost to the State of a young person's placement in St. Andrews in Northampton is approximately &pound;10,000 - &pound;12,000 per week.</p></reply>

A Special Care Unit provides secure residential service to children and young people who are in need of specialised targeted intervention.  Children are detained in special care if their behaviour is deemed to pose a risk to themselves. The detention, by order of the High Court of a child in a Special Care Unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable. Special Care Units are inspected by HIQA under Section 69 of the Child Care Act, 1991 on an annual basis, and the inspection reports are published.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   </p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.</p><p>  Service providers seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner.  There is, however, no obligation on childcare services to provide for places under the Programme.</p></reply>

We are lucky that in Ireland we have generally positive parental&ndash;child relationships. For example, the &lsquo;State of Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; Report which I published earlier this year indicates that 82% of children aged 10-17 reported that they find it easy to talk to their mother when something is really bothering them.</p><p>  A further report from last year by Dr. Elizabeth Nixon, based on Growing Up in Ireland data and focusing on &lsquo;How Families Matter for Children&rsquo;s Social and Emotional Well-Being&rsquo;, highlighted just how instrumental parents and families are for child well-being and this cannot be emphasised enough.  It also highlighted how parenting can have just as great an impact on a child&rsquo;s life chances as family structure, income or social class.  Put simply, good parenting is crucial for children&rsquo;s outcomes.  That is why this Government and I have committed to supporting children, parents and families.</p><p>  The HSE Child &amp;amp; Family Services, along with the existing Family Support Agency, fund a variety of programmes to support families and parenting. The National Educational Welfare Board, which comes under my Department&rsquo;s remit, provides funding to the Teen Parents Support Programme.  These various bodies will shortly be incorporated into the new Child and Family Agency. At the heart of the Agency will be an enhanced focus on early intervention and family support; and this will be greatly supported by the inclusion of the nationwide network of 106 Family Resource Centres.  I believe that establishing this new Agency presents us with a very exciting opportunity to consolidate and develop effective, evidence-based parenting and family supports.  </p><p>  In addition, a range of parenting programmes, including home visitation services, have been introduced under the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme which has been funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  Evaluations to date of the three sites in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale have shown that parenting programmes can have a positive impact in tackling the early onset of behavioural and emotional problems among children as well as reducing parental stress and improving parental well-being.  Building on the critical learning emerging from the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme I hope to see effective, evidence-based parenting supports being included in the new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty which is currently being established on foot of funding announced in Budget 2013,</p><p>  The work of the new Child &amp;amp; Family Agency and the Area Based Approach to Child Poverty, as well as broader policy and programme delivery across Government, will be advised by ongoing work on the Government&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s &amp;amp; Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework and Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy, work on both of which is at an advanced stage.  The Early Years Strategy has been a specific priority for me and I see the Strategy as providing an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.  Policy considerations relating to supports for families and parenting will be considered in the context of the ongoing preparation of these strategies.</p><p>  In the case of the Early Years Strategy, I have established an Expert Advisory Group and this group has had specific and focused meetings on the issue of parental support including presentations by the Centre of Effective Services who have shared the learning from their evaluations of early intervention and prevention programmes and the work of the Special Interest Group on Parenting which they have established and facilitated.</p></reply>

This is an inspection rate of over 61% in a single year.  This compares very favourably with comparable jurisdictions such as England, where Ofsted operates a policy of inspecting childcare providers on a 3 &ndash; 4 year cycle.  However, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.  This pilot will inform the proactive approach being taken by my Department.</p></reply>

However, it is not possible to use HIPE or NPRS data to determine the underlying reason behind specific treatments.

The most recent information available indicates that as of 30th April, 2013, 383 posts have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  The National Recruitment Service (NRS) of the HSE creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.  On occasion however, it is difficult to fill some posts for various reasons including geographical location, international shortage of some grades, most notably clinical Psychologists etc.  The NRS is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, subject to appropriately qualified candidates being available.</p><p>  A further &euro;35m was provided in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services and 477 posts have been approved to implement these measures.  In March, each of the four HSE regions were asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  The business cases have been received and examined and approval has issued to three of the Regions, HSE Dublin North East, HSE South and HSE West and it is expected that approval will issue to the remaining HSE Region shortly.  When the Approval Letters issue, the Regional Directors of Operations will ensure that the necessary paperwork is submitted to the NRS and the recruitment process will commence.  I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013, and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012, is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  The specific details asked by the Deputy in the question are operational matters for the HSE.

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, including cochlear implantation.  It includes a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.  It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant.</p><p>  The HSE has advised that it is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation, and that it has obtained the services of an international expert in the implementation of cochlear implant programmes to advise on how best to progress the proposal.  The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates Process.</p><p>  Minister Kathleen Lynch, with officials from my Department and the HSE, met with Happy New Ear on 22 May last in relation to the provision of bilateral cochlear implantation, and has outlined to them the progress being made in this regard.  I understand that this was a very positive meeting and the group welcomed the proposed plan and approach to developing  a bilateral cochlear implant programme.</p></reply>

This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus has been on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, while always respecting the requirements of competition law. The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.</p><p>  The Forum met five times during 2012. In addition, bilateral meetings took  place with each insurer  (i.e. Quinn Healthcare (now known as Laya), Aviva and VHI) in March 2012 where they brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market. Following its entry on to the Irish market, GloHealth accepted an invitation to join the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance in August 2012. The Forum has met twice so far in 2013, on 31st January and 28th March, and it is intended that a number of issues will be considered during the course of this year, including:</p><p> - costs and affordability in the context of a sustainable market</p><p> - data-sharing</p><p> - the establishment of a Subgroup to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market, and</p><p> - measures to encourage greater participation of younger, healthier people in the market.</p><p>  In addition to the ongoing work of the Forum, a Subgroup of the Consultative Forum was established earlier this year to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market. The third meeting of this Subgroup, with membership comprising two representatives from each insurer and representation from the HIA and my Department, took place earlier this month. The Subgroup provides a valuable opportunity for insurers to contribute views and proposals on initiatives which could assist the sustainability of the private health insurance market, such as lifetime community rating and the possible introduction of a standard plan or core set of benefits to the health insurance market. Further work will be undertaken by the Subgroup over the coming months to further consider the merits and viability of such proposals, with a view to overseeing the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the Consultative Forum will continue to provide a useful platform for continued engagement with the commercial insurers and I welcome any other measures or initiatives that insurers wish to contribute as part of the ongoing work of the Forum, and the Subgroup, which would be considered beneficial to maintain affordability in the private health insurance market.</p></reply>

I expect to receive the final Report this week and I will then carefully consider the overall position in relation to women who have undergone symphysiotomy in the light of the findings of this Report and any other relevant information.  I will then brief the Government on the matter as quickly as possible.  Before publication of the Report, I will brief the support groups representing the women who have had symphysiotomies.</p><p>  My first priority is to ensure that the women who have had this procedure have their health needs comprehensively and professionally met.  In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who continue to suffer the effects of having had this procedure.  These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.</p></reply>

My priority is to ensure that those affected by narcolepsy, with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with a range of services and supports to meet their health needs.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.</p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred.  This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination, in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.</p><p>  The Deputy has raised a query regarding an individual case.

Both my Ministerial colleagues, myself and officials from the Department regularly meet with stakeholders from across the public, private and voluntary sector to discuss policies, services and developments including those for Older People.  In fact officials of the Department have recently met and are always happy to receive suggestions and other input from Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), which has called for the establishment of a forum of this nature.</p><p>  The Department established a Working Group to develop the policy document &ldquo;Towards a Restraint Free Environment in Nursing Homes&rdquo;.  Representatives from Nursing Homes Ireland were included on the Group.  The Department has also engaged with NHI in the development of Care and Welfare Regulations and in the recent review of these regulations.  Other recent examples of the type of consultation carried out include the development of the new National Positive Ageing Strategy and the National Strategy on Dementia.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department is currently conducting a Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to examine, inter alia, the on-going sustainability of the Scheme.  A public consultation process, which NHI contributed to, has already been undertaken to inform the Review.  Summary reports of the latter consultations are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The establishment of an additional formal consultation forum such as that suggested by NHI is not considered necessary given the very effective level of consultation that already takes place and to which we remain committed for the future.</p></reply>

This is a necessary feature of the Scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  If price negotiations break down a three stage review process, developed by the NTPF, can be invoked.  Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.</p><p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in October, 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that trends and statistics will be available in order to inform the work.  The Terms of Reference for the review of the Scheme include an examination of the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices.  The Deputy will be aware that a public consultation to inform the review was concluded and a summary report of the submissions received was published on the Department's website in December 2012.  Work will continue on the review in the coming months and the Department will shortly be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for external input to this review.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed by end 2013- early 2014.  As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review may require significant amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.</p></reply>

The Authority's mandate extends across the quality and safety of the public, private (within its social care function) and voluntary sectors.  HIQA has statutory responsibility for</p><p> - Setting Standards for Health and Social Services,</p><p> - Social Services Inspectorate,</p><p> - Monitoring Healthcare Quality,</p><p> - Health Technology Assessment,</p><p> - Health Information. </p><p>  The functions of HIQA are defined in the Act and the Authority operates within a set of values and Codes of Conduct.

Information regarding the complaints procedure may be found at .  </p><p>  Since the introduction of the registration and inspection regime for the nursing home sector in 2009 there have been relatively few appeals, formal or informal, in respect of the Authority's inspection or enforcement activity.  This is set in the context of the registration of over 570 designated centres and in excess of 2,500 inspection reports.  In addition the Ombudsman (Amendment) 2012 extended the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman to over 180 additional public bodies, including HIQA.  From 1 May 2013 the Ombudsman can examine complaints from members of the public about the administrative actions of these bodies.

The number of Northern Irish cases is estimated to be 120 surgical cases per year.   Even if the majority of Northern Irish cardiac surgery patients are transferred within the United Kingdom it is accepted that there may be an ongoing requirement for up to 30 emergency/urgent cardiac surgery cases a year to be referred to Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  This is because for some patients, the need for surgical intervention is so critically urgent, that air transport to another UK centre would be inappropriate.</p><p>  In Northern Ireland there is a desire that at least some services continue to be delivered in Belfast for paediatric cardiac patients, and the options for this are being explored by both sides.  Discussions are planned this week on the clinical aspects of the proposed services, after which it is expected that the proposals will be put to the Ministers North and South for agreement, with a view to putting the agreed services in place as soon as possible.  Resources can currently be put in place in Crumlin Hospital for the services to begin ramping up at the end of 2013, with the full service in place in 2014.  The funding arrangements for the proposed services have not been finalised, and as such I cannot go into detail on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

It causes joints to be flexible and unstable, skin that tears easily and fragile blood vessels. There are a number of genetic mutations that give rise to the condition. Incidence data for Ireland is not available however international evidence for some of the gene mutations indicates incidence rates from between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 250,000 people. Diagnostic tests typically include genetic testing, skin biopsies, cardiac evaluation and other biochemical tests. The treatments are mainly palliative to reduce the complications from the condition.

The DART Underground tunnel element which had been proposed as a PPP required significant Exchequer support and is not currently affordable given the level of resources available for transport investment. Together with  Metro North it will be reviewed again in advance of the next capital plan which will commence in  2016. </p><p>  In this regard I have  instructed my Department to commence work on a &ldquo;Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport&rdquo; as a foundation document to inform that plan.  As part of the development of this framework, the National Transport Authority (NTA) which is responsible for the planning and development of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) has been tasked with examining the transport investment needs in the GDA region focussing particularly on the two major public transport proposals &ndash; Metro North and DART Underground.  The outcome of that work will then be analysed and will inform the preparation of the Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Updated costings and likely funding options will only be available  at that stage.   </p><p>  Prior to its postponement the European Investment Bank (EIB) had indicated a keen interest in supporting DART Underground and this interest was confirmed to me at a  recent meeting I had with the EIB Management Board.  As regards EU funding DART Underground is currently part of the Trans European Network (TEN-T) Belfast-Dublin-Cork Priority Project. It will also be included in the updated Core Ten-T Network and I have  also proposed that it be designated part of a specific Core Corridor under the Regulations governing the next round of Ten-T funding for the period 2014 -2020. This means that if the Dart Underground project or elements of the overall programme are included in the next capital programme they will be eligible for some limited co- funding under Ten-T.</p><p>  I expect that  DART Underground  will remain a key element of the  overall transport integration strategy as it would deliver a quantum improvement in rail accessibility to the city centre with benefits for each of the four rail corridors radiating from the city centre.  The timing of its  delivery however is heavily dependent on economic recovery and access to a variety of funding sources.</p></reply>

The analysis found that there was very limited demand for movement between the regional cities and militated " against substantial investment in providing connections between the regional cities, other than in those areas where the catchments of connected cities partially overlap, and InterCity connections allow both catchments to be connected with their relative city centres on a single service".</p><p>  The AECOM report also examined the potential for further expansion of the rail network in the North West, including further phases of the Western Rail Corridor from Tuam to Claremorris and Collooney (providing for a direct rail connection between Limerick, Galway and Sligo) and Derry to Letterkenny, but found that the potential demand and economic return is insufficient to merit this investment.</p><p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) points out that Cork and Galway are connected by commercial express bus services provided by Citylink with a journey time of 3 hrs 20 minutes. Bus Eireann commercial Route 51 also provides this connection albeit on a multi stop service taking 4 hours 20 minutes. These are provided at no cost to the Exchequer whereas increasing rail services and improving rail journey times would require additional resources and investment which would have to be taken from other routes.</p><p>  There are no current plans to extend the rail network e.g. in the North West and the primary focus will be the delivery of cost effective public bus and rural transport services in such areas.</p><p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo; s allocation for investment outside of the Greater Dublin area for 2013 is &euro;105m. The vast majority of this allocation goes towards the Rail Safety Programme with a view to to ensuring that the current infrastructure is fit for purpose. In addition to safety related works Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is undertaking infrastructural works to improve journey times such as removing or upgrading level-crossings, providing automated ticketing machines, improving station facilities - all of which contribute to making the railway more competitive and attractive to passengers.</p></reply>

My Department is currently administering a multi annual funding programme related to the development of the National Cycle Network (NCN) to cover the period 2012 to 2016.  Significant investment has already been made in 2012 and 2013 with &euro;7 million allocated to projects across Ireland.  This funding, which is provided to local authorities, will help to deliver cycleways in keeping with the objectives of the National Cycle Policy Framework.  As this phase of the programme will expire at the end of 2013, it is my intention to initiate a new funding call later this year to provide, through competitive process, a further tranche of funding for the remainder of the years to 2016.</p><p>  The development of a greenway from Kilmorna to Listowel is  principally a matter for Kerry County Council.  Any plans to develop this stretch of rail line as a greenway by  Kerry County Council could be submitted to the Department under the next phase of the NCN funding programme, once initiated, although it should be noted that requests for funding are likely to significantly exceed the funds available and it is possible that only a small proportion of the projects seeking funding will be supported.</p></reply>
