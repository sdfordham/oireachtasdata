That is what this Government is doing through prudent management of the public finances.</p><p>At a more micro-economic level Budget 2017 contains several measures designed to ensure that firms in Ireland - especially those in the SME sector - are prepared for a potentially more difficult trading environment.  This includes tailoring the wide range of State supports currently available such as:</p><p>-  Low cost credit and increased credit supply from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland;</p><p>-  Funding for growth and efficiency from Enterprise Ireland;</p><p>-  Financing from Microfinance Ireland for micro enterprises affected by the UK referendum. </p><p>Specific tax measures included:</p><p>-  Retention of the reduced 9 per cent VAT rate for the hospitality sector - a measure sought by Retail Ireland in their pre-budget submission.</p><p>-  Reduced Capital Gains Tax (CGT) to help entrepreneurs. </p><p>-  Extension of the Foreign Earnings Deduction</p><p>-  Extension of the Special Assignee Relief Programme </p><p>-  An increase to the Earned Income Tax Credit for self-employed tax payers </p><p>-  Introduction of an income averaging &quot;step-out&quot; in the agriculture sector </p><p>It is crucial to maintain competitiveness and in particular in those areas which we can influence.  It is also important to stress that the recent depreciation of sterling is likely to increase UK consumer prices in the near term as increases in import prices give rise to additional inflationary pressures.  This will mitigate some of the negative impact on the retail sector in Ireland from the depreciation in sterling.</p></reply>

This projects that for this year VAT revenues will be &euro;12.6 billion, which represents a 5.7 per cent or &euro;690 million increase on the preceding year.  This revised forecast is 1.8 per cent or &euro;230 million below the original Budget 2016 projection.  As an ad valorem tax, VAT returns have been affected by, amongst other factors, the current low inflation environment prevailing across the economy.  This is reflected in the forecast personal consumption deflator for 2016.  In Budget 2017, it was projected that it would increase by 1.1% in 2016 as against an expected 1.8% increase in Budget 2016 when it was announced in October 2015.</p><p>Turning to the overall VAT performance year to-date, the October Exchequer returns published last week show that cumulative receipts are up 4.7 per cent or about &euro;475 million annually.  This is 2.6 per cent or &euro;290 million below the original Budget 2016 profile. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the bulk of VAT is paid up to two months in arrears, with the bulk of VAT payments arriving every second month in what are generally referred to as the &quot;VAT-due&quot; months.  So, in September, the last &quot;VAT-due&quot; month, the receipts relate to the JulyAugust trading period. </p><p>Looking at the performance in the &quot;VAT-due&quot; months, &euro;2.1 billion was received in January, &euro;1.5 billion in March, &euro;1.9 billion in May, &euro;1.8 billion in July and &euro;1.9 billion in September.</p><p>During the alternate 'off-peak 'months where receipts are lower, &euro;300 million was received in February, &euro;270 million in April, &euro;190 million in June, &euro;290 million in August and &euro;320 million in October.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have indicated the revised 2016 VAT forecast of &euro;12.6 billion contained in Budget 2017 is reasonable and is consistent with their view of the likely outturn for this year.</p></reply>

The proposal was considered in detail.  However, given the significant SME supports that had been put in place by the Government to support SME financing, including the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland's (SBCI), the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office, it was not clear at that time how local public banks would avoid replicating these already available supports. </p>  <p>  The success of these policies can be seen in increases in new lending from bank and non-bank sources, the number of new credit providers active in the market and the reduction in average interest rates for SMEs.  In order for businesses to access these significant levels of credit, they should seek advice from the Enterprises Agencies on how to prepare and present a viable business plan.  My Department will continue to examine actions that increase the availability of credit to SMEs.</p></reply>

The legal grounds under which the Governor made this decision are set out in the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it made an application on 2 November 2016 to the High Court to have joint provisional liquidators appointed to Rush Credit Union Limited.  Jim Luby and Tom Rogers of McStay Luby were appointed as joint provisional liquidators on that date by the President of the High Court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly.  The full application will be heard on 21 November, when the Central Bank will seek the winding up of Rush Credit Union Ltd.  The Central Bank took this action in order to ensure the protection of members' savings.  The credit union will not re-open and all issues relating to the wind down of services will be managed by the Joint Provisional Liquidators. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that its objective is to be as transparent as possible by providing information to reassure credit union members regarding the actions taken.  For legal reasons, the Central Bank is constrained in terms of the specific details it can provide, pending the decision of the High Court on 21 November 2016.  The Central Bank will publish the Resolution Report and Affidavit (on a redacted basis) on its website following the full hearing for the winding up of Rush Credit Union Ltd in the High Court on 21 November 2016.</p>  <p>  Following the appointment of the Joint Provisional Liquidators the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) has been invoked.  Members of Rush Credit Union Ltd will receive compensation in respect of their eligible deposits up to &euro;100,000 per member.  The DGS will make compensation payments as early as possible within the statutory deadline of 20 working days to duly verified depositors. </p>  <p>  Rush Credit Union Ltd has been monitored by the Central Bank over a number of years and during that time the Central Bank investigated aspects of its business.  The Central Bank is of the view that there are a number of reasons for the failure of Rush Credit Union Ltd which have manifested over an extended period of time.  These include issues relating to governance, internal controls, lending practices and valuation of its premises.  Despite assurances given by Rush Credit Union Ltd to the Central Bank, and the credit union having been provided with an opportunity to address the issues concerned, in the opinion of the Central Bank, they have not been adequately addressed.  In applying for winding up, the Central Bank has also considered Rush Credit Union Ltd's recent financial performance and its constrained capacity to ameliorate its distressed financial position.  In the absence of taking the proposed action, the nature of the financial, governance and internal controls issues, could lead to a disorderly collapse of Rush Credit Union Ltd.</p>  <p>  The registration and regulation of credit unions is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions within the Central Bank, who is the independent regulator for credit unions.  The Central Bank is keen that credit union services are available to the people of Rush and Lusk.  I share this view.  The Central Bank informs me that it is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and will examine what arrangements can be put in place to provide specific credit union services in the community in the future.  In some cases, members may currently be able to avail of services in another credit union in the area as the common bond may extend into their locality or through their place of work.  </p>  <p>  While the Central Bank is willing and prepared to take the necessary action to protect the savings of credit union members, it remains fully supportive of the credit union sector in Ireland and is committed to the continued development of a strong and sustainable sector that meets members' changing needs and protects their savings.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country.  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-10a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111000064#WRA01800"><p>As the deputy is aware, significant progress has been made across the Irish banking sector in reducing the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) since the financial crisis.  This has been primarily achieved by customers engaging directly with their banks and agreeing a sustainable payment plan which allows the customer an achievable path out of arrears, as well as protecting the value of the loan for the bank.  In many cases these agreements have included elements of debt restructuring and writedowns. This is the most equitable means of dealing with problem loans for both borrowers and lenders, and I would urge all those in arrears to engage constructively with their bank in order to reach an appropriate repayment arrangement.  In the vast majority of cases this achieves the best outcome for all involved. </p>  <p>  Despite the significant progress made, the levels of NPLs in the Irish banking sector remain elevated by European standards.  Banks are under pressure to reduce these exposures, both from their regulator and the market.  Notwithstanding whether or not the State is a shareholder, it is the management and board of each institution that are tasked with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge. </p>  <p>  In recent years banks have introduced multiple engagement channels to facilitate those customers who are reluctant to engage directly with them.  Having exhausted these initiatives, if meaningful engagement is not forthcoming from particular customers the bank may be left with no option but to look at alternative solutions which could, as a last resort, include the sale of the loan.</p>  <p>  As the deputy will know, I as Minister for Finance have no role in the day-to-day management of the Irish banks.  Notwithstanding that the state is a significant shareholder in a AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, these banks are run on an independent and commercial basis.  Strategic decisions for these institutions, such as a decision to sell any asset or portfolio of assets, are the sole remit of the management and board of each bank.  The terms of my relationship as Minister for Finance with the banks in which the state is a shareholder fall under the Relationship Framework Agreements in place with each institution.  These relationship framework agreements are available on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank in its role as regulator, oversees the conduct of all providers and servicers of mortgage products in the state.  Legislation ensures that all mortgage holders are entitled to their full contractual and conduct rights, regardless of the owner of the loan.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 was enacted in July 2015 and is designed to protect relevant borrowers whose loans are sold on to unregulated entities.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  These are firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  Under the  Consumer Protection Act 2015 relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, issued by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The individuals at which the programme is aimed often have an input into the decision as to where the company will locate new projects.  Such individuals could persuade companies to make their investments in competitor countries in the absence of this incentive.  This relief complements our competitive corporate tax offering.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that detailed reports regarding the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) are published online by Revenue Commissioners in the statistical reports section of their website.  These reports provide information on the conditions, eligibility and the calculation of the relief.  Furthermore, there are statistics covering both the uptake of the relief and the cost to the Exchequer from 2012 to 2014, the latest year for which figures are available.  As the self assessment tax returns for 2015 are only due to be submitted to Revenue about now, statistics for 2015 are not yet available but will be published in due course.</p>  <p>  Take up of the scheme has increased year on year.  The first year of the programme was 2012 and in that year 12 employees availed of SARP relief at a cost of &euro;112,000.  Employers reported that 6 jobs were created, and 6 retained as a result of the relief.</p>  <p>  In 2013, 121 employees claimed SARP at a cost of &euro;1.9 million, with employers reporting that 49 jobs were created and 215 jobs retained as a result of the relief.</p>  <p>  The most recent report on SARP, in respect of the 2014 tax year, showed that 302 employees availed of it in that year.  Employers reported that 126 jobs were created and 708 retained as a result of the relief.  The cost to the Exchequer of the scheme in 2014 was almost &euro;6 million. </p>  <p>  If these jobs had not been created or retained then the Exchequer would have lost the associated income tax, USC and PRSI, as well as any additional economic activity, as a result of spending in the economy.  I would also add that the impact of SARP should not be measured in terms of job creation alone as the measure acts to secure and embed investment, which delivers sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland's innovative capabilities.  Accordingly, I propose to extend it to 2020 in the current Finance Bill.</p></reply>

My Department is involved in ongoing monitoring of developments as they arise and is part of the cross governmental approach on the consequences of the UK's vote to leave the EU led by the Department of an Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The NTMA and my Department are monitoring, on an ongoing basis, developments in the bond markets in the context of the UK referendum.  In the period since the referendum, the NTMA has completed three separate bond auctions most recently just last week, on 3rd November.  With the completion of last week's final bond auction of 2016, the NTMA has issued &euro;8.25 billion nominal from its stated target range of &euro;610 billion in the bond markets this year, at a weighted average yield of 0.82 per cent.</p>  <p>  These debt issuances have occurred at a time when Irish Sovereign borrowing yields have remained at close to record lows of approximately 0.5% for 10 year Government bonds.  These low yields are as a result of domestic factors, principally Ireland's improving debt dynamics and our continued commitment to prudent fiscal management, as well as international factors including the ECB's monetary policy measures.  Importantly, the NTMA's debt issuances earlier in the year have allowed it to lock in longer maturities at low interest rates, which is positive for debt servicing costs and will be important when interest rates return to normal.</p>  <p>  Ireland's fundamental debt dynamics are improving and debt servicing costs are declining.  These improved fundamentals mean that Ireland has now regained its A-rating with all the major credit rating agencies, following Moody's upgrade earlier this year.</p>  <p>  The Exchequer's funding position is strong due to the activities of the NTMA in 2016 and the fact that it has limited financing needs in the months ahead.  Exchequer cash and other liquid short-term investment balances stood at &euro;9 billion at end-October 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department forecasts a 2017 Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR) of &euro;2.2 billon.  The current outstanding balance on the 2017 maturing Government bond is &euro;6.3 billion.  That bond does not mature until October of next year.  The NTMA have advised me that they will announce their funding plan, including a planned bond issuance range for 2017, next month.</p></reply>

To do so would irreparably damage NAMA's positive contribution to our recovery and damage our reputation as a credible, open and transparent market.  By extension, any such interference would be detrimental to the interests of Irish taxpayers.</p>  <p>  Halting NAMA's activities would constitute the State taking direct control of NAMA and bring NAMA onto the State's balance sheet, increasing Government debt by over &euro;3.5 billion at a time when Government policy is to reduce the State's debt.  This would constitute a complete u-turn by the Irish sovereign in the eyes of the rating agencies, the sovereign bond market and broader investor community, potentially increasing the cost of government debt, damaging confidence in the recovery of our economy, negatively impacting all of us.</p>  <p>  Such action also would raise serious competition concerns limiting the State's flexibility in recovering value from NAMA's remaining assets.  Such action would also create significant challenges for NAMA in retaining staff and preserving a viable platform.</p>  <p>  It is important to understand that NAMA's remaining deleveraging is required to eliminate the remaining &euro;3.5bn government guaranteed senior debt, a contingent liability for the State.  Halting NAMA's deleveraging would stall the funding of the 20,000 anticipated residential units and threaten the commercial development in the Dublin Docklands SDZ.  It would also reduce or eliminate the &euro;1.6 - &euro;2.3bn ultimate surplus expected from NAMA if current market dynamics persist.</p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised issues regarding Project Eagle for further discussion.  He has not raised any systemic concern about NAMA and its operations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has not called for a halt to NAMA's activities, which he no doubt would have, had he felt such action was warranted.</p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General report is currently being examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee is the appropriate forum in which to consider this report.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that it has its own responsibilities in all matters of public concern to do with the functions of an important public body such as NAMA.  As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach has indicated a willingness to establish a Commission of Investigation into matters of public concern that may require further investigation and the most appropriate nature and terms of reference of such an investigation.  The Government's objective is to ensure all matters of public concern will be addressed in a speedy and effective manner.</p></reply>

It is hoped that turning notional demand into real demand will generate the supply response by the market.  With the assistance of the scheme, many first-time buyers who want to buy new starter homes would be in a better position to secure deposits and obtain approval for mortgages.  In turn, this would mean that developers who may have been struggling to raise funding to build properties will be in a position to point to this increased real demand in their own negotiations with lenders, and therefore be in a position to build more new homes.</p>  <p>  Extending the scheme to apply to second hand properties would have no impact on increasing the supply of new homes being built and thus could not contribute to increased supply.  As a result, I will not reconsider allowing second hand properties to fall within the scope of the rebate.</p>  <p>  In addition, when devising the scheme I was conscious that if a cap on the maximum house price was set at too low a level, then the scheme would be limited in terms of the cohort that it may be able to assist.  Setting this cap at too low a level could also lead to individuals falsifying their property prices in order to qualify.  Thus, I decided that I would set a higher cap so that first time buyers struggling with high property prices, especially those in Dublin where prices are highest, would not be excluded entirely from the scheme.</p>  <p>  I brought forward an amendment to the proposed cap at Committee Stage yesterday.  This reduces the valuation at which properties are no longer eligible for the scheme from &euro;600,000 to &euro;500,000.  I have no plans to reduce this cap any further.  The maximum rebate of income tax paid available under the scheme remains capped at 5 per cent of the price of the house up to &euro;400,000, or a maximum available rebate of &euro;20,000 per property.</p></reply>

The budget took Brexit into consideration in both its framing and its detail.  In terms of framing, my Department incorporated the potential impact of Brexit into the macroeconomic forecasts for next year that underpinned Budget 2017.  My Department also published an in-depth analysis of the sectors of the Irish economy and highlighted those with the greatest trade exposure to the UK.</p>  <p>  In light of the findings of the Department of Finance's in-depth sector analysis a number of taxation measures were announced in the Budget, with a view to getting Ireland "Brexit ready".  The detail of these sectoral measures are that they reduced Capital Gains Tax to help entrepreneurs bringing this relief more in line with that in operation in the UK.  There was an extension and amendment of the Foreign Earnings Deduction to help Irish exporters to diversify their export and import markets as some sectors of the Irish economy are shown to be highly reliant on the UK as an export destination.</p>  <p>  The Budget contained an extension of the Special Assignee Relief Programme to assist businesses to relocate key staff to Ireland to provide certainty for foreign direct investment in Ireland.  Many sectors in Ireland that are exposed to the UK have a high percentage of small and Irish owned enterprises.  The increase to the Earned Income Tax Credit for self-employed tax payers will aid these enterprises and encourage entrepreneurship.  The Agri-food sector was identified in the Departments analyses as being particularly exposed to Brexit.  The introduction of an income averaging "step-out" in the agriculture sector will help with the volatility Brexit may bring.  In addition to this a &euro;150 million loan fund will be provided jointly by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and EU exceptional adjustment aid to enable farmers to better manage their cash flow and reduce the cost of borrowing.</p>  <p>  At a macroeconomic level Budget 2017 sought to build up Ireland's buffers to any fallout from Brexit.  Accordingly the Government has decided to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 percent to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth.  This will improve Ireland's ability to absorb a shock in addition to the rainy day fund announced in the Summer Economic Statement.</p></reply>

On 12th July 2016, the CSO released updated National Income and Expenditure (NIE) Accounts for 2015 which included a very significant upward revision in Ireland's GNI for 2015.  As mentioned above, GNI is an important input into the calculation of Ireland's EU Budget contributions, representing c.75% of our total contributions.</p>  <p>  Our initial estimate for the impact of the CSO revision on our EU Budget contribution for 2017 was c. &euro;280m when allowing for all factors.  However, given the recent revisions to Irish GNI for 2017 announced at the time of Budget 2017, the final figure may be lower.  The final impact of the contribution is dependent on a number of variables, including the size of the overall EU budget for 2017, GNI movements in other Member States and other EU budget operational developments.</p>  <p>  As published in Budget 2017, we currently forecast that Ireland will make a contribution of &euro;2,400m to the EU budget in 2017.

The European Banking Authority is an important part of the European System of Financial Supervision that arose after the financial crisis.  None of the micro- or macro-prudential supervision entities that are part of this system is based in Ireland and there are no senior executives from Ireland heading any of these organisations.</p>  <p>  This was the first stage in letting the wider financial community know that Ireland wants to be considered as a host in the relocation process.  This decision was taken due to the fact Ireland has a significant financial services sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity to absorb the European Banking Authority's re-location to Ireland.  Also our interest in hosting the European Banking Authority demonstrates the continued importance Ireland places in well regulated Financial Services and it has sent a signal to the global financial sector of the importance that Ireland places on the financial services sector.</p>  <p>  Post the Government decision my officials will now engage with relevant stakeholders, to further progress the goal of relocating the European Banking Authority to Ireland post the completion of the negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom.  These meetings will include the European Banking Authority and European Commission in order to highlight the benefits of relocating the Authority to Ireland, such as the fact that Ireland would be a less disruptive relocation destination for the authority and its staff due to its close proximity to London, both geographically and culturally.  These meetings will also aim to determine the needs of the European Banking Authority and its staff.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that the process for relocating the European Banking Authority will be not be quick as it will be linked to the triggering of Article 50 by the UK and subsequent negotiations between it and the European Union.</p></reply>

This wider report was agreed by Government and published on the Office of Public Works website this week.</p><p>In the review, my Department examined a number of other jurisdictions and concluded that policy surrounding the availability of flood insurance falls, broadly, into three categories:</p><p>(i) <b>Insurance Pool with State Indemnification:</b>Such an arrangement would be financed by an agreed percentage of premiums on all policyholders.  This option would lead to additional levies being imposed on household insurance policies at a time of increasing insurance costs, and could potentially lead to a considerable financial exposure to the State in the form of a State backstop.</p><p>(ii) <b>Compulsory flood insurance:</b>The conclusion was that this model would have a  limited impact on the availability of flood insurance unless pricing could be controlled.  However, the State and the regulator are expressly prohibited in EU law (Solvency II) from any attempt to limit the industry in terms of pricing.  This option also carried the risk of some insurance undertakings leaving the Irish market.</p><p>(iii) <b>Private Sector provision of flood insurance which is the current approach with targeted State compensation after flood events:</b>The recommendation of this option is based on clear evidence that this strategy is working as demonstrated by an incremental increase in the provision of flood insurance in areas protected by flood defences.  When compared with the other two options, it remains the best approach in terms of its responsiveness and effectiveness.  My Department's report recommended that the current approach be enhanced by strengthening the arrangements for data sharing between OPW and Insurance Ireland, as well as obtaining additional levels of data on the availability of flood insurance through detailed surveys.  The strengthening of the interaction between Insurance Ireland and the OPW has already commenced as demonstrated by the commitment by Insurance Ireland in July 2016 to assess the risk from the use of demountable flood defences as well as an agreement to hold quarterly meetings.</p></reply>

He also pointed out that these breaches are not large enough to bring fines.</p>  <p>  Taking each of these in turn, I and my Department have frequently highlighed that the harmonised methodolgy used to calculate the structural balance is not suitable for a small open economy.  In Budget 2016, the forecast nominal general government deficit was about &euro;2.8 billion.  The forecast for 2016 in Budget 2017 is for a deficit of &euro;2.4 billion.  Although the forecast structural deficit also changed down from 2.5% of GDP to 1.9%, the improvement was reduced to 0.3 per cent from 0.8 per cent because the forecast outturn for 2015 of minus 3.2% turned into an outturn of 2.2% of GDP.  This is one reason why our fiscal planning looks to the expenditure benchmark in the first instance.</p>  <p>  The &euro;200 million excess over permitted expenditure under the benchmark in 2017 is due to the projected increase in our EU Budget contribution arising from the large revision in our GDP.  As this is a factor beyond our control, the Government has decided not to alter its fiscal plans to cope with a one-off level shift in our EU contribution.  It should be noted that the European Commission applies an overall assessment encompassing performance against both rules when assessing compliance.  Accordingly, we expect that the European Commission will find that Ireland is broadly compliant with its obligation - indeed, I would point out that Ireland is one of the countries that the European Commission has not written to seeking clarification or changes.</p>  <p>  I do not agree that the fiscal rules are overly restrictive.  They are designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth. Given our comparably high debt level and the fact that we are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual,  it makes sense to get to a balanced budget in structural terms as planned in 2018.  By reducing our debt to much lower levels, we will increase our capacity to withstand shocks by building our capacity to borrow.  The fiscal rules underpin and facilitate achieving this objective.</p></reply>

As the tax revenue performance was strong at end-May, with receipts some &euro;774 million above profile, and up &euro;1,549 million in year on year terms   forecast tax receipts for 2016 were increased by c. &euro;900 million in the Summer Economic Statement to &euro;48.1 billion. This forecast was not adjusted in Budget 2017, as taxes remain on track to meet this target.</p>  <p>  The Expenditure Report 2017 forecasts a 2016 outturn of &euro;51.9 billion for current spending and &euro;4.2 billion for capital spending. This reflects the provision of an additional &euro;850 million in resources compared to the Estimates published in December 2015.  </p>  <p>  The Summer Economic Statement and the Mid-Year Expenditure Report set out increases of an additional &euro;500 million for the Department of Health to deal with spending pressures in relation to health and social care and &euro;40 million for the Garda Vote to support an intensified police response to the recent spate of serious crime related violence in Dublin.  </p>  <p>  Subsequently, as part of Budget 2017, a further &euro;310 million was included for 2016. This consists of &euro;200 million of capital funding for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year and capital payments for school building works. This was also signalled in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report. Separately, a further &euro;110 million was provided to meet current expenditure demands.</p>  <p>  With 10 months of the year gone, &euro;36.7 billion has been collected in tax revenue, 1.7 per cent or &euro;613 million ahead of the original target and up 4.7 per cent or &euro;1,651 million on the same period last year. This leaves &euro;11.4 billion, or almost one quarter of the annual tax target, to be collected during November and December this year. Almost two thirds of these receipts are due under the categories of corporation tax and income tax, both of which have demonstrated robust year-on-year growth in the first 10 months of this year. </p>  <p>  The achievement of this target is necessary to fund overall gross voted expenditure of &euro;56.1 billion in 2016. Any shortfall in tax revenue could jeopardise our 2016 general government deficit target of 0.9 per cent of GDP, which in turn would have implications for the structural deficit and the projected borrowings required to fund this increased expenditure.</p></reply>

A number of other bodies also have a role in this area which ensures that a robust consumer protection framework for financial products and services is in place. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank's mission statement is "safeguarding stability, protecting consumers". The Central Bank, in its Annual Report, Annual Performance Statement and Consumer Protection Outlook Report, sets out in a comprehensive how it delivers on its consumer protection mandate.  The Central Bank has also reviewed and updated a number of its codes in this area including; the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises, in order to ensure the consumer protection framework remains effective.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has a broad mandate, with statutory responsibility for the enforcement of competition and consumer protection law. The CCPC also has a specific role under legislation to provide personal finance information and education to consumers. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau provides for independent, impartial investigation and resolution of disputes between consumers and financial service providers and the services of the Ombudsman are free to the complainant.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Consumer Protection Framework for consumers of financial services has undergone significant changes on both a domestic and European level over recent years. </p>  <p>  By way of example, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015. It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity. </p>  <p>  In the area of residential mortgages, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (SI 142/16) have transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law. This Directive provides that certain minimum consumer information and protection measures   such as the provision of standardised pre-contractual information, common requirements for the calculation of the APRC, the requirement on a lender to conduct a credit worthiness assessment prior to offering mortgage credit   are to apply across the EU. </p>  <p>  In September of this year, the Payment Accounts Directive came into effect in Ireland. The Directive introduces new rules in relation to transparency and the comparability of fees connected to payment accounts, switching from one payment account provider to another and accessing payment accounts. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, changes in this area continue to take place. For example, the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) is due to be transposed by January 2018. PSD2 aims to further develop the aims of the first Payment Services Directive (PSD1) by regulating new market players, enhancing consumer protection and ensuring competition within the industry whilst maintaining a level playing field, and harmonising the regulations across Europe. </p></reply>

Whilst a major objective of any such funding vehicle is to leverage additionality in terms of social housing supply, it is envisaged that a substantial portion of the overall supply of new units may need to be for private housing to meet the commerciality test and to satisfy the requirements of an off-balance sheet investment model.    </p>  <p>  It should be noted that several proposals from private sector residential investors and developers have not proven to be either commercial or likely to pass the requirements for an off-balance sheet model. As outlined in Rebuilding Ireland, the ISIF and the wider NTMA has identified that such a funding vehicle has the potential to provide some 5,000 additional units over a five-year period for social housing and could also play an important role in activating residential construction for the broader build to rent sector.  </p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement on the ISIF supported Housing Fund set out in Rebuilding Ireland, involving input from a wide array of actors, including my Department, ISIF/NTMA, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, CSO/Eurostat, the European Investment Bank and other actors.  To date, there have been a series of meetings between these actors at which useful clarifications were received from CSO/Eurostat and the European Investment Bank.  </p>  <p>  These meetings have allowed for detailed work to begin on the design of a funding vehicle. The actual establishment, management and operations of such a funding vehicle will require significant time, investment and engagement from a wide array of stakeholders in the public and private sectors and will only be possible if the challenges of establishing commerciality and off-balance sheet treatment can be satisfactorily met.  </p></reply>

In summary, the Department's submission recognises the overall importance of macro prudential controls on the extension of credit for housing purposes but it also suggested that it would be appropriate at this time to make some adjustment to the existing measures to have regard to, in particular, the position of first time buyers; for example, it asks the Central Bank to consider the adoption of a "capacity to pay" test (e.g. the payment capacity of potential purchasers based on rent paid over a five year period to be off set against the current deposit rules), an increase in the allowance for lending for primary dwelling mortgages in excess of the LTV and LTI caps to 20% and 25% respectively and that the first time buyer LTV limit of 90 per cent be applicable to the first &euro;320,000 value of a property (compared to the current limit of &euro;220,000).   It is expected that the Central Bank will shortly report on the outcome of its review.</p>  <p>  Separately, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government also provided for a "Help to Buy" scheme in the recent Budget and this was discussed with the Central Bank to ensure that the rebate under the scheme would qualify in meeting the deposit requirement for first time buyers under the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.</p></reply>

The lease payments are not subject to VAT in Ireland. If the customer is established in another EU Member State the VAT position will be determined by reference to the law in that country. If the customer is established outside the EU the lease payments are outside the scope of VAT. </p><p>The number of companies and VAT payments by the aircraft leasing industry for the years requested are as shown in the following table.  I am advised that the figures are based on the industry description (NACE code) assigned to businesses on the Revenue taxpayer register. </p><p>The statistics in the VAT column of the table are net figures for all VAT paid and repaid to the aircraft leasing industry. The figures are negative as the aircraft leasing sector is generally in a net repayment position in respect of VAT for each year.  This is because, as VAT registered businesses, they are entitled to claim VAT on their inputs, but would not generally charge VAT on their outputs as the majority of their supplies are made to customers outside the State and, therefore, are not subject to Irish VAT.</p><p>With regard to the number of companies that benefit from the 13.5% VAT rate that applies to short term hiring of transport, including aircraft, and the VAT foregone on not charging the 23% standard VAT rate to these services, this information is not available. Information on the number of aircraft leasing companies that have benefitted from 0% VAT as a result of leasing to international airlines is also not available.  In relation to the VAT foregone on new means of transport, I would point out that the 13.5% reduced VAT rate charged on the hire of new means of transport is only of benefit to businesses supplying hire of transport within the State, such as businesses hiring cars. As aircraft businesses for the most part make supplies to customers outside the State, the 13.5% VAT rate is not of benefit to them.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Companies</th><th>VAT</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Number</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,580</td><td>-19</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,754</td><td>-21</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2,021</td><td>-17</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2,284</td><td>-15</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (provisional)</td><td>2,597</td><td>-26</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Whilst a major objective of any such funding vehicle is to leverage additionality in terms of social housing supply, it is envisaged that a substantial portion of the overall supply of new units may need to be for private housing to meet the commerciality test and to satisfy the requirements of an off-balance sheet investment model.    </p>  <p>  It should be noted that several proposals from private sector residential investors and developers have not proven to be either commercial or likely to pass the requirements for an off-balance sheet model. As outlined in Rebuilding Ireland, the ISIF and the wider NTMA has identified that such a funding vehicle has the potential to provide some 5,000 additional units over a five-year period for social housing and could also play an important role in activating residential construction for the broader build to rent sector.  </p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement on the ISIF supported Housing Fund set out in Rebuilding Ireland, involving input from a wide array of actors, including my Department, ISIF/NTMA, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, CSO/Eurostat, the European Investment Bank and other actors.  To date, there have been a series of meetings between these actors at which useful clarifications were received from CSO/Eurostat and the European Investment Bank.  </p>  <p>  These meetings have allowed for detailed work to begin on the design of a funding vehicle. The actual establishment, management and operations of such a funding vehicle will require significant time, investment and engagement from a wide array of stakeholders in the public and private sectors and will only be possible if the challenges of establishing commerciality and off-balance sheet treatment can be satisfactorily met.</p></reply>

Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA's website and which are managed by the appointed receivers/administrators, properties continue to be managed by their existing owners.  </p>  <p>  The property referred to in the newspaper article referenced by the Deputy is under the management of a Statutory Receiver.  The Receiver is managing the sale of the property in accordance with NAMA's guidelines on open marketing and his own statutory and fiduciary obligations to maximise the sales price achieved for the property.  The Statutory Receiver appointed the sales agent and,  in conjunction with the sales agent, determined the marketing strategy for the property.  It is standard market practice for a seller to include information on current and future potential rental levels.  </p>  <p>  In its capacity as a secured lender, it is NAMA's policy that, where possible, borrowers and receivers should avoid seeking vacant possession of residential property in advance of asset sales in order to minimise disruption to people living in these homes.  Tenants of such properties continue to have the benefit of existing lease terms and of the statutory protections in place in the residential rental market.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately, decisions about the timing and strategy of any sale are a matter for the NAMA Board in accordance with its statutory independent commercial mandate.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the wider market issues raised by the Deputy, I would point out that NAMA is making, on a commercial basis, a very substantial contribution to the increased supply of new homes through its residential delivery programme.  As the Deputy will be aware, NAMA has outlined that a key commercial objective is to facilitate the funding of 20,000 new residential units, mainly in the greater Dublin area, by the end of 2020 and it is making substantial progress towards achieving this target. NAMA has also delivered 2,300 residential units for social housing purposes to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies thereby making a significant contribution.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) that its shareholdings with fossil fuel exposure includes certain investments inherited from its predecessor the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF).</p>  <p>  These shareholdings are in companies based outside Ireland and, as such, are held in ISIF's global portfolio. The global portfolio has been restructured and is being sold over time to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise, in keeping with ISIF's mandate to invest, on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment, in Ireland. ISIF's total equity holdings in the Energy sector are valued at &euro;11 million (0.14% of ISIF's assets under management). ISIF has also invested in circa. &euro;97 million of short term fixed income investments in energy corporations, representing just over 1% of ISIF's assets.</p>  <p>  Such investments should be considered in the context of ISIF's Irish portfolio and its significant commitment to renewables. ISIF's investment strategy is aligned with Government policy and the State's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy. ISIF recently published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy and this emphasises climate change as part of the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into its investment decision making. </p>  <p>  Many major funds internationally have made significant divestments from fossil fuels such as coal, while other such funds have adopted an approach of engagement with energy companies to establish their strategy and positioning for the transition to a low carbon economy.  ISIF continually reviews its carbon exposure and the investment case for companies that may not be aligned with the long term transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, which established ISIF on a statutory basis provides that ISIF shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation and that in reviewing its investment strategy shall consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I am advised by ISIF that this review will be completed during the 4th quarter of 2016.</p></reply>

Revenue's work in relation to offshore accounts and other financial product investigations has to date resulted in the recovery of &euro;2.8 billion in tax, interest and penalties.</p>  <p>  In line with their active approach to identifying and confronting those who try to escape their tax responsibilities, Revenue  has advised me also they are examining the information that has become available through the "Panama Papers" revelations, and, in addition, that they have requested access to any elements of that documentation that could be of relevance to their work against tax evasion and avoidance.  They are committed to making the fullest possible use of any available information in pursuing cases where it appears that tax liabilities have not been addressed. </p>  <p>  Revenue continues to engage fully with the OECD Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) Network to agree concrete actions that tax administrations can take in response to evidence of tax avoidance and evasion, and leading to a multilateral and coordinated approach to the "Panama Papers" data.  Effective cooperation of this kind between countries is essential in tackling this worldwide problem, if the international community is to succeed in ensuring that there will be no hiding places for those who seek to escape their tax obligations.</p>  <p>  I fully support the widespread move towards increased global financial and tax transparency, and Revenue is at the forefront of international developments for Automatic Exchange of Information.  Key developments in this field are the OECD's Common Reporting Standard, the EU's Directives on Administrative Cooperation and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Initiative.  Revenue has advised me that they are considering carefully how to make the best possible use of all data sources of this kind to identify any cases of tax evasion by Irish residents using offshore accounts or structures.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting any legislative changes that that are needed to tackle tax evasion using offshore structures or accounts and have, for that reason, proposed in the Finance Bill 2016 a measure that would, as and from 1 May 2017, eliminate any possibility of a qualifying disclosure in cases of that kind.  Anybody who has tax liabilities relating to offshore matters and who does not act now to address them will, if the proposal is enacted, face the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible prosecution.</p></reply>

Given our comparably high debt level and the fact that we are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual, it makes sense to get to a balanced budget in structural terms as planned in 2018.  By reducing our debt to much lower levels, we will increase our capacity to withstand shocks by building our capacity to borrow.  The fiscal rules underpin and facilitate achieving this objective.</p>  <p>  As the harmonised methodology used to calculate the structural balance is not always suitable for a small open economy, our fiscal planning looks to the expenditure benchmark in the first instance.  My Department's forecast of general government expenditure in 2016 will comfortably comply with the permitted expenditure limit under this rule.</p>  <p>  My Department's forecasts of general government expenditure in Budget 2017 is some &euro;200 million in excess of the permitted expenditure under the benchmark.  This  is due to the projected increase in our EU Budget contribution arising from the large revision in our GDP.  However as we are forecast to make sufficient progress towards a balanced budget in structural terms in 2017 and the EU Budget contribution is a factor beyond our control, the Government has decided not to alter its fiscal plans in light of this one-off level shift. </p>  <p>  In line with European requirements, Ireland's draft budgetary plan for 2017 was submitted on the 17th of October 2016.  It is now undergoing assessment by the European Commission, which is expected to issue its opinion in mid-November.  The European Commission applies an overall assessment  encompassing performance against both the balanced budget rule and the expenditure benchmark when assessing compliance.  Accordingly, we expect that the European Commission will find that Ireland is broadly compliant with its obligation - indeed, I would point out that Ireland is not one of the seven countries that the European Commission has written to seeking clarification about or changes in their draft budgetary plans.</p></reply>

A straightforward analysis of the Help to Buy scheme in isolation might suggest that it would increase prices, but this does not take on board the other impacts on the housing market that will arise as a result of the 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness', which was launched last July.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy scheme should be considered.  Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the Help-to-Buy scheme on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.</p></reply>

This measure will enable farmers to improve the management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of their short-term borrowings so they can continue to trade during the current period of commodity price volatility.</p>  <p>  The government is committed to supporting the wider financing needs of SMEs, in all sectors of the economy, and ensuring that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was established to increase and facilitate the availability of low cost, flexible credit to SMEs.  In this regard, it is encouraging to note that to the end of June 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;347 million to 8,619 SMEs.  On average, the SBCI provides a discount of circa 1.5% on the market interest rate to SMEs.</p>  <p>  The SBCI continues to have significant lending capacity; it has funding agreements in place with the European Investment Bank, KfW and the NTMA and has a current funding capacity of over &euro;1 billion to enable it to make low cost loans available to SMEs across all qualifying sectors. </p>  <p>  The most recent Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey sought the reasons why businesses did not seek credit and the results showed that 84% of respondents who had not applied for credit stated that they did not seek credit because they did not need it. </p>  <p>  The deputy should note that this particular agriculture measure is only possible due to exceptional EU aid for the sector and it relates to issues that are specific to the agri-sector at present and consequently, it is a specific and time bound initiative.  The SBCI will continue to be the central mechanism for providing SMEs with access to low cost financing products from a range of bank and non-bank lenders.</p></reply>

However, they have made enquiries and the centre appears to have opened in May 2016 and it accommodates some migrants as well as serving as a "drop-in" centre offering a range of general activities and supports.  There are a large number of migrant facilities in Athens.  Irish officials do not visit shelters as this is not the process for relocation agreed with the Greek Asylum Service or the mechanism set out in the relevant legal instruments.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the mechanism for relocating asylum seekers from Greece to Ireland is set out in Council Decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1604 which establish provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and of Greece.  According to Article 3(2) of the Council Decisions on relocation, relocation shall be applied only in respect of an applicant belonging to a nationality for which the proportion of decisions granting international protection among decisions taken at first instance on application for international protection as referred to in the Asylum Procedures Directive (Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection) is, according to the latest available updated quarterly EU-wide average Eurostat data, 75% or higher.</p>  <p>  At the moment, under the established mechanisms, the main beneficiaries in Greece of the relocation programme are Syrians and Iraqis.  Iraqis are no longer on the list of eligible nationalities for relocation since the beginning of July having fallen below the 75% threshold.  However, those who registered before that deadline and applied to be relocated remain eligible for relocation.  These nationalities are a sub-set of the overall pool of migrants and asylum seekers in Greece.</p>  <p>  The process for relocation is that following receipt by Greece of a pledge from Ireland to consider accepting a given number of asylum seekers under relocation, the Greek Asylum Service forwards the files of asylum seekers from nationalities eligible for relocation who have registered with the Greek Asylum Service and indicated a willingness to participate in the relocation programme.  In order to become eligible for the relocation programme, an applicant would first have to apply for international protection and they must go through the identification, registration and fingerprinting procedure carried out by the Greek authorities.  Applicants must opt into the relocation programme; they must be from nationalities eligible for relocation and while they do not have a choice as to specific country they are sent to under relocation, efforts are made by the Greek Asylum Service to "match" them with a suitable country, including one for which they may have indicated a preference during their interview.</p>  <p>  Ireland has submitted a schedule of pledges to Greece which covers all asylum seekers due to be relocated to Ireland under the Council Decisions.  The purpose in doing this is to allow the Greek Asylum Service to project manage the pledges made by Ireland and fit them into their schedule of pledges from numerous Member States.  This process is working well and Ireland has programmed pledges to September 2017 in respect of our full allocation under the relevant Council Decisions.</p>  <p>  Irish IRPP officials working on the ground in Athens, both from my Department and from other agencies, undertake vulnerability assessment interviews with approved applicants, conduct security screening (in the case of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) with those applicants, liaise with unaccompanied minors (in the case of Tusla officials), and undertake other activities relevant to the management of the pledges and the needs of asylum seekers eligible for relocation.  There is a clear process in place for the relocation of asylum seekers and that process is made known to all those eligible for relocation.  The Greek Asylum Service and related agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration and UNHCR are responsible for managing this process and Ireland devotes its resources on the grounds in Athens to working with bodies like these in order to ensure that we meet the needs of the asylum seekers that are due to be relocated to Ireland.  That process is now working well.</p></reply>

The result of this work was a roadmap to ratification, which was published on 21 October 2015 and which outlines the considerable legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, along with the estimated deadline of end-2016 for ratification.  The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department's website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  Since publication of the Roadmap, work has continued on a bilateral basis between my Department and the other relevant Departments to progress each of the specific issues identified. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland's ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced its second stage reading in the D&aacute;il on 5 October.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.  I expect to publish the Bill shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention by end-2016.</p></reply>

The case concerns an appeal taken by the State against a judgement of the High Court ordering the release of the three named prisoners who had been transferred to Ireland from the UK where they had been sentenced, under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Acts, 1995-1997.</p>  <p>  The judgement is detailed and has implications for the continuance in its present form of the process operated by the Irish Prison Service for transferring prisoners from other States to Ireland, and vice versa.  The practical effect of this judgement and whether it will necessitate legislative and/or administrative changes is being examined by officials of the Irish Prison Service and my Department in consultation with Attorney General.  Pending legal clarity on these issues, applications by prisoners abroad for transfer to Ireland cannot be processed to a conclusion at present.  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that all applicants and officials in the appropriate sentencing states are being informed of this position.  Given the complex nature of the review being undertaken, it is not possible at this stage to indicate a time frame for its conclusion. </p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors, including crime trends, demographics and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure that optimal use is made of Garda resources.</p>  <p>  The area mentioned by the Deputy is patrolled by members assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Central Division.  I have been informed that as of the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 604 Garda&iacute; assigned to the (DMR) North Central.  For operational reasons it is not appropriate for me to comment on the strength of the detective units operating in the Division. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  The Government approved some &euro;55 million to maintain the necessary policing response to tackle gangland and associated crime.  This funding provides for:</p>  <p>  - concentrated policing targeting gang related crime;</p>  <p>  - the continued intensive and strategic targeting of burglaries and related crime through ongoing support for Operation Thor; and</p>  <p>  - continued support for measures against terrorism.</p>  <p>  Funding was also approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region given the identified need to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  The Dublin Armed Support Unit is, as a matter of priority, in the process of being set up, following a selection process training has commenced and it expected that the unit will be operational next month.  Steps are also being taken to ensure that the Unit is fully equipped and to upgrade the equipment available to the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public safety concerns about community safety.  As of 4 September 2016, there have been 38 arrests and 5 charges brought in connection with the recent shootings.  In addition, 23 firearms have been seized and over 9,000 lines of enquiry conducted.  In excess of 11,520 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p>  <p>  For 2017, I have secured a further &euro;71.5 million for Garda overtime which will facilitate the continuation of large scale policing operations including those targeting gangland crime and burglary.</p>  <p>  Underpinning the measures outlined above is the Government&rsquo;s intention to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.  While in the short term substantial funds are being made available for overtime, measures are in train to accelerate the planned Garda recruitment programme, along with the recruitment of further civilian and specialist staff.  In 2017 an extra 800 Gardai will be recruited as well as 500 civilian staff to ensure that the service is renewed and has the capacity to provide visible, responsive and effective policing to every community throughout the country.</p></reply>

However, it is not fully clear as to which part of the tax code as it relates to incapacitated individuals, the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy incentive, as proposed, will provide for a refund of income tax, including DIRT, paid in any or all of the 4 tax years preceding the year in which an individual makes an application under the incentive.  This refund will be used to help fund the purchase or construction of a new house or apartment.</p>  <p>  An individual who otherwise satisfies the conditions necessary to avail of Help to Buy will not be precluded from making a claim for the relief, as a consequence of having availed of a refund of DIRT under Section 267.  However, any amounts of DIRT already refunded under section 267 will not be available for inclusion in the Help to Buy amount, but if such an individual has paid sufficient income tax in the relevant four years he or she may be still in a position to avail of the maximum amount of relief available under the Help to Buy scheme. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, the Deputy could be referring to section 465 of the TCA, with regard to the incapacitated child tax credit.  In this case, the Deputy should be aware that if such an individual has paid sufficient income tax (including DIRT) in the relevant four years, after deductions and credits (including the incapacitated child tax credit), he or she may be in a position to avail of the maximum amount available under Help to Buy.</p>  <p>  As a general rule, individuals cannot reclaim more income tax than they have paid through the cumulative use of various tax relief and credits.

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'. Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p>  <p>  Under the  Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expect that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.  No such instances have as yet been brought to the attention of the Department.</p>  <p>  Finally I would highlight that landlord-tenant relations are governed by multiple pieces of legislation mainly under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

In line with its statutory mandate, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is examining opportunities to make, on a commercial basis, strategic investments that have the potential to support increased social and affordable housing output.  </p><p>In the private market, the Fund is already involved in a number of important initiatives which cumulatively can make a contribution to increased housing output.  This includes its investments in:</p><p><b>- Activate Capital</b>- which is an innovative non-bank financing platform that has the potential to provide funding for substantial numbers of new homes in Dublin and the other major urban centres in which demand is most pronounced;</p><p><b>- Ardstone Residential Partnership</b>- which is a residential equity investment fund that is focused on delivering residential units to the market over the short-to medium-term and</p><p><b>- Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund</b>- which has funded a number of residential developments in recent months.  </p><p>Activate Capital, which has the potential to fund the delivery of up to 11,000 new housing units over the medium term, has already advanced funding for the construction of 1,200 new houses in the greater Dublin area, the first of which will come to the market in the next month or so.  The Ardstone Fund has to-date acquired sites with the potential to deliver up to 1,800 new housing units which will be delivered over a 5-7 years' time frame and it is targeting a total delivery of up to 3,000 new units.  The Wilbur Ross Cardinal Fund, which has a focus on multiple real estate sectors, providing both pure finance and development capital, has already advanced funding for 1,700 new residential units.</p><p>In the social and affordable market, in line with Rebuilding Ireland's commitment, the NTMA and the key Government Departments are examining the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle in conjunction with the private sector, which could facilitate investment in social and affordable housing. Key factors which must be addressed to facilitate ISIF involvement in such projects include:</p><p>1. the commercial viability of the vehicle; and</p><p>2. the off-balance sheet structure of the vehicle.</p><p>ISIF informs me that whilst it has made progress in conjunction with other stakeholders in the State and private sectors in respect of potential social housing investment opportunities, there are still considerable hurdles to be overcome before any such proposals can be brought to a successful conclusion.  These include the hurdles of commerciality and balance sheet treatment identified above and in Rebuilding Ireland.  The Deputy will appreciate that whilst ISIF is working closely with all relevant stakeholders to help overcome hurdles to investment in social and affordable housing, many of these hurdles are outside the control of ISIF and require strong inputs from other stakeholders.  </p><p>In relation to interest rates charged by ISIF, ISIF invests on a risk adjusted basis.  In this context, the interest rates applied by ISIF to any given investment relates to the level of risk and other investment criteria, including pricing, and reflects its mandate to act commercially and in a way that contributes to the local economy. </p><p>A review of ISIF's investment strategy, due to take place after 18 months from the time of ISIF's establishment, is underway.  The review will include an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to date.  I am informed by ISIF that preparatory work in respect of this review has commenced and is due to be completed by end-2016.  The NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 provides that ownership of the Fund vests with the Minister for Finance.  It also provides that the Fund shall, in reviewing its investment strategy, consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The review of the ISIF will be conducted in accordance with these provisions. In addition, the legislation provides that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers as appropriate.</p></reply>

In this statement, I also highlighted the lack of transparency and predictability that currently characterise the rules.  Fiscal rules have become extremely complex and difficult to communicate publicly. Moreover, predictability as to how compliance assessment will be performed is lacking. </p>  <p>  I emphasised that although both democratic and political ownership of the fiscal rules in Ireland is strong, a robust defence of the benefit of such rules is becoming progressively more difficult, in particular where the perception arises that rules are being applied differently for small and large Member States.  It is essential that these rules are applied fairly and in a sensible and predictable manner. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my fellow Finance Ministers and I are of a shared view that a certain degree of flexibility within the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact is both necessary and should be permitted in certain limited circumstances to better align with country-specific economic circumstances and investment needs.  Whilst recent reforms on flexibility within the rules are welcome, work needs to continue in this area.</p></reply>

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including the commissioning of an ESRI study published in November 2015, and ongoing liaison with the Central Bank.  This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Following the results of the UK referendum, this preparatory work has been intensified across the Department.  A new Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.  Resourcing for Brexit is being kept under review.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit.  The Department also published 'Getting Ireland Brexit ready' which set out a number of measures to mitigate the initial impacts of Brexit. In addition, the Department published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy.  More recently, the Department has worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report titled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published on 7 November 2016. </p>  <p>  The work being done by the Department will be an important input to ensuring that Ireland's interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.  More generally, the Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context.  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, Budget 2017 signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer.</p>  <p>  In relation to Financial Services, Minister of State Murphy T.D. has responsibility, and will continue to drive forward the IFS 2020 strategy in order to build on and compete for mobile international investment in the IFS sector.  Additionally, the Government has made a public declaration of interest for the relocation of the European Banking Authority to Ireland. </p></reply>

It is my intention to continue the process of reducing the USC in future Budgets, and the Deputy will be aware that this is not a measure that I have considered in isolation, but as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan.  </p>  <p>  Further to a commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department published, in July this year, a detailed overview of the policy considerations relevant to this reform, including the necessity to maintain the breadth of our income tax base, and retain appropriate levels of taxation for high earners.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this Income Tax Reform Plan was to inform all members of the Oireachtas of the issues and options which will underpin future income tax reform, and it is my hope that all members of the Oireachtas will engage constructively in debating options for future reform in this area.  In this regard the scope for change will be dependent on the level of available fiscal resources.</p>  <p>  In relation to the commitments in the Programme for Government, the Deputy will be aware that there is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the Earned Income Credit (EIC) to &euro;1,650, and the Budget 2017 increase of &euro;400 to the existing &euro;550 credit introduced last year is a significant step in this direction.  This is available to self-employed individuals who have an active trade or profession, and who do not have access to the PAYE credit.  This will be a significant benefit to small business-owners right across the country including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.  The Programme for Government also committed to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed, and the Deputy will be aware that my colleague Minister Varadkar has announced a number of enhancements to the social protection benefits available to self-employed individuals.</p>  <p>  I accept that differences remain between the taxation of employees and the self-employed.  However it must also be acknowledged that some of these differences are to the benefit of the self-employed.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  The self-employed also continue to benefit from a broader expense deduction regime than that available to employees.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the taxation of the self-employed is considered in some detail in the Income Tax Reform Plan, and the issues outlined therein will be borne in mind when deciding future reform of the income tax system as it relates to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  With regard to other income tax commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government, these included a commitment to support parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children, through an increase in the Home Carer Credit.  In Budget 2017, I have provided for a &euro;100 increase in the Home Carer Credit, bringing it to a value of &euro;1,100.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Programme also committed to explore mechanisms through which SMEs can reward key employees with share options in a tax-efficient manner.  My Department held a public consultation on his subject earlier this year to which over 30 submissions were received and considered by my officials.  In Budget 2017 I announced my intention to introduce a new, SME-focussed, share-based incentive scheme, to be introduced in Budget 2018.  Such an incentive will require the approval of the European Commission and my officials will commence engagement with the Commission to ensure that the incentive will comply with State Aid rules in advance of the next Budget.</p></reply>

The levy is charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raises approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year does not exceed &euro;100,000, the levy is not payable.</p>  <p>  In last year's budget statement I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the levy.</p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department earlier this year.  Following that review, I have decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.  I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect.  Firstly, it ensures that financial institutions entering the market over the five further years for which the levy will apply will be subject to the levy and financial institutions exiting the market will cease to be subject to the levy. Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, I have to increase the rate at which the levy is charged from 35% to 59% for 2017.  This is because the assessable amount, DIRT payments in 2015, have reduced significantly since 2011.  This new rate, combined with the new 2015 base year, will preserve the existing contribution of &euro;150 million paid by the affected financial institutions.  That rate will be subject to an annual review to ensure that the yield from the levy is not impacted from changes in interest rates and/or DIRT rates.  </p></reply>

This shareholding is a valuable asset to the State and it is the Government's intention that the State will exit this and our other banking investments in a measured and careful manner.  My primary objective in the disposal of those assets will be recovering the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer.</p>  <p>   I have indicated in the past that an IPO is likely to be the optimal route to recouping value from our investment in AIB.  At the beginning of this year officials in my Department appointed an independent financial adviser, following a tender process, to assist with analysis and exit planning and much of the initial preparation has now been completed.  The bank's CEO also indicated recently that much of the internal preparation that would be required in advance of launching an IPO process has also been completed.  In addition, I welcome the bank's continued strong performance, demonstrating sustainable profitability and strong capital generation over a number of consecutive reporting periods. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, given the complex nature of an IPO process, the need to access certain IPO "windows" and the recent volatility seen in stock markets, we are now looking at 2017 for any disposal rather than this year.  Fortunately given the strong state of the economy, progress made in reducing our national debt and positive market sentiment towards Ireland, we are not under any pressure to sell our shares and hence we can choose when to time any disposal.  Clearly, in order for us to proceed with an IPO, we would need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the business, bearing in mind its current performance and future prospects.  As you will appreciate a lot of preparatory work is involved in such a process and officials in my Department continue to plan such that when conditions do improve the State is ready to execute.</p>  <p>  It would not be possible or prudent for me to estimate the amount which might be received from any future sale of shares in AIB.  As the Deputy may be aware, the shares in AIB that are currently freely held amount to only a tiny proportion of the bank's total shares.  It is therefore an illiquid share with a distorted valuation, and so cannot be considered a valid indicator of how the market would value AIB in an IPO.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, all capital returned from the State's investments in the Irish banks will be used to reduce the national debt.  That is the prudent course of action as it reduces our ongoing borrowing costs and ensures the future strength and stability of the economy.</p></reply>

As previously noted by both my own Department and the Fiscal Advisory Council, the Commonly Agreed Methodology (CAM) for estimating potential output is subject to limitations particularly when applied to Ireland.  My Department continues to assess the merit of alternative models for estimating potential output for Ireland. Considerable work has been undertaken on this front to assess both the plausibility and importantly the stability of these alternative estimates.  An outline of this work is set out in Box1, page 24 of the Stability Programme Update 2016 (SPU), published in April.  This work was further updated in the slides presented to the Budget Oversight Committee and to IFAC.  Whilst the intention has been to publish this technical work revisions to national accounts data and data limitations in respect of the underlying current account have delayed this. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the advance of alternatives models, for the purposes of assessing the cyclical position of the economy in the context of fiscal monitoring, the CAM remains the relevant legally binding metric.  In addition to developing alternative models efforts continue to be undertaken at technical level in Europe to improve the performance of the CAM, to which Ireland continues to actively contribute. </p>  <p>  In addition to these models, when assessing the cyclical position of the economy, my Department takes into consideration a wide range of other indicators beyond those considered as part of the CAM.  My Department will remain vigilant to signs of overheating and the government will continue to pursue sensible policies aimed at ensuring sustainable growth and public finances. </p></reply>

As such I do not expect to make any new appointments of Public Interest Directors to the board of the banks.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the rights for the State to appoint public interest directors to the boards of the covered institutions were derived from the terms of the guarantee schemes introduced in 2008 and last for the period of the guarantee.

Nevertheless, the serious threat that criminal activity of this kind poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised, and action against it has accordingly been a priority for Revenue over recent years.</p>  <p>  Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, including the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls underpinning a rigorous programme of enforcement action and supported by a range of new legislative measures that I brought forward in Finance Bills.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  I believe that this work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up earlier this year, in the framework of "A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan", of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue.  I understand that strategic and tactical plans have been agreed by all stakeholders to ensure that the activities of the agencies concerned are targeted as effectively as possible against those responsible for this form of criminality.</p>  <p>  Revenue works in close cooperation also with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.</p>  <p>  An analysis of the oil market undertaken by Revenue in 2015 indicates that the wide-ranging programmes of action taken against fuel fraud have had a significant impact on illegal activity.  This is borne out by feedback from fuel traders and their representative bodies, who report a significant reduction in the incidence of laundered fuel.  In addition, Revenue carried out an extensive random sampling programme early in 2016 which tested for the presence of the new fuel marker in the storage tanks of forecourt fuel retailers.  No samples tested positive for the new fuel marker.</p>  <p>  The penalties for offences relating to fuel smuggling and laundering are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999.  On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both.  Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both.  In addition, for an indictable offence under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, if the value of the smuggled fuel concerned exceeds &euro;250,000, including duty and taxes, the court may impose a penalty of three times the value of the fuel, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both.  The penalties were increased in the Finance Act 2010 to an amount significantly higher than that which had applied previously.  For example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.</p>  <p>  The courts decide on the level of fine to be applied in any particular case and, in practice, they do not apply fines up to the existing limits.  There are no proposals at present to increase the level of fines available to the courts.  However, the position is kept under review, taking account, among other considerations, of the practical experience of the fines imposed under the current provisions.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's work against fuel laundering has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action against fuel fraud will continue to be a high priority.</p></reply>

The tax will contribute towards important public health goals, as well providing a new source of revenue for public spending.  The Department of Health has also supported the introduction of a tax on SSDs in order to reduce added-sugar in diets, particularly the diets of children and young people.  The proposed tax on SSDs is seen as just one measure in the Department of Health's comprehensive plan to tackle obesity in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Sugar-sweetened drinks taxes have been introduced in a number of European countries in recent years.  The UK is due to introduce a soft-drinks industry levy from April 2018.  On Budget day I said that given the highly integrated production and supply chains which exist in the soft drinks industry between Ireland and the United Kingdom,  it would be prudent to align the Irish sugar-sweetened drinks tax with the UK's tax proposal, in terms of timeframe and structure.  I also launched a public consultation process on Budget day to get the views of all stakeholders in order to ensure that, when introduced, the tax is as effective as possible, as fair as possible, and minimises the administrative burden on business.  That public consultation process is currently underway and will be open to submissions until 3 January 2017.</p>  <p>  The estimated yield from the tax on SSDs will depend on the eventual design.  The Genral Excises Tax Strategy Group (TSG) paper 2016 examines options around an SSD tax and potential estimated yields.  Both the General Excises TSG paper and the Public Consultation paper are available on my Department's website. </p></reply>

I think it is important to be clear on what the Governor said.  He said that in addition to the four primary challenges he identified in the regulatory treatment of financial innovations, technological innovation may also alter the role of central banks in managing the money supply and acting as a lender of last resort.</p>  <p>  He instanced the growth in electronic forms of payment and said that at one level this growth looks set to reduce the traditional role of notes and coins in the monetary system.  He noted that this may have implications for the role of central banks generally in managing the money supply.  He also said that, at another level, there is much discussion on the relative merits of more widespread adoption of private-sector digital currencies versus a new role for central banks in the direct issuance and management of publicly-backed digital currencies.</p>  <p>  If, in time, there is to be a new role of this kind for central banks in the Euro area, it would have to be agreed at a European level.  The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament published a report on virtual currencies in May 2016 which called for the creation of a horizontal taskforce on distributed ledger technology to be set up under the leadership of the European Commission.  The Deputy is likely to be aware that the European Commission has published proposals to amend the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive including provisions on virtual currencies and negotiations on these proposals are ongoing.</p></reply>

This survey series seeks information from a significant sample of Irish SMEs from all sectors and regions of the country.  A total of 1,500 telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of Irish micro, small and medium SMEs.  The survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 80% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland's SME Market Report for the first half of this year also shows that rejection rates, for credit applications by SMEs, continues to decline and that they are now in line with the euro area average.</p>  <p>  SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks can seek support from the Credit Review Office (CRO).  This is a Government initiative which provides independent reviews of credit decisions at the request of SMEs.  It is a strictly confidential process between the business, the CRO and the bank.  The CRO overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the CRO, working with  other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

Revenue has committed to updating this analysis early next year to include trends in 2016 receipts and an analysis of factors underlying 2015 growth in receipts based on the returns data. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the analysis of 2015 tax receipts, along with information from Revenue's Large Cases Division, indicates that about half of the increase was from a small number of large multinationals and is attributable to a variety of reasons including improved trading conditions, positive currency fluctuations, some timing factors and a number of one-off payments.  However, the Deputy may wish to note, that certain information outlined in his request such as currency fluctuations is not captured on the returns and will not be separately identifiable from other reasons associated with profit growth underpinning the increase in tax.  </p><p>Based on macroeconomic forecasts, and information from Revenue indicating that the majority of the increased receipts are not based on once-off factors (and so likely to recur), my Department forecasts receipts of Corporation Tax of &euro;7.5 billion 2016 and &euro;7.7 billion in 2017.</p></reply>

I recently published an Update on Ireland's International Tax Strategy which sets out what we have done and what we plan to do regarding the implementation of the OECD BEPS recommendations.  In respect of the 15 BEPS reports:</p>  <p>  - BEPS Actions 2, 3 and 4 put forward recommendations that have been legislated for in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.  The Directive will therefore see three of the key OECD BEPS recommendations implemented consistently across Europe.  These are rules targeting hybrid mismatches, interest deductibility rules and Controlled Foreign Company rules. Ireland will implement these changes in line with agreed deadlines set out in the Directive.</p>  <p>  - Action 5 developed the modified nexus approach for IP regimes.  Ireland's Knowledge Development Box was introduced in line with this approach.  The Knowledge Development Box was reviewed by the OECD's Forum on Harmful Tax Practice and was declared to be the first such incentive to be fully compliant with the modified nexus rules agreed in BEPS Action 5.</p>  <p>  - Action 5 also makes recommendations on exchange of information.  Ireland is implementing the exchange of information requirements fully  in respect of tax rulings set out in this report.</p>  <p>  - Actions 6, 7 and 14 make a series recommendations for updating tax treaties to prevent tax treaty shopping and improve dispute resolution.  The BEPS multilateral instrument (MLI) will ensure that tax treaties are updated to reflect these BEPS recommendations.  The MLI is close to being agreed at the OECD. Ireland has played an active part in this work.</p>  <p>  - Actions 8 to 10 provide recommendations on transfer pricing.  In May this year, new transfer pricing rules were agreed at the OECD.  As set out in the recent update on Irreland's international tax strategy we are now considering what changes are required to ensure that Ireland's transfer pricing rules meet the standards set in the OECD transfer pricing guidelines.</p>  <p>  - Action 12 recommends the introduction of mandatory disclosure rules for promoters of tax schemes.  Ireland is one of the few countries to already have mandatory disclosure rules in our domestic legislation.</p>  <p>  - Action 13 recommends countries  introduce country-by-country reporting.  Ireland legislated for country-by-country reporting in Finance Act 2015 and signed a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement in January 2016 to share these reports with other tax authorities</p>  <p>  - The remaining BEPS reports, Actions 1, 11 and 15, do not make any specific recommendations.  Further work continues on the areas examined by these reports in various OECD working parties and Ireland is actively engaging in this work.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to take actions needed to implement the BEPS reports.  The review of Ireland s corporation tax code, which has been launched with Budget 2017, will include consideration of what further actions Ireland may need to take to ensure we are fully compliant with the OECD BEPS recommendations.  </p></reply>

The Directive includes five significant corporate tax anti-avoidance measures.  Three of the measures derive from the non-binding elements of the OECD BEPS process, with the remaining two measures coming from the European Commission's previous Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) Directive.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the measures that are derived from the non-binding elements of the BEPS process, namely the controlled foreign company rules, the hybrid mismatch rules and the interest limitation rules, these measures must be implemented by Member States by 1 January 2019.  However, the provisions on interest deductions (the interest limitation rule) may be deferred until 2024 for countries that already have strong targeted interest rules.  </p>  <p>  The Directive also proposes that an exit tax must be applied when a company moves its residence, its assets or a branch out of a Member State. Ireland currently has an exit tax which will be reviewed to determine what changes may be needed to ensure it is in line with the Directive.  The exit tax will need to be implemeneted by 1 January 2020.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Directive also proposes that Member States introduce a general anti-avoidance rule which disregards any non-genuine arrangements which are carried out by a company for the purpose of gaining a tax advantage.  Ireland in fact already has a similar General Anti-Avoidance Rule in our domestic tax law since the 1980s.  The general anti-abuse rule in the Directive will need to be implemented by 1 January 2019. </p>  <p>  The measures in the Directive will be implemented by Ireland to meet the agreed deadlines. </p></reply>

Section 472B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for an annual income tax allowance of &euro;6,350 for seafarers who satisfy certain conditions.  This is in addition to the standard tax credits that are generally available.</p>  <p>  The seafarers' allowance is conditional on a seafarer being at sea for at least 161 days in a tax year.  The duties must be wholly performed aboard sea-going ships on international voyages.  A sea-going ship is one that is registered in the relevant Register of a Member State and is used solely for the trade of carrying, by sea, passengers or cargo for reward.  An international voyage is a voyage that begins or ends in a port outside the State.  The most recent year for which figures are available is 2014 when a total of 160 individuals claimed the seafarer's allowance at a cost of approximately &euro;0.3 million.</p>  <p>  A review of the Marine taxation regime in Ireland was carried out in 2015.  A working group including the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was set up to oversee the Review and it liaised with other Government Departments and agencies including with the Marine Co-ordination Group (MCG) which is under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Indecon International Economic Consultants completed the review and carried out a consultation process with key stakeholders.  It encompassed a review of the tax supports available to the maritime sector in Ireland, analysis of the benefits available to the sector and the wider economy versus the Exchequer costs and made certain proposals for changes which could be made to enhance or maximise the value for money to the tax payer, taking EU State Aid considerations into account.</p>  <p>  Indecon provided economic information on the size of the marine sector, including employment in the sector and growth targets.  They also carried out a review of the existing supports, and the tax contribution of the marine sector to the Irish economy.  This included a review of marine tax measures in other countries, including the UK.</p>  <p>  I understand that the UK tax relief for seafarers is different in structure than Ireland's.  The approval of that scheme by the European Commission under state aid rules is a matter for the UK authorities.  The tax relief regime in Ireland, in addition to the PRSI exemption for seafarers, have both been approved by the European Union under the applicable state aid rules.</p></reply>

This is required under Regulation (EU) No 473/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area.  Draft budgetary plans have to be submitted in a common format.</p>  <p>  Ireland's Draft Budgetary Plan for 2017 was submitted to the European Commission on 17 October in line with requirements.</p>  <p>  The Commission assesses the plans for all euro area Member States as to whether they are compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Where the Commission identifies particular issues and risks in the submitted draft budgetary plans, it is required to consult with the Member State concerned within a week of receipt before taking further action.  This year, the Commission issued letters to seven Member States.  Ireland was not one of these Member States.</p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the Commission is required to issue its opinion on the draft budgetary plans by 30 November.  The opinion generally grades the draft budgetary plans as being compliant, partially compliant, or at risk of non-compliance.  The Commission's opinions are normally issued ahead of the deadline - the opinions are currently expected to be published in mid-November.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Finance Bill, this is not submitted to the European Commission as it is the domestic legislation that gives effect to the taxation measures announced as part of the Budget.  Any measures that may require approval from the Commission under State aid rules are subject to a commencement order pending approval from the Commission.  Likewise, the Estimates to be voted on by the D&aacute;il and the Social Welfare Bill are not  submitted to the European Commission.</p>  <p>  In terms of reporting, I would point out that the Commission's assessment of Ireland's Draft Budgetary Plan will, of course, be made public and I will comment accordingly.</p></reply>

Budget 2017 laid out an extensive range of policies targeted at these exposed sectors.</p>  <p>  In relation to the impact on tax revenue the joint work with the ESRI has estimated that over the medium to long term the government debt and deficit ratios are expected to worsen by 10.8 percentage points and 1 percentage point, respectively, after 10 years in the event of the UK entering a World Trade Organisation relationship with the EU.  I would stress that these are determined on a 'no policy change basis'.  With these potential adverse outcomes in mind Budget 2017 sought to build up Ireland's buffers to any 'Brexit' fallout.  Accordingly the Government has decided to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 percent to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth.  Further measures will be introduced over time once there is greater clarity on the exact timing of the UK's exit as well as the post-exit relationship between the EU and the UK.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also know that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out statutory requirements for mortgage lenders and credit servicing firms dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears on the mortgage loan secured by their primary residence.</p>  <p>  The CCMA includes guidelines on how co-operating borrowers are to be treated before legal action can commence.  It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur it may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.  Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.  Borrowers should also consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.</p>  <p>  With respect to the question of loans that have been sold to third parties, the Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans.</p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.  Data released by the Central Bank on 13 September shows that to end-Q2 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last twelve quarters.  Some 120,614 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.  It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender under the CCMA with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home.</p></reply>

The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 20 per cent between its peak in 2008 and September 2016.</p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling.  Similarly gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  This highlights the importance of maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies to help address emerging uncertainties.</p></reply>

This overall trend has been driven by price developments outside of Dublin, where residential property prices have increased by 1.8 per cent over the month and by 11.4 per cent on an annual basis.  In Dublin, residential property price inflation has been more subdued, increasing by 1.5 in August and by 4.5 per cent on an annual basis.  The pick-up in residential property price growth over the last two months follows several months of moderation, most likely reflecting the impact of Central Bank's macro-prudential measures.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property prices.  The recently announced Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing affirms the Government's commitment to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium with 84 actionable measures across five key pillars namely Address Homelessness, Accelerate Social Housing, Build More Homes, Improve the Rental Sector and Utilise Existing Housing.  Progress in delivering on these actions is being monitored on an ongoing basis and the first quarterly progress report has recently been published.</p></reply>

This will keep us on course to achieve our medium term target of a balanced budget in structural terms, defined as a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP, in 2018.</p>  <p>  It should be noted these calculations are highly sensitive and are a function of a number of factors including our deficit performance which is contingent upon the continuation of prudent fiscal policies, consistent with the EU fiscal rules.  Any deviation from this budgetary path could jeopardise achievement of this central assumption of our fiscal policy, particularly in relation to the post 2018 years when fiscal space opens up significantly on foot of achievement of a balanced budget in 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department's macroeconomic forecasts, which underpin the Budget, show growth of 4.2 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent next year.  The growth outlook for next year has been revised downwards by approximately &frac12; percentage point reflecting the uncertainty arising from the UK decision to leave the European Union.  Over the medium-term (2018-2021) the economy is projected to grow in line with potential at around 3 per cent per annum on average.  This growth is projected to be more balanced with strong positive contributions expected from both domestic demand and net exports.</p>  <p>  The short-term outlook for the labour market also remains positive. For this year, employment growth of 2.6 per cent (52,000 jobs) is projected, with the unemployment rate set to average 8.3 per cent.  For next year, employment gains of 2.1 per cent (43,000 jobs) are anticipated, with unemployment set to average 7.7 per cent. Employment growth averaging 1&frac34; per cent per annum is envisaged over the 2018-2021 period.  Aggregate labour supply is projected to continue to expand over the medium-term supported by a resumption in positive net migration and a pick-up in participation rates.  As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to fall towards 6 per cent by 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department closely monitors developments at macro- fiscal level and economic performance at a sectoral level. Government policy will continue to guard against the build-up of sectoral imbalances and to avoid over-dependence on a single sector, as was previously the case with Ireland's construction sector.</p>  <p>  The Fiscal and Economic Outlook published with the Budget notes that the economic landscape is characterised by considerable uncertainty at present, with risks firmly tilted to the downside.  A number of specific risks are identified, including those arising from further sterling depreciation and a "hard" Brexit.</p>  <p>  In view of such risks, it is appropriate that we should enhance our fiscal shock absorption capacity.  The Government has therefore decided to establish a rainy day fund, starting in 2019, once we have achieved a balanced budget in 2018 as envisaged.  This will be both a counter cyclical measure to avoid overheating, and will also enable us to deal with the initial effects of any shock that may occur.</p>  <p>  However, it is also appropriate to take additional measures.  While our debt ratio has fallen from a high of 120 per cent in 2013 to an expected 76 per cent this year it remains high in value and by comparison with others.  The Government has therefore decided to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 per cent to be reached by the mid-2020s or thereafter depending on economic growth well inside the 60 per cent required by the Stability and Growth Pact to take account of the particular risks that Ireland, as a small and very open economy, faces.</p></reply>

In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs.</p>  <p>  A key objective of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources.  The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and four non-bank on-lending partners.  The SBCI has a current funding capacity of &euro;1.05 billion which it makes available its on lending partners as demand from SMEs arises.  To the end of June 2016 the SBCI has lent &euro;347 million has been lent to over 8,600 SMEs, supporting more than 43,000 jobs across the country.</p>  <p>  Another recent initiative is the &euro;150 million agri-loan fund announced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This fund will provide highly flexible, low interest loans to farming SMEs.</p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.</p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office (CRO) is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The CRO overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit in order to ensure that there is sufficient access to finance for SMEs.</p></reply>

This equates to nominal wages adjusted for price levels using the GDP deflator. On the basis of this, data from the European Commission's AMECO database confirms that Ireland continues to rank above both the euro area and the wider EU average. In 2015, real compensation per employee was 10 per cent higher than the euro area average, and some 22 per cent higher than the wider EU average.</p><p>Ireland also continues to rank considerably above EU and euro area averages in terms of real GDP per capita. However, given distortions in Irish GDP data, GDP <i>per capita</i>is not considered to be a reliable measure by which to assess living standards. Whilst gross national product (GNP) or gross national income (GNI) are more appropriate for this purpose, relative comparisons cannot be made on a GNP basis as this measure is not readily available for other Member States. Whilst Irish GNI is lower than GDP, in the majority of other member states, GNI is broadly equivalent to GDP. Since Irish figures for 2015 are heavily distorted by upward revisions to our national accounts, instead output per capita figures reported below are for 2014. On the basis of real GNI per capita, again adjusting for differences in price levels across countries by using the GDP deflator, measured Irish living standards in 2014 were 17 per cent higher than the euro area, and 28 per cent higher than the EU.</p></reply>

The lack of a sufficient supply response to meet this demand has led to the current pressures in the housing market and requires structural measures to tackle the outstanding bottlenecks which continue to inhibit supply.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to supporting sustainable growth in housing supply and has set a target of ensuring that 25,000 new houses are built each year by 2020. To achieve this ambitious target, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government recently launched Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. The Action plan represents a whole of government response to the issues in the housing market with actionable measures across five key pillars, namely Address Homelessness, Accelerate Social Housing, Build More Homes, Improve the Rental Sector, and Utilise Existing Housing. The measures set out in the Action Plan should help to stimulate supply by streamlining the planning system, removing infrastructure blockages and supporting the delivery of affordable housing. </p>  <p>  Given the particular challenge faced by first-time buyers in accessing the housing market, I recently announced the Help-to-Buy initiative as part of Budget 2017. The Help-to-Buy initiative has been designed to complement the structural measures announced in Rebuilding Ireland by providing immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers of new homes. The targeted nature of the initiative should provide support to first time buyers in meeting their deposit requirements whilst also encouraging the construction of new housing units.</p></reply>

However, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies themselves based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. </p>  <p>  This inability to intervene in such matters is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  However, I do accept that it  is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise what is a volatile market. Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair. This group is examining factors that are contributing to the cost and availability of motor insurance and identifying what short-term, medium-term and long-term measures can be introduced to help consumers and businesses. A broad range of issues affecting the cost and availability of motor insurance are being examined by the Working Group, including the specific difficulties being faced by the haulage sector.</p>  <p>  As part of its consultation process, the Working Group has met with representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association of Ireland and submissions have been received from them.  The concerns and issues raised by these representative bodies are being considered by the Working Group.</p>  <p>  At the end of October 2016, the Working Group provided me with an initial set of emerging recommendations.  Since then, the Working Group has been working to finalise the Report and developing an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions. The report and action plan will detail any legislative or regulatory changes that may be required and will include a detailed timeline for implementation.</p></reply>

However the impact of the UK's exit from the EU on the Irish economy in the medium and long-term will become clearer as the trade arrangements between the UK and EU are settled. In order to take account of the issues emerging, in Budget 2017 my Department took Brexit into consideration in both its framing and its detail. In terms of framing, my Department incorporated the potential impact of Brexit into the macroeconomic forecasts for next year that underpinned Budget 2017. My Department also published an in-depth analysis of the sectors of the Irish economy and highlighted those with the greatest trade exposure to the UK. In light of the findings of the Department of Finance's in-depth sector analysis a number of taxation measures were announced in the Budget, with a view to getting Ireland "Brexit ready".</p>  <p>  At a macroeconomic level Budget 2017 sought to build up Ireland's buffers to any fallout from Brexit. Accordingly the Government has decided to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 percent to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth. This will improve Ireland ability to absorb a shock in addition to the rainy day fund announced in the Summer Economic Statement.</p></reply>

The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p>  <p>  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Additionally, following a review in 2015, the Central Bank Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises has been strengthened resulting in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016. The aim of the Code and these Regulations is to facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency, and provide a framework for dealing with financially difficult cases. </p>  <p>  The key effect of the enacted legislation is that purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p></reply>

However, section 60 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 prohibits VAT deductibility by businesses for anti-avoidance reasons on certain goods and services which, by their ubiquitous nature, are not easily distinguishable from general non-business use. Expenditure on motor vehicles, as well expenditure on petrol, food and drink, accommodation and entertainment is specifically excluded from deductibility entitlement, even where the goods and services are acquired or used for the purpose of a taxable business. As the anti-avoidance concerns regarding motor vehicle expenditure deductibility continue, the restriction on VAT deductibility remains valid.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have extended the VRT relief for hybrid and electric vehicles in the Finance Bill.

I can assure the Deputy that the Government takes the issue of housing provision extremely seriously and a number of measures are in place to address it.</p>  <p>  Under the previous Government a number of measures were introduced to support the provision of social housing services. The Social Housing Strategy 2020 launched in November 2014 sets out to address issues of social housing provision as well as accessibility and affordability. The Strategy aims to provide more than 35,600 new homes to meet social housing needs by 2020.</p>  <p>  As part of the Rent Stability, Housing Supply package, the previous government introduced a tax relief scheme to incentivise landlords to facilitate social housing tenancies. The scheme provides landlords with a 100% interest deduction for property let for a minimum of three years to a tenant in receipt of social housing supports. </p>  <p>  The new Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness complements and builds upon the Social Housing Strategy increasing the targeted level of social housing delivery to 47,000 units by 2021, supported by an investment of &euro;5.35 billion. </p>  <p>  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) are also currently examining the feasibility of establishing a new funding vehicle, in conjunction with the private sector, that is capable of funding the delivery of new mixed-tenure residential developments, with a strong focus on social housing, in a way that is both off-balance sheet and is commercially viable.</p></reply>

This is in recognition of the fact that a business cycle runs over several years and that it would be unbalanced to tax profits in one year and not allow losses in another. Ireland follows the international norm in that losses incurred in the course of a business are taken into account in arriving at the appropriate amount of tax that a company should bear. In relation to effective rates, analysis done by my Department has shown that our headline 12.5% rate is very close to the effective rates paid. Ireland has a low rate, applied to a broad base with a very small number of targeted incentives.</p>  <p>  In speaking about Minimum Effective Tax levels it is vital to know what data is being spoken about. Any calculation of effective tax levels must only consider profits which are legally taxable in the relevant country. What has been clearly shown is that in Ireland, companies pay very close to 12.5% rate on the profits which are correctly taxable in Ireland.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution. </p>  <p>  The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular are working closely with those Institutes operating in deficit, such as LYIT, to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The HEA has a policy framework in place for engaging with vulnerable IoTs which requires Institutes to submit a three year plan to return them to a balanced budget situation.  If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by a number of the Institutes of Technology (IoTs), including LYIT.  The Financial Review of the Institutes recently published by the HEA makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to funding problems in the IOT sector can be addressed.  My Department is working with the HEA  to action those recommendations.</p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for my Department particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so.  In seeking to address the issue in the short term, I have for the first time in nine years secured as part of Budget 2017, additional funding for the sector.  In 2017 additional funding of &euro;36.5m will be made available with &euro;160m additional over the next three years. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July, clearly outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Education Committee  and this consultation will form part of the process of formulating a plan for the future of the sector. </p></reply>

The use of school facilities must be approved by the school authority.  In 2005, my Department issued a circular to Trustees, Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Voluntary Secondary Schools (Circular Letter Prim 16/05) to encourage Trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community, education and recreation purposes.  This circular recognises that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p>  <p>  In facilitating such extra provision there are a number of complex issues that need to be considered in respect of such arrangements.  These issues - including property, governance, insurance and liability - are being considered as part of ongoing work within my Department of the requirements to be established around the use of school premises/property for various purposes, including afterschool care and the preparation of guidelines in relation to same.  I met with education partners during the summer to discuss the use of school buildings for wider community use, including afterschool care. </p>  <p>  To progress the range of commitments to create a high quality afterschool care system, my Department is working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  An interdepartmental group is looking at key issues and is expected to report to me and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs shortly.  These issues include:</p>  <p>  - Capacity and demand for services</p>  <p>  - Children's views on afterschool care</p>  <p>  - An appropriate quality and standards framework</p>  <p>  - The development of criteria for a capital scheme to be funded by DCYA</p>  <p>  - Estimated existing use of school buildings</p>  <p>  - Collaborative models with existing community/private service providers.</p></reply>

That programme is now fully funded and operated by this Department.</p>  <p>  Through the Schools Broadband Access Programme, the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary schools.  A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2012 which has ensured improved solutions are available to primary schools.  In 2015, it was agreed that over 1,100 school connections would be upgraded to 30Mbit/s or greater.  In line with the agreed plan, approximately 600 of these upgrades have been installed to date and the remainder will be installed in the coming months.</p>  <p>  While broadband provision is awarded to every school, there are a very small number of schools where we are still seeking an improved service owing primarily to their geographical location and the availability of broadband connectivity.  These schools are currently with the relevant broadband providers to investigate solutions and put in place the service, and this is the case for the school referred to by the Deputy.  There are also a small number of schools who choose not to participate in the schools broadband scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department continually reviews the availability and quality of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, within the parameters of the Programme and in compliance with procurement and contractual obligations</p>  <p>  However, the need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the new Digital Strategy for Schools and the Department will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to address this as a priority action.  Work on the implementation of the Strategy is under way.</p></reply>

These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level.  However, it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed.  The estimated cost of lifting the moratorium on posts of responsibility and restoring them to pre-moratorium levels would be in the order of &euro;50m. </p>  <p>  School leaders have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and student outcomes.  Leading on curricular change and change management are key challenges for every school leader.  The challenge for schools and the Department is therefore to build a leadership partnership that is fit for 21st century Ireland and school context.</p>  <p>  We have reviewed the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed up from teaching time and be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school and effective from the start of the 2016-17 school year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts to lift the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts in both the primary and post-primary sector.  A Department circular will issue in early January in relation to these new arrangements.</p>  <p>  Strengthening leadership is schools is a serious issue and these announcements provide additional resources to focus on leadership and management in our schools.</p></reply>

The report noted, however, that this is an indicative estimate, which is subject to certain growth conditions to be met, and that it is unrealistic to assume that the report can predict exactly the quantum of future student demand of Ss.  </p>  <p>  The extent of funding required to provide for S support in future years will, therefore, take into account the actual demand which transpires annually, while also taking into account the significant increases in S numbers recently provided in 2016. </p>  <p>  Data underpinning the S Scheme, as set out in the FPA, shows that overall the student to S ratio has increased from 2.2 in 2011/2012 to 2.5 in 2015/2016 due to changes in student numbers, the profile of disability of students and the S allocation. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the S to Pupil ratio varies across the school sector from mainstream class to special class to special school. In 2015 there was 1 S for 2.2 eligible children in Mainstream classes, 3.2 children in special classes and 3.31 children in special schools. As more Ss are introduced to schools it would be expected that the ratio of Ss to eligible pupils would move closer to that in special classes and schools. </p>  <p>  I recently requested the NCSE to lead a comprehensive review of the S scheme, in consultation with other relevant Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority (NDA) and in that context to:</p>  <p>  - Identify and recommend how, in the future, the additional care needs of students, over and above those needs that could be reasonably expected to be managed by teaching staff, should be met and</p>  <p>  - recommend the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs who have additional care needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive review will include a literature review of international and country studies to compare international norms.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will report to me on the progress of this review in May 2017.</p></reply>

Publication of the Bill reflects the commitment in the Programme for Government to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.</p><p>The Admissions Bill provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants.  The Bill also contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs).  The NCSE or the Child and Family Agency will not be able to increase a school&rsquo;s capacity, a school must have places available for a designation to be made.</p><p>In relation to the establishment of special classes, the NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE continues to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to special school placements there are currently over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level including 762 special classes for children with Autism.</p><p>The NCSE recently published a list of special classes for the 2016/17 school year.  In total there are 1,153 special classes available, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, are available on www.ncse.ie in county order, and with new classes identified.</p><p>The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.  These guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie  <i>.</i></p></reply>

This information was gathered using surveys, information and training days, self-reflective questionnaires and a formal review undertaken by my Department's Inspectorate. </p><p>Through these processes, schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources.  Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need. </p><p>In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs. </p><p>When the full review has been finalised, I will consider its findings and will also consider when the report should be published.</p></reply>

Details of the 197 successful school applicants in Categories 1 and 2 were announced on 28th April last, particulars of which are also published on my Department's website, www.education.i.e. </p>  <p>  Under SWS (2016-2017), valid applications from schools that were not reached for funding reasons from within the funding made available in 2016 will qualify to be assessed for purposes of the funding available in 2017, subject to the overall availability of funding.  If this arises, the terms and conditions of the scheme as outlined in Circular Letter (0055/2015) which may be accessed on my Department's website, will continue to apply when allocating funding to such projects. </p>  <p>  The normal practice is for the Minor Works Grant, that is payable to Primary schools only, to be announced late in the year if funding permits.  The issue of the Minor Works Grant (2016/2017) will be considered in the context of my Department's overall capital position later this year.</p>  <p>  The Emergency Works scheme funded by my Department addresses health and safety concerns of school authorities which pose an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which are sudden, unforeseen and require immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  To date in 2016, 405 applications were successful with 98 applications being refused funding, primarily because the works applied for did not meet the terms of the scheme.  Details of successful applications are published on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

The NCSE has also advised that the current model can lead to unnecessary labelling of children from a young age.</p><p>  The NCSE has proposed a new resource teaching allocation model which will, when introduced, remove the formal requirement for diagnostic assessment to access additional support and which will provide resources to schools based on school profiles.</p><p>Given that the NCSE has recommended the introduction of a new allocation model, it is considered that the best use of any additional resources will be to provide for the introduction of the new model, as opposed to revisiting the allocation basis of the old model.</p><p>As part the recent Budget announcements, I announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.  </p><p>An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 resource teacher posts. </p><p>This equates to an increase of 12% above the 7430 resource teacher posts currently allocated to schools for the 2016/17 school year, or an increase of 7% over the total combined allocation of resource teachers and learning support posts, of appoximately 12,500 posts, allocated to schools in 2016/17, either though NCSE allocations, or through general allocation. </p><p>Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools (i.e., schools with up to four classroom teachers).  Improvements to the staffing of these schools were announced for the 2015/16 school year.  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2016 announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule.  The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website will be implemented for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the staffing allocation for Small Primary Schools, Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools.  Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  The detailed arrangements will be set out in the staffing schedule circular for the 2017/18 school year. </p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the 2011/12 staffing schedule for small schools would be approximately &euro;7.5m.</p></reply>

This plan, which incorporates my Department's Strategy Statement as well as the Action Plan of Education outlines over one hundred actions to be implemented across the period 2016-2019.</p><p>It provides the strategic framework for planning and reporting across the Department and its agencies over the next three years and timeframes for each action are included. </p><p>The Plan contains commitments to ensure its successful delivery:</p><p>1. Actions and sub-actions have delivery timelines and are the responsibility of assigned officials</p><p>2. Quarterly progress reports will be published</p><p>3. Updated annual plans, which will take new developments into account, will be published</p><p>My aim for 2017 and subsequent years is to progressively deliver on the commitments set out in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, subject to the availability of resources.  It must be recognised that the Plan is being implemented within the context of overall budgetary constraints, and the large number of competing demands for available funding.  The Programme for Government commits the Government to working with the Oireachtas to increase expenditure on public services in order to meet the rising costs of demographics and to make targeted improvements in public services, including education, having regard to economic growth forecasts and adherence to fiscal rules.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-10a.456.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111000074#WRL02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 to 167, inclusive, together.  </p><p>The objective of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to encourage support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.  Funding is available under the Scheme towards the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of equipment, i.e. a personal alarm and/or pendant, while the associated monitoring and service charges are the responsibility of the individual participant. </p><p>As part of a review of the Scheme in 2010, one of the recommendations was that a centralised procurement process would simplify the Scheme.  By decreasing the level of administration for the community-based organisations, this would allow them to spend more time on the key aim of the Scheme, which is enhanced engagement with older members of the community.  It would also achieve value for money through economies of scale.</p><p>My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and, arising from this, it was decided that the Scheme should be managed by Pobal, given its significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.  The management and administration of the Scheme transferred from the Department to Pobal on 7 September 2015. </p><p>The community based organisations that wish to support older people with the supply of personal monitored alarms are required to register with Pobal before operating the scheme.  It is important to stress that a paper-based registration process is available to facilitate those community-based organisations unable to register online.  Pobal also operates a telephone helpline facility to assist with any queries (tel. no. 01 5117222). </p><p>Once registered, the community-based organisations can then submit participant applications on behalf of elderly people living in their defined area of operation.  There is no closing date for receipt of registrations. </p><p>This new approach was designed to reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary organisations registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly.  It also enables the organisations to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and interact with the elderly in their local communities.  This will enhance the outcome for both beneficiaries and community groups alike.</p><p>Pobal are currently undertaking a general review of the Scheme.  This review will identify potential improvements, including technological advances.  On completion of the review, a new Scheme will be put in place.  Consultation with relevant stakeholders, including local communities, service users and civic organisations, is a key component of the review, the results of which will inform my Department&rsquo;s policy on the future direction of the Senior Alerts Scheme. </p><p>The data relating to the number of persons benefitting from alarms and the number of groups which administer the scheme is set out in the following tables.  As a result of the transfer of administration of this scheme from my Department to Pobal in September 2015, the information contained in Table 1 relates to the period from 1 January 2014 to 6 September 2015, while the information contained in Tables 2 and 3 relates to the period from 7 September 2015 to date.  It should be noted that, following the transfer of the scheme to Pobal, all community-based organisations that wished to support older people with the supply of monitored alarms were required to register with Pobal. </p><p><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th colspan="2">Number of Organisations Submitting Claims</th><th colspan="2">Number of

These specify requirements in relation to a range of matters such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.</p><p>Details of the main features of these requirements are outlined in the Guide to Minimum Standards in Rented Accommodation, which is available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with each local authority, which has the power carry out an inspection of the property to assess whether it meets the minimum requirements.  If a property does not comply, the local authority can apply a series of sanctions against a landlord up to and including prosecution in the District Court.  Where a person believes a landlord is in breach of these regulations they can report the matter directly to the relevant local authority.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established under the Residential Tenancies Act in September 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.  Where a landlord does not comply with their obligations under a lease or tenancy agreement, a tenant may refer a dispute to the RTB for resolution. </p><p>In circumstances where a receiver is appointed to a landlord's interest in a dwelling it is essential that the rights of tenants are protected.  While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the policies and procedures of banks in appointing receivers cannot affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants.  The appointment of a receiver does not mean that a tenant loses their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  </p><p>The RTB&rsquo;s website, www.rtb.ie contains a variety of information for tenants and landlords on their rights and obligations.  The website also provides easy access to information relating to the RTB services and makes available downloadable copies of RTB&rsquo;s reports and forms.</p></reply>

Employer contributions payable to a defined contribution scheme in respect of each employee must be remitted within 21 days of the end of the month in which they became payable.</p>  <p>  Under Section 59 of the Act, trustees are required to ensure insofar as is reasonable that the contributions payable by the employer and the employees of the scheme/trust RAC where appropriate are received and that the sums are invested within 10 days of the latest date on which those sums should have been remitted or paid by the employer.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the regulator responsible for the enforcement of the criminal sanctions available and it is proactive in the prosecution of offences under section 58A.

The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements, including certain pension contributions due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The scheme covers former employees of companies that are in a formal wind-up procedure such as liquidation or receivership, or situations where the employer has died or been declared bankrupt.  </p>  <p>  My Department holds figures from 2012 on the number of individual claims (not companies).

Work placements are identified in the not-for-profit, community and voluntary sectors across the country, through local advertisement and direct contact with eligible organisations by the IBs.  Practically all types of work delivered by the community and voluntary sector can be undertaken by T&uacute;s participants, once they do not displace existing public or private sector employment.  Eligible organisations do not have to be specifically listed on the Register of Charities.</p>  <p>  Organisations wishing to offer work placements, or requiring certain work to be undertaken, can contact their local IB.  Each IB provides an easy to navigate application process.  This involves the work placement provider setting out the work to be undertaken, the skills required and the length of time it is anticipated to execute the works.  Additionally, the IB will meet representatives of the applicant organisation and organise an inspection of the works to be undertaken.</p>  <p>  While the type of work undertaken is determined locally, it must be consistent with the terms and conditions of the T&uacute;s scheme.  The Board of each IB must operate selection processes that provide sufficient information to enable a complete assessment of the suitability of placement providers.</p>  <p>  The Department takes very seriously any allegations of failure to comply with the conditions of T&uacute;s and investigates all such complaints of which it is notified.  The Department&rsquo;s own control measures with respect to T&uacute;s are based on a combination of random monitoring visits/inspections of IBs and placement providers and the investigation of any complaints received.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a specific case he is concerned about, my Department will be happy to investigate it once details are provided.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

While the statement reiterates that the EU stands ready to continue to engage in political dialogue with Turkey at all levels, it also expresses grave concern at the suggestions to reinstate the death penalty, regrets the restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, including the arrest of journalists, and is critical of the actions taken against members of the opposition. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with other Member States, will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>

While Secretary of State Kerry does not carry policy responsibility for immigration reform, he was personally very sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented Irish and was hopeful that progress could be made in the future.</p>  <p>  While in Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Taoiseach and I met President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Ryan, Senator Chuck Schumer and other key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  During these meetings we emphasised the situation of the undocumented Irish in the US and encouraged both Houses of Congress to work on a bipartisan basis towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures.  The Taoiseach again discussed the prospects for immigration reform with Vice President Biden during his visit to Ireland in July.</p>  <p>  I also availed of my visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly in September to meet Irish community leaders in the United States, to discuss with them the prospects for achieving immigration reform and to reassure them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the issue.  In addition, Minister of State McHugh met representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, representing a broad group of Irish centres across the United States, in New York on 20 September.  That meeting was also attended by Senator Billy Lawless of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington continue to work closely with Irish American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform.  There is little prospect of comprehensive reform being achieved within the lifetime of the outgoing Congress and the current policy platform of the Trump campaign would not suggest that it will be an immediate priority for the incoming Administration.  Nevertheless, our Ambassador and Embassy staff in Washington DC are working with their contacts on both sides of the political aisle to assess the basis for a renewed initiative once a new Administration and Congress have been established in Washington DC.</p></reply>

The Government continues to work closely with all relevant stakeholders in this regard.</p><p>Progress on implementing the provisions of both the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements are considered at periodic review meetings.  These are attended by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  I represent the Government at these meetings.  The last review was held on 29 June 2016, and the next meeting has been scheduled for 14 December.</p><p>There has been sustained progress with the implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement over the last year, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments. </p><p>Together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, I hosted a trilateral ministerial meeting on enhancing law enforcement co-operation on the island, as envisaged by the Fresh Start Agreement, in Farmleigh on 21 December 2015.  This meeting, which included the two Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, also launched the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime.</p><p>The Joint Agency Task Force quickly became fully operational and is progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it.  The Task Force builds on existing operational arrangements to tackle organised crime, including that linked to paramilitarism, on a cross-border basis.  The Task Force reports on its work to the two Justice Ministers within the framework of their regular meetings under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Criminal Justice Co-operation, as provided for in the Fresh Start Agreement.</p><p>The Government is meeting<s>s</s>its commitments as regards infrastructure projects<font color="#004080"> </font>under the Fresh Start Agreement.  This includes a contribution of &euro;25 million from the Irish Government in 2019 for the upgrading of the A5 Western Transport Corridor road project, which is in addition to the &euro;50 million previously committed.  The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and is to be matched by the NI Executive.  Discussions are continuing at senior official level with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on other infrastructure projects, including the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Ulster Canal and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.</p><p>As provided for in Fresh Start, a three-person Panel was appointed in December to recommend the elements of a strategy for the disbandment of paramilitary groups.  This panel, comprising Lord John Alderdice, Monica McWilliams, and John McBurney, made over forty recommendations.  The Northern Ireland Executive updated the June review meeting on its then draft Action Plan to take these recommendations forward.  In July, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime. </p><p>The Northern Ireland Executive is committed to carrying out research into the social costs and implications of paramilitarism; to undertake a public awareness campaign on the harms done by paramilitarism and organised crime; and to report on efforts to tackle paramilitarism which will be linked to wider cross-Departmental and statutory agency work programmes aimed at reducing community divisions and the causes of sectarianism. </p><p>On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The Fresh Start Agreement provides that the IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021. The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law.  The aim is to get the IRC established and up and running as soon as possible. </p><p>The NI Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015.  The UK Treasury has also approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education. </p><p>The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and SDLP following the Assembly election last May. </p><p>In June, the Co-Chairs and members of the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Commission were appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Commission is now progressing its work, as foreseen in the Stormont House Agreement and reiterated in Fresh Start. </p><p>With regard to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during the Fresh Start Agreement talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments. </p><p>I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive and other parties in Northern Ireland, to see how we can to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  While there remain a number of outstanding issues, there is an urgent need to achieve progress - so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

All of these are now either completed or very close to completion, and will take up all of their planned 2016 allocation by the end of this year.</p><p>There were also unavoidable delays in some other cases &ndash; for example, the National Monument at 14-17 Moore Street and the major redevelopment at the National Archives. While some progress has been made on these projects, the full expected drawdown of funds will not now occur this year.</p><p>With regard to the Rural and Regional Programme, the main delay in drawdown is in relation to the LEADER Programme and is due to the fact that the new programme has only recently commenced.</p><p>Timing issues in relation to the drawdown of funding across a number of other subheads have also contributed to the current underspend against profile but it is anticipated that these will rectify by year end. All of the subheads showing an underspend against profile as at 31 October 2016 are listed in the table.</p><p>All expenditure within my Department's Vote continues to be carefully monitored to ensure the best use of available financial resources.  Public Financial Procedures provide that a maximum of 10% of the capital envelope of a Vote may be carried over by way of deferred surrender to the following year for spending in that year on priority capital programmes subject to the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Sanction has also been received to vire some capital savings to meet pressures across a number of subheads and programme areas.</p><p>It is too early to accurately forecast the final end of year outturn at this point in time but no savings beyond those which can be carried forward by deferred surrender into 2017 are envisaged at present .<table><tr><th colspan="2">Subheads showing an underspend against profile at 31 October 2016 </th></tr><tr><td>A.4 </td><td>General Expenses of the National Archives and National Archives Advisory Council </td></tr><tr><td>A.5 </td><td>General Expenses of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Chester Beatty Library, National Concert Hall and the Crawford Gallery </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A.6 </td><td>Regional Museums, Galleries, Cultural Centres and Projects </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A.8 </td><td>Culture Ireland </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A.11 </td><td>General Expenses of the National Library of Ireland </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A.13 </td><td>General Expenses of the National Gallery of Ireland </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A.15 </td><td>Decade of Centenaries 1912-1922 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A.16 </td><td>Cork Events Centre </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B.4 </td><td>Built Heritage </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B.5 </td><td>Natural Heritage (National Parks and Wildlife Service) </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B.6 </td><td>Irish Heritage Trust </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B.7 </td><td>Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B.8 </td><td>Peatlands Restoration </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C.3 </td><td>Gaeltacht Support Schemes </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C.4 </td><td>Irish Language Support Schemes </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C.5 </td><td>An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C.9 </td><td>Islands </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C.10 </td><td>20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C.11 </td><td>Decade of Centenaries &ndash; Teach an Phiarsaigh </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>E.3 </td><td>Dormant Accounts Measures </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>E.4 </td><td>Western Development Commission </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>E.6 </td><td>LEADER &ndash; Rural Economy Sub Programme </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>E.8 </td><td>Town and Village Regeneration </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating. Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80 to 90% of patients.  This red, raised skin rash (often called a bulls-eye rash) develops between 3 days and a month after a tick bite and spreads outwards from the initial bite site. People can also complain of 'flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue.  Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, joints, the heart or other tissues.  Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. </p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. The Weekly Infectious Disease Report, published by the HPSC on 26 October 2016, indicated that for week 42-2016 (16/10/16-22/10/16) there have been 16 cases notified so far in 2016 &ndash; an increase of 5 on the same period last year. However, the diverse and unspecific nature of the symptoms means that a number of the less serious cases may not be diagnosed, leading to an underreporting of cases.  Recent estimates suggest that there may be up to 50-100 cases in Ireland per year.</p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered. In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:</p>  <p>  -  Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);</p>  <p>  -  Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease;</p>  <p>  -  For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. representation has also been sought from a Lyme Disease advocacy group.</p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:</p>  <p>  -  To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;</p>  <p>  -  To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the general public;</p>  <p>  -  To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international practice;</p>  <p>  -  To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;</p>  <p>  -  To develop strategies to raise awareness among the general public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;</p>  <p>  -  To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.</p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-committee.The Sub-Committee  is expected to report in 2017.</p></reply>

The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State. In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;</p><p>- Local market price; and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which was published in July 2015, committed to a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>Work has been under way on this Review for a number of months now and it is expected to be completed in the coming months.</p><p>The HSE has recently published the cost of care for all public nursing homes. There are a number of reasons why the costs of public facilities are generally higher than those in the private sector, including a higher nurse staffing ratio and the impact of public service rates of pay and conditions of employment.</p><p>The geographical spread of residential placements is also a factor. In some rural areas long stay beds are provided for geographical reasons in smaller centres which would not be profitable for a private provider to supply, e.g. Achill Island and Donegal.</p><p>With that said, it is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible and deliver the best possible value for money.  Towards that end the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities. Differences in the comparative cost of public and private long-term residential care will also be the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review to be undertaken by the Department of Health in 2017 to assess reasons for and components of current cost differentials.</p></reply>

The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis. A summary of the HTA has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .</p><p>The HSE has since had further engagements with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Orkambi. This process is ongoing The HSE will consider the outcome of these engagements and any other, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement. </p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out-of-hours cooperatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services helping to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Where GPs decide not to become members of out-of-hours co-ops they must still discharge their contractual obligation in terms of out-of-hours provision in accordance with their GP contract.</p>  <p>  In the Mid West region, the out-of-hours arrangements for participating GPs are discharged through Shannondoc, a not-for-profit GP cooperative, which is funded by the HSE.  Shannondoc has recently indicated that due to a difficulty in attracting GPs, and in particular locum cover, it is no longer able to maintain its existing service across all its centres.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Shannondoc, the HSE, in order to ensure the sustainability of the service, accepted a proposal from the cooperative to changes in the provision of the service.

Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  </p>  <p>  The functions of the Minister for Health in relation to HIQA, and the Chief Inspector of Social Services are prescribed in the Act, and in this respect the Chief Inspector is independent in the exercise of these functions. </p>  <p>  However, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, as amended, include provisions governing individual assessment and care plan for residents.  The regulations also include provisions governing the contract for provision of services, including a requirement that a discharge shall be discussed, planned for and agreed with a resident and, where appropriate, with their family or carer, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. </p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  The provision of homecare is a service matter and that aspect has accordingly been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

This Government has secured a total budget of &euro;14.6 billion for the health service in 2017, the highest ever health budget. This funding will allow for the filling of a significant number of nursing and other key service delivery posts. </p>  <p>  There are many initiatives currently underway to improve staffing levels throughout the country.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives. In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 is available to nurses who return from overseas. </p>  <p>  The HSE People Strategy is supported by detailed Work Plans to deliver the outcomes required under the direction of the HR Leadership Team.  The work plans intend to specifically address the responsiveness of the recruitment process to add pace to the timeline between approval and appointment including the establishment of &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; panels and to restructure recruitment to achieve optimum delivery of workforce plans.  The HSE are also in the process of developing a HR Delivery Model and a consultation document has been circulated, this is expected to be finalised by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  HSE Health Business Services (HBS) provide a range of services across five functional areas, one of which is the National Recruitment Service (NRS).  The NRS will continue to implement the Recruitment Strategy with Corporate HR HSE and other stakeholders. </p>  <p>  As part of the pre-appointment screening process the NRS verify all information provided to them in order to complete assessment of the candidate with regard to their suitability and competence for the particular post.  This is for the protection and interest of all patients, service users and staff.  The information disclosed on the Garda Vetting Form is the property of the organisation in the first instance and therefore under Data Protection it should not be passed from organisation to organisation.</p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.  </p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success.  I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the twelve individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  In July this year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year. </p>  <p>  In the light of the UK vote to leave the EU I convened a special meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee to consider the immediate impact of the UK decision.  I intend to include this issue as a standard item on the agenda of each future meeting of the HLIC.  It is clear that ensuring action is taken on the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, assumes even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.  However, I see no compelling reason at this point to review the strategy.  </p></reply>

One of my priorities is to support the provision of lower-cost flexible finance so I was pleased to announce plans for a &euro;150 million fund for 'Agri Cash Flow Support' as part of the recent Budget. </p>  <p>  The provision of &euro;11.1 million in EU funding for milk and other livestock farmers under the exceptional adjustment aid package, will be supplemented by &euro;14 million in national funding from my Department.  The &euro;25 million total will enable the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to leverage a fund of &euro;150 million, thereby maximising the support for farmers from the available public funding.  The extra national funding will enable loans to be made available to non-livestock sectors, including tillage and horticulture, under &ldquo;de minimis&rdquo; State Aid provisions.</p>  <p>  This fund will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%, which will represent a significant saving to farmers when compared with other forms of finance currently available.  The loan fund is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments. </p>  <p>  Further details of the loan fund will be provided shortly but it is expected that it will be operational as soon as possible.  The SBCI will make an open call for lending institutions to participate and I have spoken to the main banks to encourage them to make this facility available to their customers.  Normal lending assessment criteria will apply although the loans will be &lsquo;unsecured&rsquo; in nature, thereby facilitating a more straightforward application process. </p></reply>

An authorisation is also required to retain mussel seed on board a vessel, to trans-ship mussel seed from a vessel or to land mussels from a vessel.  In addition, the Mussel Seed (Fishing) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 311 of 2006) specify certain requirements for vessels engaged in mussel seed fishing. The enforcement of this sea-fisheries legislation is a matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, which is independent in the performance of its functions.  The fishery closed this year on 5 November in accordance with S.I. No. 551 of 2016 Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction (Mussel Seed) (Opening of Fisheries) (Amendment) Regulations 2016.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the fishing regulations referred to above, the fishing activity is also subject to a number of Fisheries Natura Declarations which have been made following appropriate assessment of the potential impact of the activity on the features of Natura 2000 sites in the Irish Sea (including the Dublin Bay area) and in Castlemaine Harbour.  The Declarations and related documents are published online at www.fishingnet.ie.</p></reply>

The NCSC has been developing its services over the last number of years, focussing first on building the State&rsquo;s governmental Computer Security Incident Response Team. This team, known as CSIRT-IE, provides incident response support and improved situational awareness in regard to current cyber security alerts and threats to Government Departments and key State Agencies.  For obvious operational security reasons, it would not be appropriate to comment on specific threats.</p>  <p>  In July 2016, the European Union formally adopted a Directive on security of network and information systems (2016/1148).  The Directive is required to be transposed in the State by May 2018 and will require regulation of cyber security in the finance, energy, transport, health, water distribution and digital sectors in Ireland.  I have recently briefed Government on the importance of this new legislation.  My Department is currently undertaking a public consultation on the Directive, and following this I will be seeking the Government Agreement to draft primary legislation to formally establish the NCSC on a statutory basis. The NCSC would undertake a number of regulatory functions under the Directive, in addition to an obtaining additional powers to conduct more general cyber security work, including the protection of Government systems.</p></reply>

The first Technology Review public consultation on a new renewable support scheme was published in 2015 and following the completion of detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting a range of renewable technologies - including Solar (PV) - a second public consultation will be published in early 2017.

I understand that Electric Ireland decided to close the scheme to new entrants from the end of 2014. More recently, Electric Ireland extended the tariff to their existing customers from the end of 2015 until the end of 2016. Electric Ireland publish details of the scheme on their website <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>To date, no other electricity supplier has chosen to provide such a tariff, to either domestic or commercial customers, although they have been invited to do so by the  CER.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Renewable Electricity Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for energy exported to the grid. These schemes, which are now closed for new applications, have proven successful at encouraging the development of renewable generation.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that 25.3% of electricity was generated by renewable sources at end 2015.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The existing REFIT support schemes are underpinned by detailed economic analysis to ensure long-term certainty for investors and overall value for money for consumers.  The REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period and cover a range of different renewable energy technologies, including wind energy, biomass and hydro-generation and microgeneration. Solar technologies are not eligible for support under the REFIT schemes.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Energy White Paper, published in December 2015, sets out a high-level framework for Ireland's energy transition to a low carbon economy and society and identifies a range of measures and actions to support this aim. One key action is to explore the scope to provide market support for microgeneration technologies.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My Department is currently working on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). While no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of a variety of technologies - including wind, solar photovoltaics (PV), hydro and biomass - are being examined as part of the on-going assessment process.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Once the economic analysis is complete, a further public consultation on the new scheme will be published. This consultation is expected in the first half of 2017 and details will be advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website </font><i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.  <font color="#0D0D0D">It is expected that the new scheme will be announced in late 2017, subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.</font></p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the REFIT reference prices for 2016 (in euro per megawatt hour) are available on this Department&rsquo;s website and are provided in the following table. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>Tariffs  per                                                                                    MWh (&euro;)   2016</th></tr><tr><td></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><b>REFIT 1 </b></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Large Wind (above 5MW) </td><td>69.72 </td></tr><tr><td>Small Wind (equal to or less than 5MW) </td><td>72.167 </td></tr><tr><td>Hydro </td><td>88.068 </td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas </td><td>85.622 </td></tr><tr><td>Other Biomass </td><td>88.068 </td></tr><tr><td><b>REFIT 2 </b></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Large Wind (above 5MW) </td><td>69.72 </td></tr><tr><td>Small Wind (equal to or less than 5MW) </td><td>72.167 </td></tr><tr><td>Hydro </td><td>88.068 </td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas </td><td>85.622 </td></tr><tr><td><b>REFIT 3 </b></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion </td><td>89.314 </td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion - Energy Crops </td><td>99.822 </td></tr><tr><td>Large Biomass CHP (above 1500kW) </td><td>126.091 </td></tr><tr><td>Small Biomass CHP (equal to or less than 1500kW) </td><td>147.106 </td></tr><tr><td>Large AD Non CHP (above 500kW) </td><td>105.076 </td></tr><tr><td>Small AD Non CHP (equal to or less than 500kW) </td><td>115.583 </td></tr><tr><td>Large AD CHP (above 500kW) </td><td>136.598 </td></tr><tr><td>Small AD CHP (equal to or less than 500kW) </td><td>157.613 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in the renewable heating sector and to help reach Ireland&rsquo;s 12% target by 2020. In 2015, it is estimated that 6.5% of heat was derived from renewable sources. The proposed RHI scheme is </font>aimed at supporting larger industrial and commercial installations outside of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. From a national policy perspective, the focus on the non-ETS sector is likely to accrue a double benefit for the Irish taxpayer, helping to meet our renewable energy target and reduce emissions in the non-ETS sector, simultaneously.</p><p>Analysis to date suggests that it would not be cost effective, at this stage, to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI. This is due to a number of factors including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems as well as the significantly greater costs associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The overall costs and technologies to be supported under the new RHI Scheme will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.

This co-ordinated, Government-led, strategy aims to reduce both overall population and individual risk, particularly for people living in areas with high radon levels.</p>  <p>  Cost has been identified as a disincentive to householders to both test and remediate their homes for radon. The NRCS contains a number of recommendations, one of which is to explore possible financial incentives to encourage household action on radon. My Department is examining the feasibility of providing such financial incentives. A decision will be taken in the coming months on whether and, if so, how to proceed once the examination of options is complete.</p></reply>

However, the feasibility of establishing a hydrogen refuelling network will be regularly assessed to take account of changes in technological development and market uptake.    </p>  <p>  This is one of a number of measures in the draft framework, which is aimed at supporting the uptake of alternatively fuelled vehicles in Ireland.   Diversifying the fuel mix in transport across a range of alternative fuels will ultimately provide the means through which this sector can transition away from oil dependency over the next two decades, supporting our long-term goal to decarbonise the transport sector in Ireland by 2050.</p></reply>

Better Regulation Policy aims to ensure that the processes for generating new regulation, and for evaluating existing regulation, are as effective and efficient as possible.  Regulation should achieve the policy goals underpinning it in the least costly manner possible, without undermining the protections that regulation provides.</p>  <p>  A Government decision in April 2012 outlined the assignment of lead responsibility in respect of various functions in the regulatory area across a number of relevant departments. The functions assigned to my Department are reducing red tape/administrative burden; competition issues, and representing Ireland at EU/OECD/International fora. Lead responsibility for Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) rests with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, while the Department of the Taoiseach has lead responsibility for Effectiveness of Regulators. Lead responsibility for transparency/quality of legislation lies with the Department of the Taoiseach (Cabinet Secretariat), and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p>  <p>  The principal tool for assessing impacts, including economic impacts, of new regulation is the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). As outlined in the 2009 Revised RIA Guidelines, the RIA is used by all Government Departments and Offices and applies to proposals for primary legislation involving changes to the regulatory framework, significant Statutory Instruments; proposals for EU Directives and significant EU Regulations when they are published by the European Commission; Policy Review Groups bringing forward proposals for legislation are also expected to carry out RIAs. In addition, where legislative proposals are to be considered by Cabinet Committees, RIAs should be prepared by Departments, for consideration by relevant Senior Officials' Groups, prior to their discussion by such Committees.</p>  <p>  According to the 2009 Revised RIA Guidelines, it is not compulsory to apply RIA to the Finance Bill, and emergency, security and some criminal legislation. Other circumstances in which the RIA need not be used include the case of a regulatory proposal consolidating existing legislation and where no regulatory changes are being introduced; if legislation is drafted as a result of a court decision which leaves no discretion to consider alternative options or allow for meaningful consultation; where primary legislation is required to ratify international treaties which the Government has already signed up to and the proposed legislation does not go beyond the Treaty provisions and is only ratifying the Treaty &ndash; though if there are additional regulatory requirements then an RIA should be produced.</p></reply>

Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years and we have climbed from 15<sup>th</sup>to 7<sup>th</sup>in the 2016 IMD competitiveness rankings. We have moved from 24<sup>th</sup>to 23<sup>rd</sup>in the WEF Competitiveness Report and we are now ranked 18ths out of 190 countries in the World Bank Doing Business report.</p><p>The World Bank's Doing Business report looks at domestic, primarily small and medium size companies and measures the regulations applying to them through their life cycle. Based on standardised case studies, it presents quantitative indicators on business regulation that can be compared across 190 economies and over time. Doing Business goes beyond identifying that a problem exists and points to specific regulations or regulatory procedures that may lend them to reform.</p><p>In the 2017 report, Ireland&rsquo;s was ranked 18<sup>th</sup>&ndash; down 3 places, compared with our revised 2016 ranking. While this is disappointing, Ireland is ranked 8<sup>th </sup>amongst EU member states. Doing Business also highlights many strengths &ndash; for example, we are ranked 5<sup>th</sup>for &ldquo;paying taxes&rdquo; and 10<sup>th</sup>for &ldquo;starting a business&rdquo;. </p><p>Furthermore, in terms of the Distance to Frontier benchmark - which measures Ireland&rsquo;s score against the benchmark set by the best performing economy across ten different category headings &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s performance has actually improved slightly since 2016. Of course, other countries are also striving to improve their business environments, hence the improvement in our score but drop in our ranking.</p><p>This serves to remind us that competitiveness is a relative measure. The process of reform and improvement must be continuous. </p><p>I would also note that Ireland is a strong performer in other international competitiveness rankings &ndash; this year, for instance, we are ranked 7<sup>th</sup>out of 61 countries in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook - an improvement of 9 places from last year. </p><p>In July of this year, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual <i>Competitiveness Scorecard</i>benchmarking report which provides an in-depth assessment of all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance. The Council found that while Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years &ndash;and has been central to recent strong economic growth, a number of threats persist, not least of which is Brexit. </p><p>The analysis contained in the Scorecard report is informing the development of the Council&rsquo;s annual policy report <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016</i>which I will shortly be brining to Government for consideration and which will contain a range of actions to enhance competitiveness. </p><p>My officials will continue to monitor publications such as the World Bank Doing Business report. Further actions and reforms - driven by the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs which is currently being prepared - will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world&rsquo;s most competitive countries and improve the ease of doing business, ultimately helping us to achieve our objective of sustainable full employment.</p></reply>

The growth potential was set in the context of the macro-economic forecasts contained in the Short-term Economic and Fiscal Outlook for the period 2014-2021 prepared by the Department of Finance. The Programme for Partnership Government affirms the ambition for the creation of 200,000 more jobs over the period 2016 to 2020 and my focus is on ensuring we deliver on that potential.</p>  <p>  As a small open economy, Ireland needs to have an agile policy system in place so that it can respond effectively to change. The development of Enterprise 2025 was informed by ongoing global uncertainties &ndash; including economic, geo-political and technological uncertainties. </p>  <p>  The core premise of Enterprise 2025 is that our policies will build resilience in our enterprise base &ndash; through increased investment in innovation, enhanced productivity and competitiveness, and by diversifying our export markets beyond the UK, and to broaden our geographic source markets for FDI. </p>  <p>  This basic premise remains valid in the altered landscape post Brexit. The UK vote does mean, however, that we need to redouble our efforts to work with our Irish owned enterprises to manage through the uncertainty, and with foreign owned MNEs to capture opportunities for FDI.  </p>  <p>  In this context, I have secured the largest ever capital budget at &euro;555 million for my Department - a 10 percent year on year increase.  I have secured sanction for 50 additional staff across the agencies that will be deployed both at home and overseas to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. While accepting that new challenges exist, we remain ambitious and I have agreed targets with IDA and Enterprise Ireland to bring employment in each of their portfolios to over 200,000 next year.  </p>  <p>  I have established a Brexit Coordination Group within the Department where my senior officials and agency CEOs meet regularly to work through what needs to be done &lsquo;on-the-ground&rsquo; to anticipate and respond to what is as yet an unknown outcome in terms of economic impact. We have increased our trade mission activity and engagement with potential investors in FDI.  Enterprise Ireland has undertaken a review of its client base and is focused on supporting companies in the areas of market diversification, planning their next steps, competitiveness and innovation. </p>  <p>  In addition in Budget 2017, the Minister for Finance introduced a number of measures to help get Ireland Brexit ready including: the retention of the 9 per cent VAT rate to help the tourism and hospitality sector to maintain competitiveness; the extension of the Foreign Earnings Deduction and of SARP until 2020; an increase to the earned income tax credit for the self-employed to encourage entrepreneurship; as well as the establishment of a rainy day fund. The Government is confident that appropriate fiscal policies are now in place. This will help us to adjust to the economic effects of the UK's negotiated withdrawal from the EU.  </p>  <p>  To reiterate, the UK vote has served to accelerate rather than redefine our enterprise policies. Just as the whole of Government responded to the severe unemployment challenge we faced post the global economic downturn, we will respond to the challenge that Brexit present.  We are taking action &ndash; we remain ambitious.</p></reply>

The objective is to achieve strong export performance that is underpinned by innovation, productivity, cost effectiveness and competitiveness. We aim to diversify our export markets beyond the UK and to broaden our geographic source markets for FDI. We aim to build resilience into our economy so that we can better respond to external drivers of change over which we have no direct control.</p>  <p>  The Enterprise 2025 ambition was set in the context of the macro-economic forecasts contained in the Short-term Economic and Fiscal Outlook for the period 2014-2021 prepared by the Department of Finance. The Programme for Partnership Government affirms the ambition for the creation of 200,000 more jobs over the period 2016 to 2020.</p>  <p>  Given our close economic ties any negative development in the UK economy in the medium term could have potential implications for the Irish economy.  The ESRI analysis helps to model and quantify these impacts, despite how unprecedented Brexit is. It is important to recall that the ESRI analysis is based on a presumption of policy neutrality &ndash; that the government does not implement any policy changes in response to Brexit in the coming years. This of course is not the case. The Government and my Department have already started to implement changes with Budget 2017. Once the UK's exit negotiations are clearer, other financial measures may be added to counteract unknown consequences. </p>  <p>  Achieving the policy objective of building economic resilience as set out in Enterprise 2025 remains a priority. The UK vote does mean, however, that we need to redouble our efforts to work with our Irish owned enterprises to manage through the uncertainty, and with the FDI sector to capture opportunities for new investment.  </p>  <p>  We are taking action.  I have secured the largest ever capital budget at &euro;555 million for my Department for 2017.  I have secured sanction for 50 additional staff across the agencies that will be deployed both at home and overseas to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. While accepting that new challenges exist, we remain ambitious and I have agreed targets with IDA and Enterprise Ireland to bring employment in each of their portfolios to over 200,000 next year.  </p>  <p>  I have established a Brexit Coordination Group within the Department where my senior officials and agency CEOs meet regularly to work through what needs to be done &lsquo;on-the-ground&rsquo; to anticipate and respond to what is as yet an unknown outcome in terms of economic impact. We have increased our trade mission activity and engagement with potential investors in FDI and with our Irish owned enterprises to support them in market diversification, planning their next steps, competitiveness and innovation. </p>  <p>  In addition in Budget 2017, the Minister for Finance introduced a number of measures to help get Ireland Brexit ready including: the retention of the 9 per cent VAT rate; the extension of the Foreign Earnings Deduction and of SARP until 2020; an increase to the earned income tax credit for the self-employed; as well as the establishment of a rainy day fund. The appropriate fiscal policies that are now in place will help us to adjust to the economic effects of the UK's negotiated withdrawal from the EU.  </p>  <p>  Just as the whole of Government responded to the severe unemployment challenge we faced post the global economic downturn, we will respond to the challenges that Brexit presents.  </p></reply>

The latest data available covers the first three quarters of 2016, during which there were 489 site visits countrywide.  The breakdown by county of those visits is provided in the enclosed table. The table also shows, on a county-by-county basis, the total number of IDA Ireland client company supported jobs, the number of IDA Ireland client companies and the total number of site visits in 2015. </p><p>Since 2012, there have been 1,027 visits to Dublin and 190 visits to Cork.  This includes 204 visits to Dublin and 43 visits to Cork by quarter three this year.  Some companies depending on their requirements may visit both Dublin and Cork on the same itinerary or choose to visit one county or the other. IDA Ireland cannot provide details on clients&rsquo; itineraries for reasons of client confidentiality.  </p><p>In 2015, 57% of site visits were to locations outside of the capital, up from 43% in 2014. Figures for 2016 shows that this trend is continuing, with 58% of visits conducted so far this year being outside of Dublin. </p><p>It should be remembered that the decision by a company as to where to locate can be influenced by a number of factors. These include access to qualified talent, proximity to transport hubs, the ready supply of suitable property and the availability of business support services<b>.  </b>While IDA Ireland actively encourages its clients to locate or expand in regional locations, ultimately the final decision always rests with the company concerned. </p><p><b>IDA Ireland Jobs Statistics 2015; Site Visits 2015 and to end Quarter 3 2016 by County</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total Jobs<br /><br />2015</th><th>Number of Companies<br /><br />2015</th><th>Site Visits 2015</th><th>Site Visits end Q3 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>768</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1,165</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6,599</td><td>68</td><td>12</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>31,900</td><td>148</td><td>48</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>2,918</td><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>77,244</td><td>652</td><td>242</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>14,297</td><td>60</td><td>41</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1,931</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>10,313</td><td>22</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>650</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>97</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>423</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>8,849</td><td>52</td><td>40</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>686</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>3,245</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3,981</td><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,571</td><td>17</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>146</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>902</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>936</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>2,029</td><td>22</td><td>15</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3,518</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>5,662</td><td>33</td><td>31</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,529</td><td>16</td><td>28</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2,486</td><td>17</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,211</td><td>18</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>187,056</td><td>1,254</td><td>565</td><td>489</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The breakdown by county of such visits in 2015 and 2016 is set out in the following table.  Where clients inspect more than one site within a county during a visit, this is reflected in the statistics as one site visit only. Information on the precise number of visits to individual sites is not currently available.</p><p>To date in 2016, each county in the State has received at least one site visit.  This regional spread demonstrates IDA&rsquo;s ongoing work to increase investment in regions outside of Dublin by 30-40% by 2019, a goal that is set out in the Agency&rsquo;s strategy for the 2015-2019 period. </p><p>Statistics demonstrate that progress is being made towards this goal.

The company signs up drivers to an online platform which allows them to accept bookings via an app to carry passengers.  Drivers use their own cars, without being licensed taxi drivers.  The taxi and small public service vehicle sector is regulated in a different way in this jurisdiction.  Irish law requires that anyone carrying passengers for money must have a taxi licence.  Policy responsibility for this sector comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, a Division of the Employment Tribunal in the UK found that the drivers (who did not hold a taxi licence) were employees of the enterprise in question.  I understand that the decision is under appeal to the Superior Courts in the UK.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland, a mechanism exists for the determination of the employment status of individuals or groups.  Where an issue arises in relation to the employment status of an individual cases are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and/or the Scope Section of the Department of Social Protection for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Labour Inspectorate of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). </p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.  This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Government Departments with ICTU and IBEC.</p>  <p>  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court. WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches.  Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie.  The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service Section, which  provides information to both employers and employees in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059-9178990.</p></reply>

It is important to emphasise that we provide significant assistance to unaccompanied minors who arrive in Ireland on an unplanned basis.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2017 has provided an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  Following the Budget 2017 announcement, my Department will commence a process with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree the 2017 allocations.  Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible.</p></reply>
