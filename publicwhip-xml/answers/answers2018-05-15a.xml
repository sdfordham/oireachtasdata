The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport.  These include a postal application system, online passport application service, in person counter application facilities in Dublin and Cork and the network of Irish Missions worldwide.</p>  <p>  The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is 10 working days plus postage.  The majority of online applications are currently being processed within 5 working days, well ahead of target.  The online service currently accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to further extend this service to other categories of renewals by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  The highest proportion of applications are submitted through the An Post Passport Express postal channel.  The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently on target at 15 working days. </p>  <p>  Other types of application, which are generally submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports take longer.  Such applications must undergo additional processes including security checks.</p>  <p>  Measures taken by the Passport Service to minimise the impact of peak time application volumes on turnaround times for all categories of applications include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime for all Passport Offices. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service received sanction this year for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for appointment to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  All TCOs in this intake have been fully trained and placed since March.  These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels. </p>  <p>  The number of Full Time Equivalent staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year.  This compares to 310 Full Time Equivalent staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year.  In addition, over 20 additional permanent staff have been assigned to the Passport Service in 2018.  Targeted overtime was also sanctioned for both temporary and permanent staff in the Dublin and Cork offices to help deal with high application volumes. </p>  <p>  My Department has an extensive communication strategy to promote good practice amongst passport holders when planning to travel abroad. We regularly advise applicants of 3 golden rules:</p>  <p>  - to check the validity of the passports in advance of booking travel;</p>  <p>  -  to apply at least 6 weeks in advance of their travel plans; and</p>  <p>  -  for eligible adults renewing their passport to consider the Online Passport Renewal Service passport application online facility, which is a fast, secure way for adults renewing their passport.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-15a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051500064#WRA01800"><p>The Government has consistently pursued two key objectives with regard to supporting Irish communities in the United States: increased pathways for legal migration by Irish citizens to the US and relief for the plight of undocumented Irish citizens living in the US.</p>  <p>  In that regard, the Taoiseach discussed the issue with President Trump in the Oval Office on March 15 last and also in his meetings on Capitol Hill during this year&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit.</p>  <p>  In addition to the exchanges over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, I had previously raised the issue with then-Secretary of State Tillerson when I visited Washington DC in February, and with senior Congressional figures.  The Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also been very active on the issue.  </p>  <p>  In addition, our Embassy in Washington DC is engaged with the Administration and with contacts on Capitol Hill on an ongoing basis.  The Embassy, as well as our six Consulates across the United States, work very closely with Irish immigration centers who support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States.  In this regard, our Ambassador in Washington will hold a further regular meeting with representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers at the Embassy in Washington, DC, next week.  </p>  <p>  Through these many high-level contacts and discussions, the Government has been exploring a number of different options, including the possibility of a reciprocal agreement covering the undocumented Irish in the US, on the one hand, and US citizens looking to move to Ireland, on the other. </p>  <p>  However, this remains a very challenging issue and I do not want to raise expectations unduly.  Immigration reform has been a sensitive and indeed divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects over 11 million people. </p>  <p>  In that context, finding a solution for the thousands of undocumented Irish in the US remains a difficult task.</p>  <p>  That said, I can assure the House that the Government, its Special Envoy and our Embassy in Washington DC are continuing to give top priority to this issue, mindful of its importance to the thousands of undocumented and to their families in Ireland, and that we will spare no effort in seeking a solution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-15a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051500064#WRA02100"><p>Ireland has always consistently worked to maintain an EU and international focus on the justice and human rights issues affecting Palestinians on the ground.  This relates notably, but not solely, to the Israeli settlement enterprise and the web of policies which support it.  These include land seizures, movement restrictions, evictions, deportations and the increasing use of force to suppress protests.  These are not just evident injustices, but also act inexorably to make a political agreement more difficult, and to close &ndash; literally &ndash; the political and physical space where it might be built.</p>  <p>  Among EU actions taken in this regard are measures on labelling of settlement products, exclusion of settlements from access to EU research grants, and non-acceptance of Israeli certification for some settlement products.  We continue to look at other possible actions, but it is difficult to reach consensus in the EU on such measures at present.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, we have also explored actions with like-minded partners. Last June I signed papers for Ireland to join the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of countries which act together on land issues.  In November members of the Consortium for the first time presented Israel with a demand for compensation for humanitarian relief seized or destroyed in the West Bank.</p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States are major financial supporters of the Palestinian Authority, whose education system Ireland directly supports. We also support the Palestinian people more broadly, through humanitarian support to UNRWA and other agencies.  I believe Palestinians recognise this support, and are generally ready to consult and discuss with the EU on many issues, although of course policies and decisions remain their own.  I believe that the EU has an important role to play on the Middle East Peace Process, and I have worked at the Foreign Affairs Council to promote discussion of what we can contribute.  The urgency of this work is further underlined by the appalling loss of life in Gaza yesterday and over recent weeks.</p></reply>

To date over 160,000 adults have renewed their passport using the online facility, with an average processing time of less than 10 working days.  At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications.  My Department plans to roll out a similar service for the renewal of children&rsquo;s passports by the end of 2018.  In addition, the options available to online adult renewal applicants will be expanded, allowing for business passport applications, change of name, and permitting observations to be recorded on passport books.</p>  <p>  The online passport application service has made a major contribution to the effective management of high application volumes. As more applications are processed online, staff have been freed up and reallocated to other essential work in the Passport Service such as fraud and integrity.</p></reply>

It is many years since negotiations have taken place, and international pressure has not been strong enough to press the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships back to the negotiating table.</p>  <p>  It is in that context that the interest of the Trump Administration in brokering an agreement between the two sides has been closely watched.  The US team has been actively engaged for almost a year in meeting both sides and formulating ideas for a framework for a settlement.  This is believed to be at an advanced stage, but the time to launch the effort remains to be determined.  It may be in the next few months, but it could take longer, if the US team determines that more groundwork could help to develop, or to prepare the context for, their proposals.  I have expressed regret at the US opening of an Embassy in Jerusalem yesterday, which, in my view, makes efforts to rally all sides around a new peace initiative significantly more difficult.</p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process has been a priority for me since taking office, and the recent tragic events in Gaza have only confirmed its importance for me.  I have visited the region twice in the last year, and hope to be there again shortly. I have also been very conscious, and seen for myself, the negative trends which are acting daily to make an agreement more difficult. </p>  <p>  I have also argued strongly at EU level that the EU needs to engage with the US, to encourage their work and offer what help we can, but also to impress on them that their plan must address the aspirations and needs of both sides, and the key parameters for a settlement which the EU has consistently advocated.

In this regard, the Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional cooperation on an east-west basis through the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference (BIIGC) and the British Irish Council (BIC).  In addition, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA) brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.  These structures have shown their value and will continue to evolve in response to the changing circumstances.</p>  <p>  While post-Brexit we will no longer have the EU structures to bring us together, there is an onus on both countries to continue to develop and strengthen this bilateral relationship, an objective which may necessitate some form of structured engagement between the two Governments.  We are therefore exploring other avenues to maintain the &ldquo;habit of cooperation&rdquo; that currently exists where Ministers regularly meet their counterparts and work together in Brussels.</p>  <p>   While some discussions have taken place informally, we have not yet presented formal proposals in relation to what form this structured engagement should take.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that, since 2012, a number of bilateral meetings between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister have taken place.  In addition, a Joint Work Programme managed at official level by the heads of all government departments in both London and Dublin has been developed.  This process has the potential to be expanded and built upon in order to encompass a more comprehensive approach to bilateral engagement. </p></reply>

The escalation of these events in the last two days has been profoundly shocking.</p>  <p>  I summoned the Ambassador of Israel in Ireland to Iveagh House this morning to express my shock and dismay at what unfolded yesterday and at the numbers killed or injured, which includes many women and children.  I also made a direct request for an independent, international investigation of these events, led by the UN.</p>  <p>  Every country is entitled to defend its border, but the use of force, and particularly deadly force, must only be used as a last resort and should be proportionate to a real and immediate threat.  Israel is obviously vigilant when there are mass demonstrations close to its border with Gaza. However, Palestinians also have a legitimate right to protest peacefully, as most did.  The number and nature of casualties in recent weeks, arising from the use of live ammunition by Israeli forces, has been indefensible.  I was particularly shocked that children, and those clearly identified as medical workers and journalists, were among the huge numbers of people injured and killed. </p>  <p>  In public statements on 31 March, 9 April and again yesterday, I have called on all sides to show restraint, but particularly on Israeli forces in their use of force.  And I supported the calls by the EU and by the UN Secretary General for an independent and transparent investigation into these events.  I also addressed the situation at slightly more length in a Topical Issues debate on 9 May.</p>  <p>  I have also made clear in all my contacts in the region, even prior to these events, that the situation in Gaza is untenable.  If the cycle of violence and depression in the Strip is not ended, events of this nature will inevitably recur.  The long-standing blockade cannot be accepted as normal.  It is for this reason that, in my visits to Gaza and in my many contacts at EU and international level, I have been particularly active in trying to encourage and promote international interest and alternative approaches.  I will continue to make this a priority in my work.</p></reply>

The people and government of Bangladesh have demonstrated extraordinary generosity in receiving such a large influx of refugees.  Cox&rsquo;s Bazar now hosts the largest refugee camp in the world and 1.3 million refugees and host-community members urgently require assistance.</p>  <p>  The conditions faced by the displaced members of the Rohingya community in Bangladesh are extremely difficult and likely to deteriorate, as the Deputy has pointed out.  To this end, Ireland supports the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis. Ireland directly provided &euro;1 million in 2017 and an additional &euro;1 million has been allocated for 2018.  Our support has focused on food, shelter, water and sanitation.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response facility, we have provided 37 tonnes of hygiene, sanitation and shelter kits and deployed experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination on the ground.  In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.</p>  <p>  This support helps alleviate the immediate problems.  However the solution to the crisis must be a political one. In that regard, Ireland has consistently called for the full implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Kofi Annan-led Advisory Commission on Rakhine State as the basis for a long-term, sustainable solution.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages which have led to the mass exodus of refugees to which the Deputy has referred.</p>  <p>  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has referred to some of the reported actions committed by the Myanmar Security Forces as a &ldquo;text book example of ethnic cleansing&rdquo; while UN Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee has expressed concerns that these actions &ldquo;bear the hallmarks of genocide&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  These concerns absolutely reinforce the urgent need for the Government of Myanmar to provide access to the UN Fact Finding Mission so that these human rights violations can be fully investigated. </p></reply>

Ireland and our EU partners, and a very broad spectrum of international opinion have made clear that we believe the JCPOA was a significant diplomatic achievement, and that all parties to it should implement it in full.</p>  <p>  "We share many of the concerns which the US has expressed about other aspects of Iranian policy, but the way to address these is not to move away from the one area where significant positive progress has been made.  That remains our view, and I hope that the United States will reconsider this decision.</p>  <p>  "I hope that all other parties to the agreement, including Iran but also the EU and others, will continue to implement the agreement.  The Middle East, and the world, are safer and more stable with this agreement in operation."</p>  <p>  Similar statements were issued by the European Union, and by other partners.</p>  <p>  I have stated clearly in public that the Iran nuclear agreement was a significant diplomatic achievement in the area of non-proliferation, that it was delivering as intended, and that, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran had implemented its commitments under the agreement.  These views were clearly conveyed to the US Government on a number of occasions, including in recent weeks by President Macron and Chancellor Merkel. It is a matter of great regret that the US has taken a different approach.  </p>  <p>  Speaking for the EU, High Representative Mogherini has emphasised that the agreement was a multilateral one, and that all other signatories to it have expressed a hope that it can continue to be implemented.  The EU signatories to the agreement, and other parties, have already held initial meetings with Iran to discuss this possibility.  Ireland will fully support that objective, although the difficulties should not be underestimated.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Israel-Palestine conflict, it has been a positive factor that the US Administration is making a serious effort to develop a plan to restart political negotiations between the parties to reach an agreement.  I have engaged with that issue at EU level and directly with the US, to support that process.  Other aspects of US policy, notably the decision in December on Jerusalem, have been less helpful.</p>  <p>  I will cover the matter of a possible visit by President Trump to Ireland in a separate question.</p></reply>

This includes the holding of coroners' inquests in a manner consistent with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  In February 2016, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland put forward proposals to process outstanding legacy inquests relating to the Troubles.  The Government has been strongly supportive of the LCJ&rsquo;s proposals as a way of ensuring that those families who are still waiting for legacy inquests are not left to wait any longer.</p>  <p>  I have consistently emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced and I continue to raise this issue with the Secretary of State.  I have urged all with those with responsibilities in relation to legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland.  The Government is continuing to seek urgent progress on this matter.</p>  <p>  In this jurisdiction, the Government is taking legislative steps to facilitate further cooperation of Irish authorities with coroners' inquests in Northern Ireland through the Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Bill 2017.  This Bill is being taken forward by the Department of Justice and Equality in consultation with my Department.</p>  <p>  The Bill will also provide for co-operation of the Irish authorities with the Historical Investigations Unit, which is to be established as part of the Stormont House legacy framework.  This legislation demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland through the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  In this context, I welcome the launch on 11 May of the UK Government&rsquo;s consultation on addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s past.</p></reply>

The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport.  These include a postal application system, online passport application service, in person counter application facilities in Dublin and Cork and the network of Irish Missions worldwide.</p>  <p>  The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is 10 working days plus postage.  The majority of online applications are currently being processed within 5 working days, well ahead of target.  The online service currently accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to further extend this service to other categories of renewals by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  The highest proportion of applications are submitted through the An Post Passport Express postal channel.  The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently on target at 15 working days. </p>  <p>  Other types of application, which are generally submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports take longer.  Such applications must undergo additional processes including security checks.</p>  <p>  Measures taken by the Passport Service to minimise the impact of peak time  application volumes on turnaround times for all categories of applications include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime for all Passport Offices. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service received sanction this year for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for appointment to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  All TCOs in this intake have been fully trained and placed since March.  These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels. </p>  <p>  The number of Full Time Equivalent staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year.  This compares to 310 Full Time Equivalent staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year.  In addition, over 20 additional permanent staff have been assigned to the Passport Service in 2018.  Targeted overtime was also sanctioned for both temporary and permanent staff in the Dublin and Cork offices to help deal with high application volumes. </p>  <p>  My Department has an extensive communication strategy to promote good practice amongst passport holders when planning to travel abroad.  We regularly advise applicants of 3 golden rules:</p>  <p>  - to check the validity of the passports in advance of booking travel;</p>  <p>  -  to apply at least 6 weeks in advance of their travel plans; and</p>  <p>  -  for eligible adults renewing their passport to consider the Online Passport Renewal Service passport application online facility, which is a fast, secure way for adults renewing their passport.</p></reply>

I propose to take questions 51 and 79 together.</p><p>I refer the Deputy to the answer delivered today to his priority question, Ref No: 21310-18.</p><p>Ireland is seeking election to a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.We are one of three candidates for the two available seats in the Western Europe and Others Group regional group.  The other two candidates are Canada and Norway which, like Ireland, have strong records of engagement at the UN.</p><p>In order to be elected to the Security Council, Ireland will need to obtain the support of two-thirds of the membership of the United Nations General Assembly &ndash; approximately 129 votes of the 193 Member States &ndash; at the election that will take place in June 2020.  Our candidature was first announced in 2005 and the campaign has been building since then under successive Governments.</p><p>I am taking every opportunity to raise our candidature with representatives of Member States and to press the value of Ireland playing our role on the Council.  The President met with a range of Member State representatives during his visit to the UN last month.  The Taoiseach in his address to the Brookings Institute in Washington D.C. in March outlined the importance of an effective multilateral system to Ireland and small countries in general.  I, along with all my Cabinet colleagues, will continue to make Ireland&rsquo;s case in the period ahead.  This political engagement is being underpinned by my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic personnel.  </p><p>In making Ireland&rsquo;s case to the electorate, we are highlighting our consistent record at the UN throughout more than six decades of membership across a number of areas including peacekeeping, sustainable development, humanitarian action, disarmament and human rights.</p><p>If Ireland were to be elected to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council our fundamental approach to any agenda item would be to advocate for the core values of our foreign policy &ndash; peace and security, justice, equality and sustainability.</p></reply>

The brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime, which has included use of chemical weapons and other barbarous tactics, has cost the lives of over 400,000 people. It has led to a situation in which more than 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, over 6.6 million people are displaced inside Syria alone, and a further 5.6 million people have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The recent increase in violence, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures.  The relevant working groups in Brussels keep the impact of sanctions under review and propose options to address any unintended negative impacts where they are identified.  For example, in 2016 the EU amended the Syria sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel.  In 2017, EU Member States including Ireland consulted with NGOs to identify any further difficulties they were experiencing in carrying out humanitarian work in Syria that may have been linked to the sanctions.  Based on the feedback of the NGOs, the European Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document to clarify certain provisions of the sanctions identified as unclear by NGOs, as well as the humanitarian exemptions and derogations.  I am not aware of any report specifically having been prepared on the issue raised by the Deputy in the early months of this year.</p>  <p>  In April, EU Member States reviewed best practice guidelines on humanitarian exemptions, with a view to facilitating the work of NGOs responding to humanitarian crises, including the crisis in Syria.  It is welcome that there is work going on to implement the findings of previous reviews.  I can assure the Deputy that officials from my Department will continue to follow these discussions closely. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis, and our funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region.  Last month, Ireland pledged &euro;25 million in humanitarian support for 2018 - maintaining the same level of assistance as provided last year.  This brings Ireland&rsquo;s support since 2012 to over &euro;109 million &ndash; our largest ever response to a single crisis.</p>  <p>  Through its annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.  The EU and its member states are the single largest donor to the Syria crisis, having mobilised over &euro;10.6 billion in humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance since 2012.  We will continue to work with our EU and UN partners to ensure that this humanitarian assistance reaches those in need in a timely and effective manner. </p></reply>

Conflict, drought, severe food insecurity and the threat of famine, are causing massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s utmost priority is to ensure that life-saving assistance reaches those most in need. Since 2012, we have provided over &euro;54 million in humanitarian assistance to South Sudan.  In the first four months of this year, I have already approved &euro;3.5 million and an additional disbursement to NGO partners is under way.  Additional funding will be considered in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Our funding provides supports to those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in the region. We work with UN, Red Cross and NGO partners to ensure that our funding reaches the most vulnerable, providing lifesaving humanitarian supplies and basic services.   </p>  <p>  The Government recognises that humanitarian aid alone is not the answer; a political solution must be found to the conflict. Ireland, with EU partners supports the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) to revitalise the 2015 Peace Agreement.  We will ensure to use every opportunity to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the conflict while also insisting on respect for international humanitarian law and the safe delivery of assistance to those most in need.</p>  <p>  Departmental officials, in particular the Embassy in Addis Ababa, which has responsibility for South Sudan, will continue to monitor the situation closely and engage with local, regional and international parties to encourage progress.

Three years of war have had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights, international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life.  Three quarters of the population are estimated to require some form of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council in December last year, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever opportunities arise.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also worked in the UN system to address our grave concerns about human rights in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen.  The resolution established a group of international experts to examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the Human Rights Council later this year, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.</p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the humanitarian impact with Ministerial counterparts in Saudi Arabia and UAE on a number of occasions.  More recently, officials from my Department have passed on to the Saudi Embassy in Dublin my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access.  They also conveyed my condemnation of missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, which also have the potential to impact on civilians.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia in relation to concerns about civilians in Yemen.</p>  <p>  The food security situation in Yemen is very severe.  Last month, at a UN Pledging Conference in Geneva, Ireland pledged to provide &euro;4 million in humanitarian funding in response to the crisis in Yemen in 2018, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to Yemen to almost &euro;16.5 million since 2012.  Ireland also contributes to EU support for Yemen, and since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has contributed a total of &euro;438.2 million to Yemen, which includes humanitarian, development, stabilisation and resilience support.</p>  <p>  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict.  Ireland fully supports the efforts of the new UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement.  I hope that EU Foreign Ministers will meet with him soon, so that we can discuss how we can most effectively support his efforts.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge stronger international action, and will press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.</p></reply>

My colleague Ciar&aacute;n Cannon T.D., Minister for State for the Diaspora and International Development, led Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to the Second Brussels Conference for Syria and the region on 24-25 April.  At that conference, Ireland reaffirmed its support for the UN-led efforts to bring about a resolution of the conflict and called on the international community, particularly those with influence on the parties to the conflict, to redouble efforts to ensure a ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access.  Ireland condemned the repeated breaches of international law which have taken place in Syria, and called for full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly the use of chemical weapons.</p>  <p>  At the Brussels conference, Ireland also pledged &euro;25 million in humanitarian support for 2018 - maintaining the same level of assistance as provided last year.  This brings Ireland&rsquo;s support since 2012 to over &euro;109 million &ndash; our largest ever response to a single crisis.  Given the urgency of humanitarian needs inside Syria and across the region, over &euro;16 million of this funding has already been disbursed so far this year.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for more effective, longer-term responses for all those affected by the crisis &ndash; including displaced Syrians and host communities in the neighbouring region &ndash; Ireland also made a commitment to provide multi-annual, predictable assistance in response to the Syria crisis beyond 2018.  </p>  <p>  Through its annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.  The EU and its member states are the single largest donor to the Syria crisis, having mobilised over &euro;10.6 billion in humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance since 2012.  At the recent Brussels II Conference for Syria and the Region the EU and its Member States contributed &euro;4.8 billion out of the &euro;6.2 billion pledged until 2020, which corresponds to some 77% of all funds pledged during the Conference.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the human suffering resulting from the Syrian conflict can only be brought to an end by reaching a sustainable political solution.  I discussed the situation in Syria with my EU counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) in February, March and April. At the FAC in April, we condemned in the strongest terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and stressed the need to ensure full legal accountability for those responsible for such crimes.  I reaffirmed the need to avoid any escalation of the situation in Syria, and the importance of ensuring accountability for the use of chemical weapons.  We reaffirmed the need to reinvigorate the UN-led Geneva peace talks, to which the he EU provides direct assistance.</p></reply>

Currently, $24 billion USD in financial aid is needed to address the scale and complexity of these needs, with the clear imperative to ensure maximum positive impact for people affected by the multitude of crises, primarily driven by conflict.</p><p>Ireland prioritises the provision of needs based, principled humanitarian aid, to high profile humanitarian crises such as Syria but also to &lsquo;forgotten crises&rsquo; which receive less attention such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Eritrea.</p><p>A central part of maximising Ireland&rsquo;s response is strong and continued commitment to engaging multilaterally, including through the EU and UN. Such engagement allows Ireland to participate in deliberations and decisions on effective humanitarian assistance to those in greatest need around the world. </p><p>An example of this is Ireland&rsquo;s partnership with the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. OCHA is responsible for coordinating and leading coherent and effective responses to humanitarian crises.  OCHA manages the Central Emergency Response Fund (which releases funding rapidly to sudden onset disasters and to crises which are under-funded) and 18 Country Based Pooled Funds.  Ireland is a strong supporter of both mechanisms and a member of the OCHA Donor Support Group (ODSG).  During 2018, Ireland will become the Chair of the ODSG, working even more closely with OCHA and other donors to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p><p>Ireland also plays a strong role internationally on the protection of civilians and international humanitarian law.  For example, Ireland attended the Second Brussels conference on Syria<i></i>(organised by<i></i>the EU and UN)<i></i>where we strongly emphasised adherence to humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and called on all parties to the conflict to fulfil their responsibility to protect civilians and to allow for the safe passage of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>Promoting international peace and security in regions of conflict is a core mission of the United Nations.  By necessity UN-authorised interventions are most often required in the most sensitive war-zones.  Ireland has a strong tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts.  Ireland currently participates in six UN peacekeeping missions and twelve EU crisis management missions.  This Government is committed to ongoing participation in such peace-keeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security.  In particular, Ireland is seeking election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, which presents a valuable opportunity to influence decisions regarding the development of peace keeping missions to ensure the broadest possible protection of the most vulnerable populations. </p><p>In a time of growing humanitarian need, Ireland continues to respond, working closely with partners.  Our response is rooted in multilateralism and this coordinated response allows us to achieve a much greater impact for humanitarian aid while also seeking to protect the vulnerable.  </p></reply>

These cases are likely to be heard by the Court later this year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is important that Hungary and the European Commission will engage on these issues and that, ultimately, a resolution may be achieved, if possible, without the need for formal Court direction.</p></reply>

These negotiations are focused on all outstanding issues in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as the future relationship.</p>  <p>  In terms of the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, the UK has agreed that a backstop solution for the border will form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December . The UK has also agreed that all the issues identified in the EU draft of the Protocol will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution for the border.  Prime Minister May confirmed this in her letter to President Tusk of 19 March.  The focus is now narrowing the gaps between the two sides so that significant progress is made on agreeing the Protocol by the European Council on 28-29 June. </p>  <p>  In relation to contingency planning, co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being taken forward through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.  This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.</p>  <p>  The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agrifood sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3 bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.  There was also increased funding provided to my Department for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.  Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and upskilling teams. </p>  <p>  Longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan.  The Enterprise Strategy 2025 Renewed was recently launched and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country.</p>  <p>  Before the summer the Government will finalise a paper, building on that published in May 2017, on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them. </p></reply>

My EU colleagues and I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions at the Foreign Affairs Council, as did the Taoiseach at the European Council in October 2017.  I will continue to raise these concerns when appropriate.  I reiterate my call on the Libyan Government, and all parties, including those with de facto control of territory, to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants, and to facilitate access to detention centres by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations. </p>  <p>  The EU has increased its cooperation with UN agencies and the African Union to accelerate voluntary returns by migrants in Libya to their countries of origin, and to establish safe and legal pathways for resettlement of those in need of international protection.  As a result of the EU-AU-UN cooperation which began in November 2017, the number of migrants in official Libyan detention centres fell from an estimated 20,000 people in October 2017 to 4,000 people in March 2018.  The International Organisation for Migration (IOM), with the support of the EU and its Member States, is continuing to assist migrants inside Libyan detention centres, while increasing efforts to reach stranded migrants outside of detention.  The EU is also actively supporting alternatives to the detention of migrants in Libya.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recently opened a transit and departure facility in Tripoli to facilitate the transfer of vulnerable refugees to third countries.</p>  <p>  At the European Council in October 2017, the Taoiseach announced a doubling of Ireland&rsquo;s support to the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), to help address the root causes of migration.  In 2017, Ireland provided core funding to the UNHCR of &euro;7.5 million, and to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of &euro;9.5 million, funding which supports the work of these organisations in Libya.  In 2015, Ireland earmarked &euro;1 million in humanitarian funding specifically to support ICRC&rsquo;s work in Libya, work which includes visiting detention centres to monitor the treatment of migrants. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants will require restoration of political stability and an end to lawlessness, through the formation of a fully functioning government and a return to order throughout the country.  Ireland supports both UN mediation and regional efforts in pursuit of stabilisation in Libya.</p></reply>

Along with a group of like-minded countries, including other EU partners, the Government remains committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI).  The Programme for Government states that `we will continue to make progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of gross national product for ODA, as resources allow&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Progress towards achieving the UN target needs to be made in a sustainable and manageable way, with a critical focus on the delivery of quality interventions designed to achieve sustainable results.

This White Paper requires careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders on how to make progress on the UN target.

A strong voice for Ireland in international development will extend our global footprint, underpin our support for a rules based international order, conflict prevention and peace building, contribute to the reduction of poverty and hunger, and assist in disaster alleviation, with a focus on the impacts of climate change.</p>  <p>  The White Paper will also build on the independent work of the review of the Irish Aid programme recently completed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence (JCFATD).</p></reply>

The Government will be represented at the wreath-laying ceremony on 17 May to mark the anniversary of these tragic events by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan T.D.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights the priority that the Government attaches to the implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.  I recently met with Justice for the Forgotten to hear their views and update them on the Government&rsquo;s continuing engagement on legacy issues, including with the British Government on the D&aacute;il motions.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  </p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department.  I recently raised the issue directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley on 16 April last and my officials were in touch with the British counterparts as recently as last week. </p>  <p>  I have consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin-Monaghan atrocities.  I have also advised that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

The apparent disparity between the sentence passed, and the sentences regularly imposed on Palestinians for much less serious actions, has been widely commented upon.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to comment further on this specific case, or the appropriateness of the sentence.  I did not hear the trial and cannot assess the evidence, and nor is that my role. I will say that this case, and others, do raise serious questions about the unequal treatment of Israelis and Palestinians under the law.  This includes the different laws applicable to Israelis and Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory, the differing protections available to defendants, and the punishments imposed.</p>  <p>  I have stated regularly, including to the Israeli authorities, that Palestinians living under Israeli control should enjoy all the same protections under the law as Israel considers appropriate to its own citizens. It is clear that this is not currently the case. In particular, over many years, scrutiny of cases where deadly force is used against Palestinians has progressively diminished, and this is a matter of the most serious concern. </p></reply>

This includes the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts and the gains of the peace process, maintaining EU support for the Peace Process, supporting continued North South cooperation and ensuring there is no border infrastructure of any kind on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the December Joint Report of EU and UK negotiators, the UK committed to ensuring there would be no border infrastructure of any kind or associated checks and controls on the island of Ireland.  This commitment must now be given legal effect in the Withdrawal Agreement</p>  <p>  Work on drafting the Withdrawal Agreement has been a key focus since December.  Published on 28 February, it contains a draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the Agreement. </p>  <p>  The UK has accepted that a legally operative version of the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; for the border will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December, and that all the issues identified in the draft Protocol reflect those that must be addressed.  These were important steps forward.</p>  <p>  The current schedule of negotiations now underway between the EU and the UK is being taken forward with a view to continuing efforts to narrow the remaining gaps on the draft Protocol, among other issues. </p>  <p>  Significant progress is needed between now and the June European Council.  At this stage in the negotiations, it is more important than ever that the UK provides more detailed and realistic proposals to the EU.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s interest is in trying to achieve an outcome as close as possible to the status quo on the island.</p>  <p>  Ideally, this would be achieved through the wider EU-UK future relationship agreement.  Such an agreement would also minimise or eliminate any new frictions in East/West trade - this would also be strongly in our interests.</p>  <p>  But we need to have a backstop in case that proves not to be possible, and that backstop needs to be clearly defined as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>  <p>  All sides have been clear since the start that the unique and special situation on the island of Ireland requires unique solutions.  This was confirmed in the EU-UK Joint Progress report of last December and this is our present focus in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The importance of avoiding a hard border cannot be underestimated and the Government is acutely conscious of this.  The North South cooperation we enjoy today brings tangible benefits to the daily lives of people north and south and contributes to economic opportunity and development.  It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to mutual benefit.  It is for these reasons that there cannot be a return to border infrastructure of any kind on this island.</p></reply>

I work closely with the Taoiseach, who as a member of the European Council, provides strategic direction for our approach to the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The European Union Division in my Department is headed by a Second Secretary General with a particular focus on Brexit issues, who works closely with the Director General of the European Union Division, at Assistant Secretary level.  The Second Secretary General oversees a dedicated eight-person unit on the EU-UK negotiations in the Division, which analyses developments in the negotiations, prepares policy papers and briefing, and co-ordinates the work of our EU Missions on Brexit.  This unit is also the lead unit on contingency planning and Brexit preparedness.  The EU Division works closely with the Department&rsquo;s Ireland, UK and Americas Division, Legal Division and Trade Division, which also deal with aspects of Brexit.  There is daily coordination with the Permanent Representation in Brussels.  There is also very close contact with the Department of the Taoiseach, which serves the Taoiseach as a member of the European Council.  The most senior official dealing with Brexit in the Department of the Taoiseach is the lead negotiator in the preparation of the European Council.</p>  <p>  Maintaining frequent contact with EU partners, including the EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been a priority for Ireland throughout the Article 50 negotiations process and, as such, the Taoiseach and I both liaise with Mr. Barnier on a regular basis, as appropriate.  The Taoiseach also maintains contact with the Presidents of the European Commission and European Council.</p>  <p>  I normally represent Ireland at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50), as I did yesterday, when I also met with Mr. Barnier.  The GAC (Art. 50) has a key role in providing political oversight of the Article 50 negotiations and in preparing the work of the European Council (Art. 50), where Ireland is represented by the Taoiseach. </p></reply>

It comprehends the Government&rsquo;s policy on defence of the State from armed aggression, the defence contribution to domestic security, the defence contribution to international peace and security and a broad range of other &ldquo;non-security&rdquo; roles which the Government require the Defence Forces and Civil Defence to undertake.  It considers the defence capabilities required so that the Defence Forces can successfully deliver on the roles assigned by Government.  Finally, the White Paper also considers implementation and the actions required to ensure that defence planning and provision processes are further developed.</p><p>During scoping of the White Paper implementation programme 88 actions or projects were specifically identified. These actions represent a subset of the totality of the work being carried out as part of the implementation programme for the White Paper.  While it is currently intended to have all 88 projects initiated or completed by the end of the ten year implementation programme, work in certain areas will continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are fully implemented and to assure that positive outcomes endure and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation.</p><p>To date, 37 projects have been initiated with 10 more projects due to initiate during 2018. Of these, 5 projects have been completed and closed/transitioned to normal business with a number of other projects close to completion.  The projects which have closed to date are set out in the following table along with a summary statement:  <i></i><table><tr><th>Number</th><th>Project Name</th><th>Summary Statement</th></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Engagement with the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI), the Planning and Review Process (PARP) and the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC)</td><td>The project objective was for Ireland to continue to engage with the Partnership Interoperability Advocacy Group (formerly CFI), participate in the Planning and Review Process (PARP) and have joined the Operational Capabilities Concept, Evaluation and Feedback (OCC E&amp;amp;F) programme.<br /><br />As part of the OCC E&amp;amp;F programme, Ireland selected a unit for the inaugural force package for participation in OCC E&amp;amp;F assessment to Level 1.  This is the first step in a a two - year programme in which the unit will undertake two evaluations.  Ireland also completed the full cycle of the PARP process; (i) Partnership Goals, (ii) Partnership Survey and (iii) Partnership Assessment.  A lessons learned exercise was completed to identify and improve this process.<br /><br />Ireland continues to participate in the informal Partnership Interoperability Advocacy Group discussions and took over as PIAG Co-Chair in January 2018 for one year, and will fill the Executive Officer position from mid-2018 (July) to mid 2019.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>A review of Ireland's NRA, including those emergencies/crises that may threaten or impact on national security, will be undertaken in late 2015 by a subgroup of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.</td><td>The objective of this project was to complete a review of the National Risk Assessment (NRA) and to adopt a revised NRA.  The revised NRA for Ireland 2017 was completed and endorsed by the GTF on 8 March 2017.  It was submitted to Government on 21 November 2017 and has been forwarded to the European Commission to continue the deliberative process at an EU and National level under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.  The NRA for Ireland 2017 enables the assessment of risk management capabilities and the prioritisation of risk mitigation, which will be led by the lead Departments/Agencies responsible for the risks identified in the NRA.  This will be monitored on an on-going basis by the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, chaired by the Minister with Responsibility for Defence.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Develop a new employment support scheme with the direct involvement of the Defence Forces</td><td>The White Paper gave a commitment to develop a pilot Employee Support Scheme (ESS).  The pilot programme for the scheme was conducted by 2 Bde in Gormanston in 2016 at a total cost of &euro;259,116.  Following successful evaluation of the pilot programme, the Minister approved a three year roll out of the Scheme (2017-2019), with up to 2 iterations of the programme to be scheduled each year.  2 iterations of the programme were held in mid and late 2017 (in Limerick and Gormanston).  Another iteration is scheduled for summer 2018 (June in Cork) and the 2nd iteration for 2018 is currently provisionally scheduled for later this year in the DFTC.  Funding has been secured from the European Social Fund for the iterations of the scheme outlined in the 3 year implementation plan.  As part of the roll out, it was agreed that a full review of the Scheme be scheduled for 2020 which would comprehensively evaluate &quot;Value for Money&quot; in relation to the Scheme.  In addition to this, an interim review of the roll out of the Scheme is also underway at present.</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>Regarding Civilian Employee vacancies, the Department will in the short term, initiate a programme of targeted recruitment to address priority vacancies,  In the medium term, the Department will identify the areas that are most in need.</td><td>The project objective was to fill a number of vacancies for civilian employees. 40 posts identified at the start of the Project have now been filled and the successful applicants are now in place.  In the case of some competitions, panels were formed from which any future vacancies may be filled.</td></tr><tr><td>79</td><td>The Department (Civil Defence Branch) will take the lead role in the Government's new Inter-agency Guidance Team (IGT) being established in order to enhance liaison under the Major Emergency Management.</td><td>The project objective was to establish an Inter-Agency Guidance Team (IGT) to assist with the future development of Civil Defence.  The IGT was established in July 2016 and terms of reference were agreed.  The IGT has met on several occasions to date and further meetings will take place.  The IGT has been established in accordance with the commitment in the White Paper on Defence (2015) and is now part of the core business of the Civil Defence Branch of the Department.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

All broken windows and doors have been boarded up to prevent possible illegal access to the buildings.

In the first three months of 2018, we have witnessed some of the highest levels of displacement since the crisis began.  Over 6.6 million people are displaced inside Syria alone, and a further 5.6 million people have fled to neighbouring countries and the region. </p>  <p>  Responding to and resolving this crisis remains high on the international agenda, including for Ireland.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney T.D., discussed the situation in Syria with his EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC)in February, March and April.  At the FAC in April, Foreign Ministers condemned in the strongest terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and stressed the need to ensure full legal accountability for those responsible for such crimes.  Ministers also reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict, and the urgent need to reinvigorate the political track.  The T&aacute;naiste reaffirmed the need to avoid any escalation of the situation in Syria, and the importance of ensuring accountability for the use of chemical weapons.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks, and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.</p>  <p>  Last month, I led Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to the Second Brussels Conference for Syria and the region, at which Ireland reaffirmed its support for the UN-led efforts to bring about a resolution to the conflict and called on the international community, particularly those with influence on the parties to the conflict, to redouble efforts to ensure a ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access.</p>  <p>  Ireland condemned the repeated breaches of international law which have taken place in Syria, and called for full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly the use of chemical weapons.</p>  <p>  I personally met with key EU and UN humanitarian and political partners, including EU Commissioner Christos Stylianides and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, and reiterated concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian and protection situation in Syria, including for displaced Syrians.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response and our funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region.  At the Brussels Conference, Ireland pledged &euro;25 million in humanitarian support for 2018 - maintaining the same level of assistance as provided last year.  Given the urgency of humanitarian needs inside Syria and across the region, over &euro;16 million of this funding has already been disbursed. This brings Ireland&rsquo;s support since 2012 to over &euro;109 million &ndash; our largest ever response to a single crisis.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for more effective, longer-term responses for those affected by the crisis &ndash; including displaced Syrians and host communities in neighbouring countries &ndash; Ireland also made a commitment to provide multi-annual, predictable assistance in response to the Syria crisis beyond 2018. Such support will provide for more sustainable basic service delivery, including education for displaced children and youths. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, only a political resolution to the conflict will bring lasting relief to the suffering of the Syrian people.  In the interim, Ireland remains committed in our humanitarian response, and will continue to work with our EU and UN partners to ensure timely and effective humanitarian assistance reaches those in need.</p></reply>

This requirement also applies to the small number of adult passport applicants, whose passport was issued before 1 January 2005 and has been reported as lost, stolen or damaged and those whose passport expired more than five years ago.  If an applicant falls into one of the above mentioned categories of applicant, then their application must include a copy of their PSC.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed on 17 July 2017 to extend the requirement for a PSC to all adults in the State accessing a wide range of public services in Ireland, and this includes citizens applying for passports.  The Department is a member of a joint working group, with other relevant Departments, which is examining the business process, technical and resource implications on how this requirement can best be met and the schedule for its adoption.  There are no plans at present to extend PSC requirements for accessing services, including in relation to passport applications, to Irish citizens not resident in the State.</p>  <p>  A key principle behind the concept of the PSC is that the delivery of services is more efficient when a person&rsquo;s identity does not have to be authenticated at every transaction.  With specific reference to the issuance of passports, the introduction of the PSC requirement has allowed the Passport Service to dispense with requirements for certain additional documentation and reduces the overall volume of documentation that Irish citizens must submit when applying for a passport and is the most secure form of identity available to adult passport applicants resident in the State.  The PSC requirement is now a key resource in the Passport Service&rsquo;s efforts to combat fraud and identity theft and uphold the integrity of the Irish passport.</p>  <p>  With reference to the legal basis for the Minister to request a copy of an applicant&rsquo;s PSC, the Passports Act 2008 (as amended) provides for the issue by the Minister of passports to Irish citizens.  Section 7(1)(b) of the Passports Act 2008 requires that the Minister be satisfied as to an individual&rsquo;s identity before issuing a passport to that person. Section 7(2) provides as follows:  &ldquo;The Minister may require an applicant for a passport to provide such information as the Minister may require for the purposes of the application and to produce to him or her such documents as he or she considers necessary or expedient to enable him or her to perform the functions of the Minister under this Part.&rdquo;  It is on this basis that the Minister requires applicants to produce identity documentation.</p></reply>

This is a very important and onerous matter, and my Department takes very seriously its responsibilities in this area.

This represents a 9%<font color="#FF0000"> </font>increase on the same period last year.</p><p>The increase in demand is driven by a number of factors including a general increase in the number of Irish residents travelling abroad, a growing population, as well as a significant rise in passport applications from Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p><p>My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources are effectively deployed.  It is peak season for passport demand and the Passport Service is doing everything possible to reduce processing times for all categories of application, and in particular, those categories that are currently over target turnaround times.  In anticipation of increasing application volumes and peak season demands, a number of measures have been taken by the Passport Service to enhance processing capacity. These measures include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime. </p><p>The Passport Service received sanction this year for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for appointment to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. All TCOs in this intake have been fully trained and placed since March.  These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels.</p><p>The number of Full Time Equivalent staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year.  This compares to 310 Full Time Equivalent staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year. In addition, over 20 additional permanent staff have been assigned to the Passport Service in 2018. </p><p>The continuous implementation of service improvements has been central to my Department&rsquo;s response to increasing application volumes.  The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The award-winning online passport application service, which was launched last year, will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of high application volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service. At present, the online service accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications. It is planned to further expand the online passport application service to other renewal categories by the end of 2018.</p><p>With regard to the anticipated increases in passport applications following the UK Referendum on EU membership in June 2016, the Department commissioned research to try and better understand the potential demand for passports from Irish citizens resident in Great Britain who have not yet applied for a passport.  Interim reports have been made available and this study will continue to assist the Passport Service in formulating plans on resource requirements for the future.</p></reply>

The Second Secretary General oversees a dedicated eight-person unit on the EU-UK negotiations in the Division, which analyses developments in the negotiations, prepares policy papers and briefing, and co-ordinates the work of our EU Missions on Brexit.  This unit is also the lead unit on contingency planning and Brexit preparedness.  The EU Division works closely with the Department&rsquo;s Ireland, UK and Americas Division, Legal Division and Trade Division, which also deal with aspects of Brexit.  There is daily co-ordination with the Permanent Representation.  There is also very close contact with the Department of the Taoiseach, which serves the Taoiseach as a member of the European Council.  The most senior official dealing with Brexit in the Department of the Taoiseach is the lead negotiator in the preparation of the European Council.</p>  <p>  Maintaining frequent contact with EU partners, including the EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been a priority for Ireland throughout the Article 50 negotiations process and, as such, the Taoiseach and I both liaise with Mr. Barnier on a regular basis, as appropriate.  The Taoiseach also maintains contact with the Presidents of the European Commission and European Council.</p>  <p>  I normally represent Ireland at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50), as I did yesterday, when I also met with Mr. Barnier. The GAC (Art. 50) has a key role in providing political oversight of the Article 50 negotiations and in preparing the work of the European Council (Art. 50), where Ireland is represented by the Taoiseach. </p></reply>

As we prepare for an EU of 27 we have worked with the Nordic, Baltic and Dutch governments to increase our strategic engagement with them on the EU agenda. This has included opportunities to meet together in the margins of different Council formations, stronger bilateral engagement and, as appropriate, joint initiatives. I hosted one such dinner for Foreign Ministers of Nordic and Baltic Member States, and my Dutch counterpart, in Luxembourg on 15 April.</p>  <p>  At the same time we have been working to strengthen and diversify our relationships with all our EU partners.  This has involved an increased range and intensity of inward and outward visits at Prime Ministerial, Ministerial and senior official level to discuss key issues and challenges on the EU agenda and to ensure that our perspectives and priorities are understood.

This is a tragedy which has caused untold misery for millions of ordinary Syrians, and which has had a serious impact on neighbouring countries.  The long-running conflict in Syria, and the misery that it has caused, has been further prolonged by the military support provided to the Assad regime.  There are significant Iranian forces in Syria, which have been assisting the regime in the violent suppression of its own people . This is unhelpful and unwelcome.  It is also quite clear that Russia&rsquo;s support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people.  Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians. </p>  <p>  This conflict has had a negative impact right across the region, with many of Syria&rsquo;s neighbours facing heightened security threats, as well as being the hosts to millions of Syrian people fleeing the conflict. We understand that these countries have concerns about the conflict raging on their borders and about the potential spill-over of violence. I call on all regional actors, and indeed all involved in the Syria conflict, to show restraint and avoid any escalation, which could further undermine regional stability, as well as adding to the suffering of civilians.</p>  <p>  The Syria crisis is high on the EU agenda.  I discussed the situation in Syria with my EU counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) in February, March and April.  At the FAC in April, we condemned in the strongest terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and stressed the need to ensure full legal accountability for those responsible for such crimes.  We also reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict, and the urgent need to reinvigorate the political track. I reaffirmed the need to avoid any escalation of the situation in Syria, and the importance of ensuring accountability for the use of chemical weapons. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive, sustainable, Syrian-owned and Syrian-led resolution to the conflict will be required to provide lasting relief to this terrible suffering.  UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.  Ireland and the EU fully support the UN-led efforts to resolve this conflict.</p></reply>

The Government will be represented at the wreath-laying ceremony on 17 May to mark the anniversary of these tragic events by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan T.D.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights the priority that the Government attaches to the implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.  I recently met with Justice for the Forgotten to hear their views and update them on the Government&rsquo;s continuing engagement on legacy issues, including with the British Government on the D&aacute;il motions.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  </p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department.  I recently raised the issue directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley on 16 April last and my officials were in touch with the British counterparts as recently as last week. </p>  <p>  I have consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin-Monaghan atrocities.  I have also advised that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

Ireland and our EU partners, and a very broad spectrum of international opinion have made clear that we believe the JCPOA was a significant diplomatic achievement, and that all parties to it should implement it in full.</p><p>&quot;We share many of the concerns which the US has expressed about other aspects of Iranian policy, but the way to address these is not to move away from the one area where significant positive progress has been made.  That remains our view, and I hope that the United States will reconsider this decision.</p><p>&quot;I hope that all other parties to the agreement, including Iran but also the EU and others, will continue to implement the agreement.  The Middle East, and the world, are safer and more stable with this agreement in operation.&quot;</p><p>Similar statements were issued by the European Union, and by other partners.  In recent days, I have discussed these developments with my French counterpart, during his visit to Dublin.</p><p>The possibility and implications of US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement had been discussed at each of the most recent meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, and I have no doubt will be discussed at the next Council on 28 May.  Ministers will need to discuss the prospects for continued implementation of the agreement, which all of the other parties to it have said they hope to do.

It has been discussed at many recent meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, and EU Ministers discussed the issue with Prime Minister Netanyahu in the margins of the December 2017 Foreign Affairs Council, and with President Abbas in the margin of the January 2018 Council.</p>  <p>  At present, prospects for a re-start of negotiations centre on the proposals being developed by the United States.  I have engaged with the US Middle East team to encourage this initiative, and to highlight some of the key issues which it will have to address, if it is to be successful.  I have encouraged my EU colleagues to take a similar approach. Unfortunately however, the US opening of its Embassy in Jerusalem makes bringing the relevant parties together around a peace initiative more difficult.  I have conveyed this view to both US and Israeli interlocutors.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of the need to support Palestinians affected by this long-running conflict, not just in Gaza and the West Bank, but throughout the region, where agencies such as UNRWA do vital work.  To date in 2018, Ireland has provided &euro;4.25 million for UNRWA&rsquo;s Programme Budget, which supports services and assistance to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees, including in Gaza. </p>  <p>  I have paid particular attention in my work to the problems of Gaza, seeking both to maintain international focus on the issue and to work on solutions to change the dynamic there and to begin to improve conditions.  The appalling events of yesterday and recent weeks, which have seen very significant numbers killed or injured along Gaza&rsquo;s borders, underlines the urgency of these efforts.</p>  <p>  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict will continue to be a focus of my work, and I hope to visit the region again next month.</p></reply>

For example, as part of the UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review of Israel earlier this year, Ireland raised concerns about Israel&rsquo;s extensive use of administrative detention without formal charge.  I also raised concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities when I visited the country in January. </p>  <p>  However, my Department does not have the capacity to keep track of the total numbers or categories of prisoners in other jurisdictions, figures which are likely to change from day to day, and which may not be publicly available.

The stability of the Western Balkans is important for the security of the EU and the region is a priority for the Bulgarian Presidency.  A Strategy for the Western Balkans was published in February, and the Taoiseach will attend an EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia on 17 May where the main focus of discussion will be connectivity, which is essential for the future development of the countries of the region.</p><p>The countries of the Western Balkans have a European perspective, but reforms are required across a wide range of areas, particularly in the rule of law and fundamental freedoms, to reach the high standards set out in the chapters of the <i>acquis communautaire.</i></p><p>Two of the countries of the Western Balkans have opened formal accession negotiations with the European Union: Montenegro and Serbia.  Thirty chapters (out of a total of 35) have been opened with Montenegro; of these three have already been provisionally closed.  Twelve chapters have been opened with Serbia and two have been provisionally closed. </p><p>The European Commission published country reports on each of the countries of the Western Balkans in April.  These reports detail the &lsquo;state of play&rsquo;, assess progress made and make recommendations for future action, and will form the basis for a discussion by Ministers at the General Affairs Council in June. </p><p>The EU endeavours to foster good relations in all of its engagement with the Western Balkans, through the provision of pre-accession funding, by facilitating the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue and in its intense engagement with the candidate countries which have a &lsquo;European Perspective&rsquo; but which have not yet opened formal negotiations, namely Albania and Macedonia, as well as the potential candidate countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. </p><p>Ireland is a strong supporter of the enlargement policy of the EU, believing that the accession process is a transformative driver for peace and stability.  We also believe that there can be no shortcuts to membership, and that all standards and conditions must be met.</p></reply>

In light of this, the Government has been working with the British Government to consider means by which we can support the political process, in accordance with the Agreement, in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  I am in very regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, as we seek a way beyond the current impasse.  I met with Secretary of State Bradley on 3 May and we spoke further by phone last week, on 9 May.  Over the last few weeks, the Secretary of State and I have each been conducting a round of contacts with the Northern Ireland political parties, to hear their views on how at this stage the two Governments can support the political process, in accordance with the Agreement.  All parties have re-affirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and provided views on their key concerns and issues to be addressed in seeking a way forward. </p>  <p>  In light of these consultations, the Secretary of State and I will consider how best the two Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, can chart a way forward that will give the best prospects for getting the devolved institutions operating again without delay.  I will continue to engage intensively, working with Secretary of State Bradley and the leaders of all of the political parties, until that is achieved.  </p></reply>

These negotiations are focused on all outstanding issues in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as the future relationship.</p>  <p>  The UK has agreed that a backstop solution for the border will form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December.  The UK has also agreed that all the issues identified in the EU draft of the Protocol will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution for the border.</p>  <p>  Prime Minister May confirmed this in her letter to President Tusk of 19 March, in addition to reiterating the UK's commitment last December to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including the overarching guarantee on avoiding a hard border. </p>  <p>  The Government has always maintained that the backstop will apply unless and until another solution is found.  While we share Prime Minister May's preference to resolve these issues through the wider agreement on the EU's future relationship with the UK, it is crucial that we have certainty in all scenarios on the commitments already made on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is also the case that the UK&rsquo;s repeatedly stated positions, including its wish to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, limit the depth of the future partnership and have consequences for the ability of the EU-UK future relationship agreement to deliver on all the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK with regard to protecting North South cooperation, the all island economy and the Good Friday Agreement, including avoiding a hard border. </p>  <p>  Negotiations are ongoing, including detailed discussions between the EU and the UK on issues relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Significantly more progress is needed on agreeing the Protocol, including the backstop on avoiding a hard border, ahead of the June European Council.</p>  <p>  The EU has always made clear that &ldquo;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo; and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.  The European Council is therefore continuing to follow the negotiations closely and will return in particular to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the Protocol, and to the framework for the future relationship at its next meeting in June.  It is essential that real and substantial progress be made by the June European Council meeting.</p>  <p>  The objective of the negotiators is that the full legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, and a detailed political declaration on the framework for the future relationship, should be concluded by the October European Council. This limited timeframe underlines the urgency of the work ahead in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-15a.265.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051500069#WRF02500"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance targets the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations experiencing disasters and emergencies.  Humanitarian crises worldwide are monitored, with decisions on funding informed by an annual categorisation of need assessment.  This identifies the highest priorities for the allocation of humanitarian resources and highlights areas where early funding is required.  This helps ensure that aid goes where needs are greatest.  Ireland focuses in particular on forgotten and underfunded crises, providing assistance where others are not.  Monitoring of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance is undertaken through robust grant management and report appraisal processes, including monitoring visits to programmes being implemented by our partner organisations in crisis countries, where the humanitarian situation on the ground allows.  This year, monitoring visits have taken place to programmes in Somalia, Cameroon and Tanzania, with further visits planned in 2018.</p>  <p>  Ireland also advocates strongly within the EU for humanitarian aid to be provided to those that are most vulnerable, as well as for EU aid to be managed in the most effective and efficient way possible so that it has the maximum effect.  Correct implementation of humanitarian aid managed by the EU is ensured by several layers of checks and monitoring, also including regular field visits to projects.  Regular evaluations are undertaken, focusing on major country operations, partners and thematic issues. The results of these evaluations are publicly available.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation worldwide closely in order to ensure that humanitarian support is provided to the most severe ongoing crises and to those in most need. We will also react to sudden-onset crises or sudden spikes in humanitarian need due to conflict or natural disasters, while remaining committed to providing assistance to crises that are forgotten by others.  Thus far this year Ireland has provided over &euro;16 million to the Syria humanitarian response, over &euro;4 million to the response for the Democratic Republic of Congo and &euro;4 million to the Yemen response.  Substantial support has also been provided to Somalia, the Central African Republic and Sudan, amongst other situations.  Looking forward, it is clear that the ongoing Rohingya crisis and ongoing food insecurity in the Sahel and in the Lake Chad basin will also require our continued assistance in 2018.  We believe that it is not only the quantity of assistance but the quality of it that is critical, and will continue to advocate at the EU and other fora on improving the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance, including through using innovative funding mechanisms.  Ireland will also continue to work to ensure that Irish and EU assistance reaches those in greatest need in the most efficient and effective way possible, with robust monitoring mechanisms in place to ensure this.</p></reply>

There is no general agreement however on the situations which give rise to the greatest concern globally.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to engaging with global challenges is set out in The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World.  We work to achieve a fairer, more just, more secure and more sustainable world through our development and conflict resolution programmes; our human rights, peacekeeping, disarmament and security policies; and growing engagement with emerging global issues including climate change.  The Global Island also sets out how Ireland&rsquo;s voice and influence can be amplified through engagement with the EU and the UN.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Global Strategy sets out a vision for foreign and security policy.  The Strategy commits the European Union to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law around the world.  This includes efforts to strengthen global governance and cooperative regional orders.  For these purposes, the EU is implementing an integrated approach to conflicts and crises drawing on the full array of available instruments including political and diplomatic activities; economic development assistance and trade policies; capacity building for rule of law as well as peace-keeping.  Implementation of the Global Strategy is ongoing and is discussed regularly by Ministers at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. </p></reply>

This approach has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by our EU27 partners and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position.  As the negotiations enter an important phase over the coming weeks and months, continuing such engagement with EU partners, both at political and official level, will remain a key priority.</p><p>In my meetings with EU partners to date, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  In so doing, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.</p><p>We have made clear to EU partners, to third countries, and to business and civil society, that Ireland&rsquo;s place is at the heart of the European Union.

Tens of thousands of children are recruited and used as soldiers in conflicts around the world. Since 2002, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has issued an annual report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children.  The most recent report, published in August 2017, cites groups operating in eight African countries; namely the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria and Mali. In 2016, the recruitment and use of children documented in Somalia more than doubled compared with 2015. In South Sudan, 1,022 children were recruited and used as child soldiers.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and use of children as soldiers is explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law and human rights law. In 1999, the UN Security Council passed its first Resolution, UNSCR 1261, on the impact of armed conflict on children and condemned violations in that context.  In the same year, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child entered into force. Article 22 of the Charter sets out a prohibition on the recruitment and direct participation in hostilities of any person under the age of 18 years.</p>  <p>  Ever since, the Security Council has established important tools to strengthen child protection and to strengthen implementation of international standards, including the position of UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict who investigates and develops best practices to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the eradication of the recruitment and use of child soldiers is highlighted in our Policy for International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;.  In addition to the focus in our development programme on addressing the socio-economic causes which can lead to conflict, and the recruitment of child soldiers, Ireland also supports more targeted interventions by working with organizations such as UNICEF, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and institutions such as the International Criminal Court. </p></reply>

In the Rome Declaration of March last year, EU Heads of State and Government pledged &lsquo;to listen and respond to the concerns expressed by our citizens&rsquo; and to &ldquo;address the challenges of a rapidly changing world.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Having gone through a series of crises in recent years, including the Eurozone crisis, terror attacks, migration and Brexit, the EU is now moving in a more positive direction characterised by economic growth across all member states. To maintain this impetus we need to ensure that the EU is delivering practical improvements to the lives of citizens through policies to promote jobs and growth and by addressing internal and external challenges such as migration and international terrorism. Completion of the single market and Digital Single Market &ndash; which Ireland has been pushing &ndash; are two ways of doing that.   </p>  <p>  The public launch of the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe by the Taoiseach in November marked the formal start of a process designed to engage the Irish public directly in a debate on the kind of Europe they want to see evolve.  The aim of this process, which culminated in the National Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on 9 May, has been to raise awareness of the issues involved and to encourage participation in the debate.  We have been impressed by the level of engagement at all of the events, and will use this engagement process to formulate Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the wider European debate and specifically to President Tusk&rsquo;s Leaders&rsquo; Agenda.  Similar public outreach initiatives to engage citizens are taking place in many countries across the EU.</p>  <p>  Engaging meaningfully with citizens across the Union; listening and responding to their concerns is the best means of ensuring support for our work on EU issues. </p></reply>

The relief can generally be claimed for a maximum period of five consecutive years, commencing with the year of first entitlement. </p><p>The aim of SARP is to reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals already employed by their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of the employer or an associated company, thereby facilitating the creation of jobs and the development and expansion of business in Ireland.  The intention is that the recipients of SARP relief will assist with the establishment of additional functions for their employers in Ireland and, due to a transfer of skills, these functions will be able to operate without the assistance of SARP after a period. SARP is limited to existing overseas employees of companies and is not available to newly-recruited individuals.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that for each of the years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (the most recent year for which figures are available) the following table sets out the number of persons who availed of SARP and the amounts claimed:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Claimants</th><th>Total Claimed &euro;,000</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>11</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>121</td><td>1,900</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>302</td><td>5,900</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>586</td><td>9,500</td></tr></table></p><p>As part of my department&rsquo;s review of SARP in 2014, proposals to include non-resident recruits rather than restricting it to employees moving within an organisation were considered. However, the review found that to apply SARP to such hirees could result in individuals from outside the State being cheaper to employ than Irish residents, thereby resulting in the potential displacement of employment for Irish residents in favour of non-resident job-seekers. </p><p>The relief will close to new entrants at the end of 2020 and the question of any extension of the scheme beyond 2020 is a matter that I will consider closer to the time.</p><p>Finally, comprehensive guidance notes on this relief can be found on the Revenue website using the following link - Tax and Duty Manual 34-00-10.I am also advised by Revenue that detailed reports regarding the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) are published on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; webpage located at:</p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/research/statistical-reports/special-asignee-relief-programme.aspx.</p><p>These reports provide information on the conditions, eligibility and the calculation of the relief and statistics covering the uptake of the relief and the cost to the Exchequer up from 2012 to 2015. </p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that its recent updating of guidance on the tax position of foreign assignees followed extensive consultation by Revenue with practitioner representatives.  This included detailed discussions in early March on draft text which had been circulated for comment to the practitioner representatives in December 2017.  </p>  <p>  In its latest guidance, I am advised that Revenue has significantly reduced the burden for employers.  In particular, this has been achieved by: </p>  <p>  -  in the case of assignees from a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement (DTA), the extension of the previous workday test for &lsquo;automatic release&rsquo; from the obligation to operate PAYE from 30 days to 60 days,</p>  <p>  -  the introduction of a new two year test, rather than a more restrictive one year test,  </p>  <p>  -  retention of the 30 day test for non-DTA assignees and its extension to cover a two year period, and </p>  <p>  -  the guidance providing greater clarity for employers and practitioners.</p>  <p>  There has been no change in the requirement for employers to track the number of days worked in Ireland by their foreign assignees.  However, the 21 day deadline for employers to apply to Revenue for release from the obligation to operate PAYE has been extended to 30 days.  This will facilitate a more practical approach by employers.  At the request of practitioner representatives, numerous new examples of the practical operation of the guidance have been provided in the Manual.  </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that an individual&rsquo;s liability to income tax and an employer&rsquo;s obligation to operate PAYE are two separate issues.  Under the terms of Revenue&rsquo;s guidance, and where it is appropriate, Revenue will release an employer from the obligation to operate the PAYE system in circumstances where the assignee will not have a tax liability in the State in respect of his or her employment income.</p></reply>

The nominal amounts relating to these pre-commitments were set out in Table 1.3 on page 9 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report (MYER) 2017, with &euro;0.4 billion for demographics.</p><p>In relation to current expenditure there are pre-commitments that arose after the SES of &euro;0.7 billion that would need to be funded from the current expenditure fiscal space amount or from savings/reprioritisations. </p><p>There is a cost of &euro;0.4 billion arising in 2019 from the Public Services Stability Agreement.  This amount was not included as pre-committed expenditure in the SES or the MYER as the agreement at that stage was subject to ratification by the membership of the Public Service Unions and Staff Associations.</p><p>In addition, as outlined in the Expenditure Report 2018, there was a cost estimated, at that time, of &euro;0.2 billion in respect of the carryover impact of certain Budget 2018 measures that would need to be met from the available resources for 2019 or from savings/reprioritisation.  The current estimate of the carryover impact into 2019 is &euro;0.3 billion.  This estimated carryover impact will be reviewed in the context of this year&rsquo;s MYER to take account of expenditure developments during the first half of this year.</p><p>The Stability Programme Update (April) 2018 provides for an increase of &euro;2.8 billion in Voted Expenditure, including pre-committed expenditure of &euro;2.6 billion for next year.  This pre-committed expenditure was composed of:</p><p>-  &euro;1.5 billion (National Development Plan - capital related)</p><p>-  &euro;0.4 billion (to provide for the public sector pay agreement)</p><p>-  &euro;0.4 billion (to provide for demographics)</p><p>-  &euro;0.3 billion (to provide for the carryover costs next year of measures introduced in the budget for this year).</p><p>After providing for the increase of &euro;2.8 billion in Voted Expenditure there is a deficit of 0.1 per cent of GDP projected for next year.</p><p>The available parameters will become clearer in the next couple of weeks (the Commission recently published its spring forecasts and these are an important input). </p><p>I note that the IMF, in its press briefing on the conclusion of the 2018 Article IV mission, have stated that the focus on fiscal space is not helpful and a good stance on fiscal policy is needed.</p><p>To that end, as I have stated on numerous occasions, the Government will formulate budgetary policy based on what is right for the economy and not what is legally permissible. The Government will not adopt pro-cyclical policies that jeopardise the sustainability of our public finances and our future living standards.</p></reply>

These are the Rural, Urban, Innovation and Climate Action Funds. The funds will be partly covered by an unallocated capital reserve in the first instance, leaving an additional cost, which will both pre-commit unallocated available resources and worsen the EBR.</p><p>The net nominal EBR increase resulting from the three funds is set out in the last row of the following table:<table><tr><th>New Funds, &euro; millions</th><th><div>2019</div></th><th><div>2020</div></th><th><div>2021</div></th></tr><tr><td>Rural</td><td><div>55</div></td><td><div>80</div></td><td><div>80</div></td></tr><tr><td>Urban</td><td><div>100</div></td><td><div>120</div></td><td><div>150</div></td></tr><tr><td>Innovation</td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>40</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>175</div></td><td><div>230</div></td><td><div>270</div></td></tr><tr><td>Less Capital Reserve</td><td><div>-98</div></td><td><div>-136</div></td><td><div>-94</div></td></tr><tr><td>Net Increase</td><td><div>77</div></td><td><div>94</div></td><td><div>176</div></td></tr></table></p><p>As the Climate Action Fund, set out in the following table, will be funded from the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) levy, it will have no impact on Voted Expenditure or the EBR.<table><tr><th>&euro; millions</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Climate Action Fund</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr></table>In calculating the impact under the Expenditure Benchmark, it is assumed that both the Urban and Rural Funds will be recorded as gross fixed capital formation (i.e. subject to &lsquo;capital smoothing&rsquo; over four years) and that the Innovation and Climate Action Funds will be treated as capital grants (i.e. not smoothed). A further assumption is that the funding from the capital reserve will offset the Rural and Urban Funds.</p><p>Should the operation of the funds change these assumptions then the figures that follow will need to be amended.</p><p>The cost of the four funds is therefore:<table><tr><th>&euro; millions</th><th><div>2019</div></th><th><div>2020</div></th><th><div>2021</div></th></tr><tr><td>Available resources Used</td><td><div>54</div></td><td><div>36</div></td><td><div>54</div></td></tr></table></p><p>I would stress once again that, notwithstanding the legal position, budgetary policy will be formulated on the basis of what is right for the economy and pro-cyclical policies of the past will not be adopted.</p></reply>

This is because any amounts restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap would be available for carry forward and utilisation in a subsequent accounting period, subject to the application of the cap in that period.  Therefore no additional tax revenue would be raised in the long-term through the Deputy's proposal.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in the short-term there could be a large theoretical cash-flow gain, tentatively estimated to be in the region of &euro;750m, from the introduction of an 80 per cent cap on intangible assets onshored between 2015 and 11 October 2017.  It is important to be clear that such a change would not lead to more tax overall and this simply a timing matter - to present this as additional tax for the exchequer would not be correct.  I do not wish to repeat the mistakes of the past by increasing expenditure through unsustainable tax changes.  I would also note that this estimate is on the basis of assuming no behavioural change on the part of the companies involved.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis such that they apply only from the date on which they have legal effect. </p>  <p>  The 80% cap on Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets was re-introduced in Finance Bill 2017 for all assets onshored from 11 October 2017. </p></reply>

It allows for losses incurred in the course of business to be accounted for when calculating tax liabilities.  Loss relief for corporation tax is a long standing feature of the Irish Corporate Tax system and is a standard feature of Corporation Tax systems in all OECD countries.  </p>  <p>  Section 396C of the TCA 1997 previously restricted losses for NAMA participating institutions to offset losses against 50% of taxable profits in a given year.  At the time of its introduction the Government had limited involvement in the banking system. However, by Finance Bill 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose as, due to the substantial holdings that the State had by that time acquired in the banking sector (99.8% AIB and 15% of Bank of Ireland at the time), the restriction was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests.</p>  <p>  Section 396C was repealed to reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital and to protect the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments.  With the removal of Section 396C, AIB and BOI were restored to the same position as other Irish corporates including other Irish banks which effectively levelled the playing field.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to quantify the estimated additional corporation tax revenue from the measures referred to by the Deputy, as this would depend on the future profitability of the banks. Nevertheless, as I have previously stated, I do not intend to change how tax losses are currently taxed for Irish banks, including those that were bailed out by the State, as I believe there could be consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfil other objectives in respect of the Irish banking system.  </p>  <p>  There would be a material negative impact on the valuation of the States investments from any change in tax treatment of accumulated losses where the banks are concerned.  It is critically important to understand that the State is actually getting value today from these deferred tax assets through our share sales. </p>  <p>  Despite the scale of losses accumulated the banks are contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy.  To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In Budget 2017, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It was anticipated that the bank levy could be expected to raise &euro;750 million over five years.</p>  <p>  At Committee Stage of Finance Act 2017 I agreed that my officials will produce a report on the effect on limiting tax reliefs on losses carried forward for banks.  It is envisaged that this report will be submitted to the FinPer Committee in June 2018.</p></reply>

This took place during 2016, including a public consultation to ascertain the views of stakeholders.  Following on from this, it was decided to retain the existing DIRT-based calculation methodology, but to update the base year and corresponding levy rate, in order to protect the &euro;150 million annual yield.  Minister Noonan committed to the introduction of a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020, and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021.  The levy rate may require updating when the base year changes to protect the &euro;150 million annual yield.  </p>  <p>  The current rate is 59% of the amount paid in DIRT by accounts within each institution in 2015. </p>  <p>  Increasing the current rate by 10 percentage points would give a rate of 69%.  If everything else was held equal, a rate of 69% would give an approximate yield of &euro;175 million. </p>  <p>  Increasing the current rate by 10% would give a rate of 64.9%.  If everything else was held equal, a rate of 64.9% would give an approximate yield of &euro;165 million. </p></reply>

Section 32D and 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, provide that the Central Bank Commission may make regulations relating to the imposition of levies and fees on the financial services sector in respect of the recoupment of the costs of financial regulation. </p>  <p>  As it stands, the financial services industry currently funds 65% of the costs incurred by the Central Bank for financial regulation, with certain exceptions including the banks which had participated in the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme, namely AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, which are required to fund 100% of the Central Bank's regulatory costs. Credit Unions currently contribute approximately 8% to the cost of their regulation.</p>  <p>  The industry funding levies currently recoup 65% of the costs of financial regulation from industry (with certain sectoral exceptions).  This means that the subvention from the Central Bank amounts to approximately 35% of the total cost. What this translates to in monetary terms will be determined by the resources required by the Bank to discharge its legal responsibilities during a given year. </p>  <p>  The total cost of financial regulation in 2017 was approximately &euro;171 million; industry levies were approximately &euro;95 million with the remainder funded by way of subvention by the Bank. Therefore in the order of &euro;76 million of the Central Bank's 2017 surplus income was redirected to make up for the difference between the costs of regulation and the funding received from the financial services industry, which would otherwise have been surrendered to the Exchequer.  As a point of reference, the Central Bank surplus income for 2017 surrendered to the Exchequer amounted to &euro;2,101 million. </p></reply>

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.</p>  <p>  Property rental income and gains arising are exempt from tax within the REIT and are taxed at the investor level when distributed.  The legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.  The REIT is subject to corporation tax on income and gains not arising from the property rental business of the REIT.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that information in respect of potential future capital gains from the sale of property of REITs is unavailable, I am therefore unable to provide an accurate estimate of the potential revenue to be obtained from the ending of the exemption. It is also worth noting that REITs are specifically designed to focus on the long-term holding of income producing property and contain provisions to encourage the re-investment of property sale proceeds in new property rental assets.  REITs are not designed to hold development activities, or as a vehicle for short term speculative gains.</p>  <p>  With regard to withholding tax on REIT dividends, Deputies will be aware that, in the absence of any other provisions, foreign REIT shareholders in treaty partner countries would not have had any liability to Irish tax on REIT dividends.  In order to ensure that tax from foreign investors is retained, a Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at the standard rate of tax (20%) was legislated for to specifically apply to REIT dividends.  Foreign investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.  The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that state.</p>  <p>  Due to this interaction with tax treaty reliefs, and also taking into account the fact that information in respect of potential future annual distributions from REITs to investors is not available, an accurate estimate of the potential revenue from an increase in the withholding tax rate applicable to any such distributions cannot be made.  </p></reply>

In general terms, the regime provides that profits arising to Irish funds from Irish property remain within the charge to Irish tax.  An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25 per cent or more of the value of the assets of the undertakings is derived from real estate assets in the State.  Where a unit holder receives value from the IREF, an IREF withholding tax of 20% will generally apply.  There are a number of exceptions from the operation of this withholding tax such as for pension schemes and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.  </p>  <p>  On introduction, the IREF regime provided for an exemption from IREF withholding tax on the distribution of profits that arose from holding Irish land or buildings for more than 5 years.  Finance Act 2017 introduced legislation to remove the CGT exemption within the IREF regime from 1 Jan 2019.  This amendment was not revenue raising in nature, but designed to ensure that tax provisions did not encourage land hoarding.</p>  <p>  The first payment of IREF withholding tax and the filing date for the first return for the majority of these funds is 30 July 2018.  At that point, depending on the number of IREFs, it may be possible to identify the quantum of profits from long term land holdings that were distributed during 2017. </p>  <p>  However, I am advised by Revenue that information in relation to the potential sale of property held by an IREF or future distributions made by IREFs is not available to enable an accurate estimate of the potential revenue from the changes mentioned by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The threshold was initially set at &euro;5 million, which was subsequently reduced to &euro;2.3 million in 2010 and further reduced in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million with effect from 1 January 2014.</p>  <p>  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits in pension schemes are not generally required to be supplied to either the Revenue Commissioners or to my Department by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements. The estimate of the yield expected to arise from the changes to the SFT regime introduced in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013 referred to above was arrived at following considerable internal work over a period by my Department involving, among other things, data gathering and consultation with private sector sources relating to the specific changes to be made. </p>  <p>  There is no readily available underlying data or methodology on which to base reliable estimates of the revenue that would arise from further changes to the SFT of the scale envisaged in the question. </p></reply>

Mortgage Interest Relief is a tax relief based on the amount of interest paid in a tax year on a qualifying mortgage loan taken out between 2004 and 2012.  The effect of the measure introduced in Finance Act 2017 was to provide for 75% of the relief in 2018, 50% of the relief in 2019 and 25% of the relief in 2020.</p>  <p>-  Four measures have sunset clauses dated 31 December 2018 (cost figures relate to the last year published):</p>  <p>  -  HRI (Home Renovation Incentive) (s.477B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997): Direct cost to the Exchequer was &euro;21.4m in 2014, note that HRI relief is split into two years hence the lag in statistics);</p>  <p>  -  Start Your Own Business (s.472AA of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1977): Direct cost to the Exchequer was &euro;15.2m in 2015;</p>  <p>  -  Stock Relief (s.666 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997) and Stock Relief for Young Trained Farmers (s.667B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997): Direct cost to the Exchequer was &euro;6.1m in 2015;</p>  <p>  -  Transfers of agricultural land to young trained farmers (s.81AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999): Direct cost to the Exchequer was &euro;4.6m in 2016.</p>  <p>  -  The Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) rate is set to decrease by 2% in 2019 to 35% and by a further 2% in 2020 to 33% (this was provided for in section 21 of the Finance Act 2016).</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that a Charities VAT compensation scheme was announced during Budget 2018.  This will take effect from 1 January 2018 but will be paid one year in arrears i.e. in 2019, charities will be able to reclaim some element of the VAT costs arising in 2018.  Charities will be entitled to a refund of a proportion of their VAT costs based on the level of non-public funding they receive.  A capped fund of &euro;5 million will be available to the scheme in 2019. It is intended that the relevant legislative instrument to give legal effect to this provision will be introduced in 2018.</p>  <p>  The effect of the above measures on fiscal space, along with other discretionary revenue measures are set out in Table A6 of the Stability Programme Update, which shows the net impact in 2019 as 0.0% of GDP.</p></reply>

The Report is the second in a series of reports designed to address Recommendation 12 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which aim to increase the level of transparency of the insurance sector in advance of the establishment of the National Claims Information Database.  </p><p>This Report provides information on overall ultimate claims costs trends from 2011 to 2016 for Insurance Ireland companies representing about 90% of the Irish motor insurance market.  Ultimate claim costs are made up of paid claims (including partial payments), reserves/estimates of the amount yet to be paid and a further provision calculated by actuaries to allow for claims and information not yet reported at the valuation date.  The Report breaks the information on ultimate claims costs trends down into Third Party Injury ultimate claims costs and Non-Injury ultimate claims costs including claims cost arising from damage, fire and theft, as well as windscreen claims.  In addition, it provides details on earned premium income and exposure in the sector for the same years.  </p><p>This Report represents a more detailed breakdown of claims costs compared with the first report and is another important step towards the establishment of the National Claims Information Database.  </p><p>In relation to the second part of the question, I note that the Deputy is highlighting the premiums faced by those in particular professions, musicians in the example referenced. </p><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  </p><p>In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will use a combination of rating factors, which include the age and type of the vehicle, as well as the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, the profession of the driver and how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to particular categories, different insurance companies will have different views.</p></reply>

The AEO programme, which aims to enhance international supply chain security and to facilitate legitimate trade, is open to all supply chain actors.</p><p>An AEO is an economic operator who is deemed reliable in the context of their customs related operations, and therefore, is entitled to enjoy benefits throughout the EU.  There is no legal obligation for economic operators to become an AEO, it is a matter of the operators own choice based on their specific situation. </p><p>According to Article 38 of the UCC, the status of AEO consists of different types of authorisations: AEO for Customs Simplifications (AEOC), AEO for Security and Safety (AEOS) and AEO Customs Simplifications/Security and Safety (a combination of the AEOC and AEOS). The criteria, against which applicants are assessed and must meet, fall within the following general headings:</p><p>- Record of compliance with customs legislation and taxation rules, including no record of serious criminal offences relating to the economic activity of the applicant;</p><p>- Demonstration of a high level of control of its operations and of the flow of the goods, by means of a system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate customs controls;</p><p>- Proven financial solvency.</p><p>And depending of the type of AEO:</p><p>- Practical standards of competence or professional qualifications directly related to the activity carried out (AEOC);</p><p>- Appropriate security and safety standards (AEOS).</p><p>All applicants for AEO are assessed for their suitability, based on the EU agreed criteria, on a case by case basis. Revenue assess if the applicant meets the required criteria and determines whether AEO status should be authorised, or not, and what conditions or arrangements are appropriate for each particular case.  There is no fee for application, nor is there any required size or scale of business.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that 144 economic operators currently hold AEO status in Ireland. The breakdown for each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018 is as follows: 2014, 12; 2015, 8; 2016, 10; 2017, 17 and 2018 (to 9<sup>th</sup>May 2018), 5. I am advised that on average Revenue has received 1 application per month. </p><p>With regards to the number of companies that may require AEO status as a consequence of the UK leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union, as already stated, there is no legal obligation for economic operators to become an AEO, it is a matter of the operators own choice based on their specific situation. Revenue is meeting with representative groups and attending industry seminars to discuss the potential issues resulting from Brexit. Revenue continues to advise businesses to examine the possible impacts of Brexit on their supply chains and to consider applying for one or more of the authorisations or simplifications available that best suit their business model.  </p><p>Advice and assistance on customs authorisations and simplifications is available on the Revenue website Revenue will continue to engage with representative groups, taking account of developments in the ongoing EU-UK negotiations.</p></reply>

The German local public banks, known as Sparkassen, are not permitted to operate beyond specific geographic regions in which they are located. The business model of Sparkassen is not to maximise profits, but rather promote economic development and financial inclusion in the particular region in which they operate. Another important element of this business model is that Sparkassen work closely with local SMEs in their area. </p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process, engaging with stakeholders and interested parties. This consultation process was carried out last year by the Department of Rural and Community Development, assisted by the Department of Finance.   </p>  <p>  As well as the public consultation process, there has also been detailed analysis of a proposal for a potential model of local public banking in Ireland, based on the German Sparkassen model. This proposal was put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group. There has been considerable engagement between officials in both Departments and representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department and the Department of Community and Rural Development have been working closely together and they have now completed the report on the findings of their analysis of the Sparkassen local public banking model in Ireland. Along with my colleague, Minister Ring, I expect to be in a position to bring this joint Report on the local public banking to Government for approval in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Once the Report has been approved by Government, it is anticipated that it will then be published. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that there are already significant Government measures in place to support access to finance by Irish SMEs.  These include the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices, the Credit Review Office and the Credit and Counter Guarantee Schemes.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department is working with other Government departments to develop tailored and innovative schemes to meet the evolving needs of Irish SMEs, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme I announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018 respectively. </p></reply>

The Board of the NTMA oversees those governance structures and both the Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are ex-officio members of the Board. </p>  <p>  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance and a senior official from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also sit on the NTMA Board&rsquo;s State Claims Agency Strategy Sub-Committee. This Sub-Committee, which has been operational since September 2017, assists the SCA in providing advice on strategic, policy and organisational issues.    </p>  <p>  While the SCA is a body under my aegis, of necessity, the handling of cases related to a particular Minister&rsquo;s area of responsibility require close coordination with the Department concerned. On this basis the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2000, under which the SCA was established, provides for the SCA to deal directly with the bodies which are delegated to it for claims management on behalf of the relevant Minister.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-15a.486.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051500074#WRL03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216, 217 and 218 together.</p>  <p>  Table 3 on Page 22 of the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2017 set out an amount of &euro;3.2 billion in respect of the estimated net fiscal space for 2019. In arriving at this net amount, the fiscal space impact of certain pre-committed voted expenditure was deducted from the gross fiscal space.  The nominal amounts relating to these pre-commitments were set out in Table 1.3 on Page 9 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report (MYER) 2017, with &euro;0.4 billion of current expenditure in respect of demographics and &euro;0.3 billion of capital expenditure arising from increases set out in the Public Capital Plan and from prior year budget adjustments.</p>  <p>  The SES and the MYER did not reflect the impact of the abolition of domestic water charges and the consequent change in funding arrangements for Irish Water. Irish Water expenditure was therefore included within the overall General Government expenditure amounts in the SES, and reflected increases in relation to Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment programme.  With funding in respect of domestic water services now being provided through voted expenditure, &euro;0.1 billion of the overall year-on-year increase in voted capital expenditure in 2019 arises from the change in funding arrangements for Irish Water and is therefore technical in nature.  This technical change was reflected in the multi-annual capital ceilings included in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 published in December last year. </p>  <p>  Consequently, of the &euro;2.6 billion in voted expenditure pre-commitments set out in the Stability Programme Update 2018, the fiscal space impact of nominal amounts of &euro;0.4 billion in voted current expenditure and &euro;0.4 billion in voted capital expenditure, including the &euro;0.1 billion in relation to Irish Water capital expenditure, were taken into account in arriving at the estimated net fiscal space amount of &euro;3.2 billion for 2019 in last year&rsquo;s SES.  </p>  <p>  Table 4 on Page 23 of the SES outlines the indicative allocation of available net fiscal space for 2018-2021.  This Table outlines an indicative allocation of &euro;1.5 billion in fiscal space for expenditure in 2019, with over &euro;0.9 billion of this amount for current expenditure and just under &euro;0.6 billion for capital expenditure.  This was the pre-Budget position and expenditure allocations made as part of the Budget Estimates process in October last year, set out in Expenditure Report 2018, utilise most of this indicative allocation.   </p>  <p>  In relation to current expenditure there are pre-commitments that arose after the SES of &euro;0.7 billion that would need to be funded from the current expenditure fiscal space amount or from savings/reprioritisation.  There is a cost of &euro;0.4 billion arising in 2019 from the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA).  This amount was not included as pre-committed expenditure in the SES or the MYER as the agreement at that stage was subject to ratification by the membership of the Public Service Unions and Staff Associations. In addition, as outlined in the Expenditure Report 2018, there was a cost estimated, at that time, of &euro;0.2 billion in respect of the carryover impact of certain Budget 2018 measures that would need to be met from the available resources for 2019 or from savings/reprioritisation.  The current estimate of the carryover impact into 2019 is &euro;0.3 billion. This estimated carryover impact will be reviewed in the context of this year&rsquo;s MYER to take account of expenditure developments during the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 last October, additional capital was allocated over the four year period 2018 to 2021 following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan.  Expenditure Report 2018 set out gross voted capital expenditure amounts of &euro;5.3 billion for 2018 and &euro;6.6 billion for 2019.  These amounts were in line with the increases set out in the MYER, with just over &euro;0.3 billion in the pre-Budget position and just under &euro;1 billion to be allocated as part of the Budget 2018 process.  The fiscal space impact of the additional capital allocated during the Budget 2018 process is in line with the indicative allocations of fiscal space for capital grants and gross fixed capital formation of just under &euro;0.6 billion in aggregate.  Consequently, these increases fully utilise the indicative fiscal space for capital grants and gross fixed capital formation set out in the SES for 2019. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan revised the Departmental capital expenditure ceilings for 2019 to 2021, published in REV 2018, to facilitate the early commencement of a number of funds. The voted capital expenditure amount in the Stability Programme Update for 2019 reflects the additional funding allocated in the National Development Plan in respect of the Rural, Urban, and Innovation Funds.  With the cost of the funds being partly covered by an unallocated capital reserve, the additional cost arising in 2019 is less than &euro;0.1 billion. </p>  <p>  Consequently, the expenditure pre-commitments outlined in the Stability Programme Update that arose after publication of last year&rsquo;s SES and MYER amount to &euro;1.8 billion, with an impact of c. &euro;1.4 billion after taking into account the estimated effect of the capital smoothing adjustment that applies under the Expenditure Benchmark.</p></reply>

The OPW&rsquo;s further assessment of Burnfoot is nearing completion. I expect to be in a position to make a decision and an announcement in relation to Burnfoot in the very near future.</p><p>The recently announced Flood Risk Management Plans proposed a flood relief scheme for Buncrana-Luddan consisting of a series of sea walls, flood embankments and floodwalls to protect against coastal and fluvial flood events.  The flooding which occurred at Elm Park will be considered as part of the development of detailed design of a scheme for Buncranna that will also include further environmental assessment, public consultation and review of costs and benefits.</p><p>Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address.  Donegal County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.  The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works for funding of flood mitigation works under this Office's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme, introduced in 2009, is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The OPW has approved 34 Minor Works schemes in Donegal at a cost of &euro;1.5 million.  Details of these schemes are on the OPW website<i>,</i><i>www.opw.ie.</i></p><p>For properties at risk outside of the areas assessed under the CFRAM study there are a range of measures, in addition to the Minor Works Scheme, that are available to help prevent, protect and mitigate their flood risk, including:</p><p>- Planning guidelines to prevent building in flood-prone areas,</p><p>- Emergency response planning to help prevent and mitigate flood damage during a flood event that will be supported through the development of the National Flood Forecasting Service,</p><p>- Voluntary Home Relocation (once-off) Scheme for those worst affected by the floods in 2015.</p><p>The Office of Public Works is currently researching options for Government to consider for any possible feasible support to Individual Property Protection in the future.</p></reply>

It has come to the OPW's attention in very recent days that the savecorkcity group subsequently commissioned the Delft University in the Netherlands to carry out an assessment of the costs of this alternative proposal as they were set out in the OPW report.  Although the Delft report appears to have been completed on the 10th April it was only last week that certain extracts from the report surfaced in the media which made the OPW aware of its existence.  The savecorkcity group did not inform the OPW of the report or provide the OPW with a copy of the report or its terms of reference.  A copy of the report was requested by the OPW from the savecorkcity group last week and was subsequently provided.</p>  <p>  The OPW has had the savecorkcity/Delft report reviewed and can confirm that, when read in full, the report actually validates the order of magnitude costings contained in the OPW&rsquo;s own tidal barrier report and does not identify any issues which would materially alter the costs estimates in the OPW&rsquo;s report.  The savecorkcity/Delft report comes up with a construction-only cost of &euro;258m compared with the OPW&rsquo;s cost of &euro;289m.  The difference can be attributed to the fact that the savecorkcity/Delft report does not include sufficient allowances for many items including significant embankment elements, any measures to prevent bypass of the barrier, the costs of protection against fluvial flooding and operational and maintenance costs.  If these corrections were made in the savecorkcity/Delft report then the whole life cost of the savecorkcity barrier proposal would be very similar to the estimate of &euro;0.5billion contained in the OPW report, and would therefore not be cost beneficial.</p>  <p>  It must also be noted that, aside from matters of costs,  the location, type and size of the barrier proposed in the savecorkcity proposal is considered likely to be neither technically nor environmentally viable.</p></reply>

Further advance construction elements which involve relocation of services and utilities along the Promenade are expected to commence in 2018.</p>  <p>  A briefing to update members of Wexford County Council will take place in Enniscorthy on May 21, and following this, a public information display of the scheme will take place on 11th June.  Following this, the scheme design and Environmental Impact Assessment Report (and other relevant reports) will be made available to the public through the statutory Exhibition process.  All submissions received during this statutory consultation process will be assessed, and designs may be amended as a result.  Subsequently, formal Confirmation or approval for the scheme will be sought from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with construction expected to start in mid to late 2019.</p></reply>

The Act provides for a<i>Single Public Service Pension Scheme</i>for the generality of new public servants including teachers. The Single Scheme was commenced with effect from 1 January 2013 by Order by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The Single Scheme provides that new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after 1 January 2013 are, in general, members of the Single Scheme. In addition former public service employees returning to the public service after a break of <i>more than 26 weeks</i>in pensionable public sector employment become members of the Single Scheme. (Persons in pre-existing public service pension schemes, returning directly from approved leave of absence do not become members of the Single Scheme.)</p><p>The contribution rates payable by Single Scheme members&rsquo; while in paid pensionable employment consists of 3.5% of net pensionable pay (i.e. pensionable pay less twice the rate of State Pension Contributory) <i>plus</i>3% of pensionable pay. </p><p>Subject to having paid into the Scheme for at least 24 months, the minimum age at which pension will be payable is linked to the State Pension age, that is age 66 years currently, rising to age 67 years in 2021 and age 68 in 2028. A compulsory retirement age of 70 also applies. </p><p>The legislation provides a facility for early retirement from age 55 on cost-neutral grounds. In such cases the benefits payable will be actuarially reduced. </p><p>The single scheme also provides for benefits in the following circumstances:</p><p>- early retirement on medical grounds, subject to certain conditions;</p><p>- death in service benefit of twice annual pensionable remuneration;</p><p>- preserved benefits paid on application at the age at which a member would be eligible to receive the State Pension Contributory (SPC); The preserved benefits would be payable on reaching State Pension Age to a person who left public service employment before normal pension age having completed the vesting period.</p><p>- pensions for spouses or civil partners and eligible children where the Single Scheme member dies in service or following retirement.</p><p>Unlike pre-existing public service pension schemes where benefits are calculated by reference to pensionable pay at retirement, under the Single Scheme career average earnings are used to calculate benefits. A member builds up two types of benefits, called Referable Amounts, while in paid pensionable employment. Separate Referable Amounts are built up towards retirement lump sum and annual retirement pension.</p><p>For most public servants, including teachers, who are members of the Single Scheme the pension Referable Amounts accrue at the rate of 0.58% of pensionable pay up to a threshold of 3.74 times the value of the Contributory State Pension, <i>plus</i>, where pensionable pay exceeds that threshold, at the rate of 1.25% on the excess. (At this time the threshold equates to &euro;47,480.77 per annum.)</p><p>The Lump sum Referable Amount accrues at a rate of 3.75% of pensionable pay.</p><p>Where a person is not working on a full-time basis the referable amounts are adjusted by reference to the proportion that the number of hours worked bear to the full-time hours. </p><p>For amounts earned during earlier years of membership of the Scheme, the legislation provides that these may be increased in subsequent years having regard to changes in the consumer price index. </p><p>The maximum gross annual pension that may accrues at retirement will be equivalent to the sum of the referable amounts together with adjustments in the period as provided for having regard to changes in the Consumer Price Index. Similarly the gross lump sum payable will be the equivalent of the sum of the lump sum referable amounts in respect of the period as adjusted by changes to CPI.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has overall responsibility for public service pension policy, has available on its website extensive information on the Public Service Single Scheme to assist Single Scheme members and other interested parties. The information may be accessed at the following link: </p></reply>

This includes providing for religious instruction according to the profile of the students who attend the school.</p><p>In relation to religious instruction my Department recently published Circular letter 0013/2018 &ldquo;<i>Religious instruction and worship in certain second level schools in the context of Article 44.2.4 of the Constitution of Ireland and section 30 of the Education Act, 1998</i>&rdquo; which sets out a new approach to the arrangements that are made for religious instruction and worship in Education and Training Board (ETB) and Community post primary schools. </p><p>The new arrangements will require State multi-denominational post primary schools to consult with parents and, in the case of pupils who have reached the age of 18, the pupil, to ascertain their wishes in relation to religious instruction. Schools will be required to incorporate parental choice regarding religious instruction as part of the normal processes for planning and timetabling subject choices generally. Decisions in relation to alternative subject(s) offered for those who do not want religious instruction is a matter for each school concerned.</p><p>The key change is that those pupils who do not want instruction in line with the requirements of any particular religion should be timetabled for alternative tuition throughout the school year rather that supervised study or other activities.  These changes will ensure that children who do not want to participate in religious instruction will have a meaningful alternative.</p><p>While Circular 13/2018 has immediate effect my Department acknowledges that it will take time for schools to reflect the new arrangements in their work of revising new timetables for the 2018/19 school year. Regard will also have to be made for existing curricular choices and arrangements in place for junior and senior years.</p><p>I believe that a school&rsquo;s arrangements for those students who do not wish to attend religious instruction should be made clear to parents at the outset.  In that regard, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new school admission legislation taking into account current draft proposals.</p><p>I am bringing forward in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard. The Bill passed Committee Stage on 28 June 2017 and will shortly proceed to Report Stage.</p></reply>

These supports include additional teaching and care support, enhanced capitation, specialist school transport arrangements, assistive technology and/or specialist equipment, adaptations for school buildings where necessary and additional training for teachers of children with special educational needs. </p><p>The functions of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) include planning and coordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required.  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s SENO responsibility includes planning and coordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, including supporting children and parents in identifying school placement options and resource needs. Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs.</p><p>From 21st March 2017, the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behavioural Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for Children who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing and Children who are Blind/Visually Impaired (VTHVI) transferred from my Department to the NCSE and joined with the services already being provided by NCSE&rsquo;s SENOs and administrative staff to form a new NCSE Support Service. This new service aims to develop schools&rsquo; capacity to include students with special educational needs and to promote a continuum of educational provision which is inclusive and responsive.</p><p>Children with Dyspraxia may be entitled to additional teaching provision in school, under the new model for allocating special education teachers, which was introduced since September 2017. Under this model, schools are provided with an allocation for special educational support teaching to support all students who need such support.</p><p>Schools now have greater discretion as to how they can deploy resources, to take account of the actual learning needs students have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability.</p><p>My Department recently published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model. These guidelines are available at </p><p>The guidelines will support schools in how they identify students, including students with Dyspraxia/DCD for additional teaching support, and decide how much support to provide, taking into account the extent and severity of their needs.</p><p>Where students have additional care needs, which are so significant that they require additional adult support in order to attend school and access the curriculum, they may be supported by Special Needs Assistants. </p><p>SNA support is provided specifically to assist recognised primary, post primary and special schools to cater for the care needs of students with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a student will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Departments Circular 30/2014.</p><p>In circumstances where students with Dyspraxia/Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have care needs to the extent that the school considers SNA support is required for them to attend and access the curriculum, the school may apply to the NCSE for SNA support.</p><p>Funding is also provided to schools towards the cost of assistive technology, for children with special educational needs which is essential for educational purposes, to assist children with special educational needs in Primary, Post Primary and Special schools, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0010/2013. </p><p>The NCSE provides for support for additional training needs in the area of Dyspraxia for teachers  through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs. The SESS provides Continuing Professional Development (CPD) support for teachers of pupils with Dyspraxia through an Inclusive Learning Resource Teachers course as well as an online resource facility and an online book borrowing facility.</p><p>All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are available on the Department's website. Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>Post primary school students with special needs may have special arrangements made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate. Candidates with disabilities can apply through their school for reasonable accommodation during examinations.<b></b>Further details of supports are available from the State Examinations Commission (SEC) Reasonable Accommodations Section.</p><p>At third level, the National Office for Equity of Access to Third Level Education, within the Higher Education Authority (HEA), administers a number of access measures including the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD), the purpose of which is to assist students with disabilities.  A range of supports are available at third level colleges to support students who have disabilities or special educational needs. Details of the additional support and services that are available for students with medical conditions/disabilities at third level colleges will be provided by the Disability Officers at each college.</p><p>The supports which will be provided for students with special educational needs, including Dyspraxia/Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), will take account of the needs that each pupil has and the type of college or course that they are attending.</p><p>Students with disabilities or severe medical conditions should contact the Disability Office before the beginning of the academic year to find out what disability supports will be available to them and will need to discuss with the Disability/Access Officer in the college/university details of their needs based requirement in college.</p></reply>

This is the reason why I established the Working Group in March 2017 to develop a plan that would safeguard the future of the Castlebar campus. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group was published in December 2017. It provides a wide-ranging assessment of the context within which the Campus is currently operating, and outlines a proposed vision for the future of the Mayo Campus. It also provides a strategic and comprehensive plan to address the financial and sustainability issues which have been experienced by the GMIT Mayo Campus in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Working Group recommendations are primarily for GMIT to implement. However, there are recommendations that relate specifically to my Department for action.  In response to this my Department has prioritised these recommendations including the provision of ring fenced funding for the Castlebar campus for each of the next five years while the plan is being implemented.  I wish to advise that the provision of this additional funding is contingent on GMIT progressing the implementation of the recommendations of the report, and is subject to review by the HEA. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are working with GMIT to ensure that the other recommendations are being progressed. These include the appointment of an external facilitator and the appointment of a head of campus for the Mayo campus.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the recruitment campaign for the head of campus will be initiated by GMIT shortly. A previous recruitment process had to be cancelled by GMIT. </p>  <p>  The appointment of an independent external facilitator who will oversee the transition to the new structural and operational arrangements is a significant recommendation. The facilitator will play an important role in supporting the implementation of a number of the other Working Group recommendations.  The procurement of this expertise will be initiated shortly by GMIT. </p>  <p>  GMIT has established a sub committee to ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  This committee and GMIT issue regular updates on progress to the HEA who will continue to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the recommendations GMIT are currently considering the position and options relating to potential staff redeployment as part of a suite of measures.  However it is envisaged that any measures will be on a voluntary basis. Any proposals in this area will also be subject to approval by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-15a.609.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051500077#WRO01000"><p>When schools in Ireland are implementing the new Framework for Junior Cycle, they have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.  I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.</p><p>Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward. </p><p>Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools. Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle. </p><p>  Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past. History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.</p><p>I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA. This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.</p><p>The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students. The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart. Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.</p><p>In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them. </p><p>The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years. For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly. Those very skills, and attitudes, can indeed be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of history, news and current affairs too.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support. </p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>The deadline for applying for SNA support for the 2018/19 school year was extended from 28 February to 7 March 2018 due to the effects of adverse weather. The NCSE continue to receive applications after this date and they are processed according to date of receipt. the NCSE aim to respond to valid applications received later this month.</p><p>The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that Department policy was not met in accordance with Circular 0030/2014. </p><p>Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA supports to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned.</p><p>I have arranged for the NCSE to respond directly to the Deputy, as this relates to an individual school and the NCSE's complaint procedures, which is available at .</p></reply>

The scheme is currently intended to cover up to 60% of the costs of establishing these systems. Applicants for grant aid under the scheme are not precluded from applying for funding from any other sources which may assist in making up the balance of funding required.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Ballymun Garda Station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 March 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the DMR North Division was 665, of whom 109 were assigned to Ballymun Garda Station including 12 sergeants.  There are also 43 Garda Reserves and 39 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  More than 120 extra Garda were assigned to the specialist units within Special Crime Operations since 2017.  In addition, a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the DMR was established at the end of 2016 in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that a number of measures have been put in place to address the difficulties experienced in Ballymun.  These measures include additional high-visibility patrols, support from the regional public order unit and operations by the local drug unit and will continue into the future.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  140 members of this cohort have been assigned to the DMR North Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR North Division.</p>  <p>  Appointments to the ranks of sergeant are a matter for the Commissioner under section 14 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that the overall strength of the sergeant rank was 1,861 as of 31 March 2018, the latest date for which figures are available.  I am further advised by the Commissioner that there is currently a competition in train for promotion to the rank of sergeant with the aim of bringing the strength to 2,000, as agreed under the Employment Control Framework.  I am assured by the Commissioner that following completion of these competitions the needs of all Garda Divisions including the DMR North Division will be fully considered when determining the allocation of Sergeants.</p></reply>

Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.  There are currently four options for investing, one of which is the endowment of &euro;500,000 (or &euro;400,000 where a group of 5 or more combine to make a large endowment) towards a project of public benefit in the arts, sports, health, cultural or educational field.</p><p>Any endowment proposed should be regarded as a philanthropic contribution with a clear public benefit and investors will receive no financial return or recoupment of the principal.

Any successful endowment project must provide a benefit to the public that is enduring and not one that is no longer sustainable once the endowment funding ceases.</p><p>The independent evaluation committee is not available to meet individual project proposers or applicants.  However, officials of my Department who administer the programme and provide secretariat to the committee have met with project proposers to explain applicable criteria.

However, it found that in a system where there is no limit on the timeframe within which an application for international protection is determined, the applicants&rsquo; constitutional rights would be breached.  The Government responded to the Supreme Court decision by agreeing to opt in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive.  This will allow effective labour market access for applicants who have not received a first instance decision within nine months of their application.  Opting into the Directive is a very positive development for the entire protection system and for applicants and their families while they await a final decision on their application. In addition to labour market access, the Directive also includes important provisions in relation to children&rsquo;s rights, health, education and material reception conditions for applicants, which includes housing, food, clothing and a daily expenses allowance. </p>  <p>  During the opt-in process with the EU which we expect to have completed in June, interim arrangements have been put in place.  When the Supreme Court struck down the law prohibiting labour market access, international protection applicants, as a category of non-EEA nationals, came under the terms of the Employment Permits Act 2003 (as amended).  Under that Act, third country nationals can apply for an employment permit in certain sectors defined by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Employment permit fees apply, set by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (these are generally paid by wholly or partly by employers).  I also introduced a complementary self-employment scheme for eligible applicants (those in the system for over nine months without a first instance decision) &ndash; Ireland being one of very few European countries allowing such access.  The total number of Self Employment applications received to date is 584, of which 399 have been granted.</p>  <p>  I would stress that this interim scheme is designed to be of very short duration until the opt-in process into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive is completed.  The process of compliance is on course to be completed within the expected timeframe.  Once this happens, access to the labour market will be underpinned by EU law and I will have the opportunity to propose to Government a new scheme allowing effective access to the labour market.  I expect that this permanent scheme will provide for a broader access to the labour market for qualified applicants &ndash; the details of which are well advanced and will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I am confident that this progressive approach by Government, which for the first time will see additional elements of our protection process subject to EU law and verification by the EU Commission, will be a further major effective and reforming step as we seek to improve the standards of our reception conditions and efficient determination of protection applications.</p></reply>

The ceremonies, which have been met with universal approval, are held at no extra cost to applicants, allow large numbers of candidates for citizenship make their statutory declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the law, the oath of fidelity must be sworn before a judge.  Prior to the introduction of the ceremonies, each individual applicant was required to attend their local District Court to swear the oath and this was done as part of the normal business of the court on the day that usually included a range of other business both criminal and civil.  Apart from taking up valuable court time, it was considered that a dedicated ceremony would provide a much more meaningful and dignified manner for swearing the oath, befitting the importance and solemnity of the occasion.  Accordingly, there are no plans to revert to this practice or to introduce alternatives to the ceremonies. </p>  <p>  Citizenship ceremony days take place periodically throughout the year.  The organisation of a ceremony day which can involve over 3,500 applicants, together with their family and friends, is a significant logistical exercise usually taking a number of months to organise.  To date, 131 such ceremonies have been held at which around 83,000 candidates have become Irish citizens.  On 21 May next a further 3,500 persons will be conferred with Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  Extensive coordination is required to establish a date for ceremonies. Not only does a venue have to be sourced and dates agreed, the Presiding Officers and Ministerial speakers need to be available on the day.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department also liaises closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with regard to ceremony day dates as there is an inevitable rise in demand for passports following ceremonies.  This is a complex logistical exercise and to attempt to dovetail dates with the closing date of the supplementary register would make the entire process unworkable.</p>  <p>  The date for the next ceremony which is scheduled for 21 May was announced on the website www.inis.gov.ie on 5 March 2018, which was prior to the announcement of the date of the upcoming referendum.</p></reply>

This was a particularly tragic case and one that still resonates with the Irish people after all this time.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that an inquest was held into the death of the person in question on 21 February 1984.  The Coroner, in the independent performance of his duties, directed the jury to deliver a verdict of death consistent with the pathologist&rsquo;s findings which, I understand, related to complications arising from childbirth. </p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the Coroner's Act 1962 provides that a coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions, in relation to which he or she is independent.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has no role in the scheduling or conduct of an inquest, which is a matter for the relevant Coroner.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that an investigation into this matter took place and a file was prepared and forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), which issued a direction that there was to be no prosecution in the matter.  As the Deputies will appreciate, the question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted, and for what criminal offence, is the sole responsibility of the DPP, who is independent in the performance of her functions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Garda investigation file on this case, I have been advised that the file in question is located at Granard Garda Station.  I have asked my officials to check what papers are held on the matter in my own Department and I will communicate further with the Deputy in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that any decision to conduct further investigations into this matter is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in an operational matter such as this.  The question of the holding of a Commission of Investigation into the matter is not one that I am aware of having arisen and I have no plans in this regard.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 31 March 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Sligo/Leitrim Division was 303.  There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.  </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  18 members of this cohort have been assigned to the Sligo/Leitrim Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.  </p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.  </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Sligo/Leitrim Division.  </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  </p><p>The number of newly attested Garda&iacute; allocated to the Sligo/Leitrim Division in 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018 is as set out in the following table:  </p><p><b>New recruits assigned to Sligo/Leitrim 2015 -2018</b><table><tr><th>Sligo/Leitrim </th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>18</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Act provides that if either of a child's parents was, at the time of that child's birth, an Irish citizen, that child is an Irish citizen irrespective of the place of birth.  In this particular case as neither parent was an Irish citizen at the time of the child's birth, the child does not have any automatic entitlement to be an Irish citizen under the Act.  </p><p>Section 6A of the Act also provides that a child born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 has an entitlement to Irish citizenship if, at the time of the birth of the child, one of his or her parents had, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.  Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded under the Act from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.  Time spent in Subsidiary Protection is not reckonable for naturalisation purposes.  </p><p>Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have 5 years residence in the State.  Detailed information on citizenship and the naturalisation process, including the relevant application forms, is available on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.  </p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

This Division also deals with security matters.  </p>  <p>  Aside from this specific area of my Department, the Deputy will appreciate that North-South co-operation in justice matters has been enhanced considerably since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and a large number of staff across the range of responsibilities of my Department and the related justice agencies are involved in ongoing, practical North-South initiatives with their counterparts in Northern Ireland as an integral part of their ongoing responsibilities.  </p>  <p>  For example, the Intergovernmental Agreement on Cooperation on Criminal Justice Matters provides a structured framework for this co-operation with dedicated work streams including youth justice, probation, forensic science, registered offenders and social diversity.  The annual Cross-Border Conference on Organised Crime is a long running initiative organised by my Department, the Northern Ireland Justice Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI. It provides an ongoing mechanism to exchange and develop best practice and to support operational co-operation in combatting organised crime on a cross-border basis.  The Director General of INIS jointly chairs the Common Travel Area Forum with his UK counterpart.  It meets regularly to support and enhance co-operation in the management of the Common Travel Area and it naturally maintains a particular focus on the North-South dimension.  </p></reply>

While each court of first instance (High, Circuit and District) has used the poor box system on occasion, it is mainly used in the District Court where the judge may order the defendant to pay a donation into the court poor box in lieu of another penalty and usually arises where the offence is minor in nature and would not attract a custodial sentence.  </p>  <p>  There are many reasons and instances why the court poor box is used by judges.  For example, the accused may never previously have been before the courts; the accused may have pleaded guilty to a minor offence; a conviction might be inappropriate or might adversely affect employment, career or working abroad prospects; and/or the offence may be of a minor or trivial nature.  </p>  <p>  When combined with the Probation of Offenders Act it provides an option where some financial penalty is considered merited but a conviction and fine are not.  It can sometimes be a more meaningful punishment than the maximum fine.  </p>  <p>  Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  </p>  <p>  The Government has approved the drafting of a Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is intended that the legislation will abolish the court poor box and replace it with a statutory Reparation Fund to provide for a fair, equitable and transparent system of reparation that will apply only to minor offences dealt with by the District Court.  </p></reply>

Overall, export growth in Ireland in recent years has been exceptionally strong and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  According to CSO merchandise trade and balance of payments data, total exports have increased by 58 percent since 2012 to &euro;283.7billion in 2017.  The outlook for global economic growth is positive in the short term. According to the OECD March Interim Economic Outlook, the world economy will continue to strengthen over the next two years, with global GDP growth projected to reach almost 4 percent in both 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>  The Government is intensifying its efforts, domestically and internationally, to support companies with a view to mitigating potential negative impacts of Brexit. Government&rsquo;s national enterprise policy 'Enterprise 2025 Renewed', published in March 2018, was developed specifically through the lens of Brexit, recent international tax developments, the pace of technological advances and changes being introduced under the current US administration. Enterprise 2025 prioritises embedding resilience in the enterprise base, enhancing productivity, delivering quality jobs, promoting collaboration between Irish and foreign owned companies and harnessing the potential of innovation and talent across all regions.</p>  <p>  In the 'Building Stronger Business' report, my Department set out a strategy to minimise risks of Brexit and maximise opportunities across four pillars of helping companies to compete, innovate, trade and to negotiate the best outcome for business.  It sets out the range of diagnostic, advisory and financial supports that are being made available to companies to help minimise Brexit impacts and target new opportunities.  Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for businesses and a &euro;25 million Brexit response loan scheme for the agrifood sector.  This is in addition to supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50 million in total.  The fund of &euro;116 billion announced in Project 2040 for capital investment over the next decade will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects which can accelerate economic growth and mitigate the impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  We aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion, achieve 80% of indigenous export growth outside of the UK market and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and published by Enterprise Ireland.  Several events have already taken place, including ministerial-led missions to the USA in January, and Mexico and Russia in February.  Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world are organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests.  The Government has signalled its ambition to further enhance its overseas networks through the Global Footprint 2025 initiative, which aims to double the impact of our overseas presence through an increase in our enterprise agency global footprint and Embassy network.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements opening new markets Irish Firm&rsquo;s goods and services and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.</p>  <p>  On the 21st April 2018, the EU and Mexico reached an agreement in principle on a new trade agreement that will be part of the broader Global Agreement.  The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico where the current value is just over &euro;2 billion per year with total imports of nearly half a billion euros per year.  It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and poultry products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.  There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.  The Agreement will also open up public procurement markets to Irish businesses and remove technical barriers to trade which will reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market.</p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.  The agri-food sector, in particular will see benefits from access to Japan&rsquo;s highly valuable export market, with improved access for beef, pork, cheese and processed agricultural products.  In addition the EU&rsquo;s trade deal with Singapore is hoped to come into force by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  During his September 2017 State of the Union address, the President of the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed opening trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  The draft negotiating mandates for Australia and New Zealand are currently being discussed by the Commission and Member States and I expect them to receive Ministerial signoff at the Trade Council of Ministers later this month.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  My Department has recently commissioned a study to examine the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from FTAs, both currently in place and in negotiation. The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.</p></reply>

These include increasing our indigenous exports to reach &euro;26 billion by 2020 - up by 26% from 2015, generating 30,000 more jobs in tourism by 2020 and &euro;5 billion in overseas tourism revenues by 2025, and securing 900 new foreign direct investments in the period 2015-2019.  Specifically, in relation to Brexit, the target is to intensify and diversify 80% of indigenous export growth to 2020 to be outside of the UK market and maintain exports of at least &euro;7.5 billion to the UK.</p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets.  In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  More recently, Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020.  The strategy also targets a 50 percent increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020.</p></reply>

Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank with Allied Irish Bank following in June.</p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme.  This initial application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. The SBCI assesses these applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number.  Approval of loans are subject to the finance providers own credit policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  The Scheme was launched on 28 March, and it is too early yet for businesses to have completed both application processes. Metrics detailing the uptake of the scheme will be available at the end of Quarter 2, 2018.</p></reply>

An important way for the Agency to deliver on this goal is to help potential overseas investors in the regions find suitable commercial property.  With that aim in mind, the IDA launched its Regional Property Programme (RPP) in 2015 to ensure a better supply of commercial properties suitable for investment outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  As well as upgrading existing buildings and acquiring strategic sites suitable for foreign direct investment (FDI), the RPP includes the construction of nine advance facilities around the country.  Two such facilities were constructed and completed in Athlone and Waterford in 2014 and early 2015.  Further buildings were completed last year, including in Castlebar.  The facility in the town is now being actively marketed to potential investors by the Agency.  Whilst there have been two site visits to County Mayo as of the first quarter of 2018, data on IDA Ireland site visits is collated on a county-by-county basis only. Information on the number of site visits to specific locations in individual counties is therefore unavailable.</p>  <p>  It is the case that the overall FDI trends in Mayo are positive, with 16 IDA supported companies employing 4,462 people in the County.  In the last two years, two notable successes have been the Coca-Cola Company announcing an investment of &euro;26 million in its Ballina operations and Fort Wayne Metals Ireland announcing a &euro;10 million expansion of its production operations in Castlebar.  The County experienced a 26% increase in FDI related employment from 2012 to 2017 and the IDA is working hard to create further employment opportunities there.</p></reply>

One of the new supports that Enterprise Ireland has introduced to encourage companies to enter new markets is the Market Discovery Fund.</p><p>Launched in January 2018, the Market Discovery Fund aims to encourage companies to expand into new markets by helping with the costs of researching viable and sustainable market entry strategies.</p><p>The Fund provides support towards both internal and external costs incurred by companies when researching new markets for products and services.  Eligible companies can receive support when they are looking at a new geographic market for an existing product/service, or when looking at exporting a new product/service to a market that they already do business in.</p><p>The Market Discovery Fund is available across three levels:</p><p>- Level 1: Grant up to &euro;35K</p><p>- Level 2: Grant greater than &euro;35K but less than &euro;75K</p><p>- Level 3: Grant greater than &euro;75K but less than &euro;150K</p><p>The maximum funding is 50% of eligible expenditure up to a maximum grant of &euro;150,000.  Eligible expenditure includes, but is not limited to, salary support, consultancy costs, trade fair costs and foreign travel. </p><p>The Market Discovery Fund has been open for applications for a number of weeks.  To date, nine Market Discovery Grants have been approved.  Applications can be at various stages of informal discussion before they are formally received and approved, so it is not possible to give a meaningful number in this regard</p><p>Enterprise Ireland only report on funding that has been drawn down, and as the Fund is newly launched no companies have reached this stage to date.</p></reply>

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I recently brought a proposal to Government for a Transport Support Payment Scheme. Following consideration of the proposal by Government, it was agreed that we withdraw the Memorandum and to revert back with a revised proposal to reflect the discussion in due course.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three year period, was &euro;5,020. Following the closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

Prior to that the HSE purchased general indemnity insurance cover from private insurance firms. </p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency has advised my officials that it settles very few claims subject to a confidentiality agreement with the exception of claims settled through mediation.  Part of the process of mediation is that the parties are bound by a strict confidentiality provision contained in the mediation agreement.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme borreliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011, S.I. no 452 of 2011.</p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful consideration of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which have implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.</p><p>Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme disease is provided routinely by hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the UK's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) Service of Public Health England Porton which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  All laboratories must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  All testing in Ireland is confirmed by RIPL.</p><p>It is important that people with symptoms seek appropriate medical attention, either from their family doctor or access specialist services.  Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, then management of patients can be undertaken by Infectious Disease consultants in regional hospitals when intravenous antibiotics may be considered as a method of treatment.  There is no evidence that viable <i>Borrelia burgdorferi </i>persists in patients with prolonged, subjective symptoms following confirmed Lyme disease.</p><p>A Lyme Disease Subcommittee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre with professional clinical, entomological, scientific and environmental health expert representation (including a representative of the Lyme Support Group, Tick-Talk Ireland) has been established to explore all possible ways of raising awareness about Lyme disease.  This Subcommittees report will cover a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to clinical management of the condition.</p><p>The HPSC provides advice and information concerning developments regarding the testing and treatment of Lyme disease to my Department.</p></reply>

The Capacity Review report makes this clear.</p><p>The National Strategic Framework for Health and Social Care Workforce Planning, which was launched in November 2017, will support an approach to workforce planning that will enable the recruitment and retention of the right mix of health workers, across the health system. </p><p>Effective workforce planning and appropriate resourcing of health services will also be a key enabler of Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  This will be addressed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan which is expected to be brought to Government shortly.</p><p>These initiatives, in tandem with the findings of the Capacity Review, will provide a robust framework within which workforce planning and assessment can be undertaken on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NTPF have responsibility for the development of this report, although Department Officials continue to engage with the NTPF regarding the review.  The most recent update from the NTPF is that the report will be finalised and ready for review in the first half of 2018.</p><p>In relation to variations in the cost of care for public and private nursing homes it is acknowledged that public nursing homes have, in general, a higher cost of care.  It is understood that a number of factors contribute to this such as higher dependency levels of clients requiring a higher staff skill mix, environmental implications for staffing levels and the geographical provision of residential placements.</p><p>That said, there is a need to undertake a deeper analysis of the factors driving the higher costs of care in public units.  This is why the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme identified the need for a Value for Money and Policy (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private/voluntary residential facilities.  My Department will be working on this VFM throughout the year.</p></reply>

Legislation will be necessary to effect these changes and the General Scheme of a Bill was also approved by Government at that time. Minister Donohoe has indicated that he would ask the Attorney General to prioritise the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age would become effective as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Government also agreed, in advance of the legislation coming into effect, that interim arrangements could be introduced, for serving public servants who reach the age of 65 years between the date of the Government Decision and the coming into effect of the necessary legislation.  These arrangements enable such public servants to be retained until they reach the age of eligibility for Contributory State Pension, which is currently age 66 years.

HPV is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.

Under the legislation having a particular illness does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore the medical conditions of applicants are not monitored on that basis. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for a medical card.  The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This remains the current situation and there are no plans to amend the current income thresholds for medical cards.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this fact, I do recognise the importance of having a medical card application system that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs.  In this regard every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  This includes taking full account of all the circumstances of an applicant including medical evidence of the cost of their illness and other related expenses.</p>  <p>  With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations, i.e. in circumstances where persons with serious medical conditions are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill.  These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a number of weeks.   </p>  <p>  I would also like to note that since 1 July 2015, the HSE adopted the position that all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.  This card is valid for a period of 5 years.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP.  Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at www.hse.ie/yourmedicines. </p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE and you will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 17 schemes.  I have made very considerable funds available to the seafood sector in 2018 through a range of EMFF schemes.  In doing so, I secured a very significant commitment from the Exchequer to the EMFF Programme.  However, this means that there are no other sources of funds available to me, other than the EMFF, to assist the sector with any support requirements.</p>  <p>  The EMFF Regulation (508/2014) restricts supports to aquaculture operators to cover economic losses due to severe storms to a contribution to aquaculture stock insurance under article 57.  Under this article insurance supports can be made available to aquaculture producers to safeguard their income and cover economic losses due to natural disasters and climatic events.  During the course of preparation of Ireland's EMFF Programme in 2014/15, a lengthy public and stakeholder consultation process was undertaken.  The stock insurance provision was not included among the priorities selected for funding under the Programme.  The priorities identified and included in the programme were capital investment in aquaculture sites and innovation, research and advice to develop technology, improve disease management and enhance animal husbandry.</p></reply>

I expect that this Group will finalise an action plan in the coming weeks which will address the short and medium term labour issues facing the dairy sector.  This action plan will make an important contribution to alleviating the labour shortage issue that exists and will be submitted to the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee for information.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work of this group, a range of other measures are being pursued by the dairy sector to try to attract and retain labour, including exchanges with New Zealand, enhanced efforts to recruit from within the European economic area, as well as efforts at regional level to engage with, and attract people on the live register, homemakers and drystock farmers to avail of opportunities on dairy farms.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that a shortage of labour has been building up in certain sub-sectors of the Irish agri-food sector in recent times.  In addition to the dairy sector, labour pressures also exist in the horticultural and meat processing sectors.  While the reasons for the shortages are varied, they include the significant value added growth expansion of the sector in recent years; the growth in the economy as a whole which has meant we are now approaching full employment; and also economic and associated employment growth in other EU countries which have traditionally supplied workers for the Irish agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the impact that these labour shortages are having, and I am committed to continue helping the sectors involved find appropriate solutions.  In this context, I underlined the importance of a new pilot quota of employment permits for the horticulture, meat processing and dairy sectors, announced this week by my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is a measured response to issues raised by the sector as the labour market tightens.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, I met with the CEOs of the main banks and discussed the current cash flow and liquidity position of the primary sector.  I emphasised to them that they should recognise the temporary and exceptional nature of the current situation and that they should be flexible and put in place measures to support their customers.  They indicated to me that there are no signs that there is a liquidity issue across the sector as a whole, while acknowledging that there may be pressures in individual cases.  They assured me that they will provide supports such as extended overdraft facilities and term loans to their customers and asked that those in difficulty should contact them as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities is to improve access to finance for the agri-food sector.  Food Wise 2025 identifies competiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &ldquo;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agri-food companies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Last year I introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, developed in cooperation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). It provided low-cost, flexible working capital finance to farmers to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate following the Brexit vote and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors in 2016/17.  I was pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which was fully subscribed.  The provisional drawdown totals are that there were 4,246 applications totalling &euro;144,903,656, with an average loan size of &euro;34,127 and an average loan period of 41 months.</p>  <p>I launched a new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; on the 28th March in cooperation with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance, which will provide up to &euro;300 million of affordable, flexible working capital finance to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future.  The Scheme will be available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses.  Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.</p>  <p>  I announced in Budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses.  These schemes are developed and delivered in cooperation with the SBCI and take time to develop and operationalise. Consideration and discussions are ongoing in this regard and I will announce further details as they become available.</p></reply>

Over 95% of the remaining reserves are controlled by five countries, including Morocco, China, USA, South Africa and Jordan.  Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient in crop growth and hence can limit global crop yields.  It is included in a list of critical raw materials published by the European Commission in 2017.  Critical raw materials are those raw materials which are economically and strategically important for the European economy, but have a high-risk associated with their supply.</p>  <p>  Ireland imports all of its inorganic (chemical) phosphorous requirements.  The main suppliers of phosphate fertilisers to Ireland are Morocco, Tunisia, and Russia.  Morocco is one of the world&rsquo;s main suppliers and holds the most important phosphate rock reserves in the world.  The only commercially viable source of phosphate rock in the EU is located in Finland.</p>  <p>  The quantity of inorganic phosphorous used by Irish farmers has decreased from a high of 50,000 tonnes in 1989 to a total of 41,893 tonnes in 2016/17.  This reduction was as a result of improved nutrient management at farm level, more efficient use of organic manures (slurry) and a response to increased fertiliser prices.  </p>  <p>  The EU Nitrates Directive, introduced in 2006 set limits for Phosphorous use on farms.  A new Nitrates Action Programme was agreed for Ireland for 2018 -2021 (S.I. No. 605/2017).  This encourages the efficient use of Phosphorous fertiliser and maximises the Phosphorous contribution from animal manures. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the re-use of natural raw materials, which currently go to waste, is one of the cornerstones of the Circular Economy Package, adopted in December 2015 by the EU Commission.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has supported the proposal for an EU Regulation on Fertilisers replacing Regulation No 2003/2003 whereby recycling of waste materials e.g. digestates, composts, food industry by-products and animal by-products can be transformed into organic fertilisers.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission Regulatory Impact Assessment on the proposed Fertiliser Regulation reported that the use of recycled nutrients in the EU could replace up to 30% of the imported Phosphorous requirements.</p></reply>

This work is undertaken in the context of advancing our priorities in relation to the agreed areas of co-operation under the North South Ministerial Council:</p><p>- the development of an All-Island Animal Health Strategy for control of animal movements and the prevention, containment and eradication of epizootic diseases in Ireland;</p><p>- the development of an All-Island Plant Health and Research Strategy including co-operation between both jurisdictions in relation to plant protection products; and</p><p>- liaison on a range of international issues including trade and the Common Agriculture Policy.</p><p>Officials also co-operate in other areas of common interest as specific matters arise, including Brexit, farm safety, EU funding and joint research projects, cross-border laboratory collaboration and the outbreak of the Chalara Fraxinea disease commonly known as ash dieback.</p><p>As engagement in North-South issues are managed as part of the general responsibilities of the many Divisions concerned, it is not possible to identify the specific share of staff time assigned solely or primarily to work on such issues.</p></reply>

Committee members will be reviewing the draft and inputting feedback over the coming weeks.  Subsequently, the draft Threat Response Plan must also undergo public consultation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that as regards the issuing of afforestation licences, under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, any Minister considering a plan or project in a Special Protection Area (SPA) shall give consent for such a plan or project only after having determined that the plan or project shall not adversely affect the integrity of a European site.  A series of judgements issued by the Court of Justice of the EU have stressed that there must be no doubt about possible adverse impacts in such decisions.  In addition, under the European Union guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas, within Natura sites (i.e. SPAs and Special Areas of Conservation, or SACs), only afforestation consistent with the management objectives of the sites concerned, and agreed with the Member State&rsquo;s authority in charge of implementing Natura 2000 (in Ireland&rsquo;s case, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht), shall be allowed.</p></reply>

The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure.</p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or a weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced.  Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group has considered seven months of data to date.  While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability.  The Price Monitoring Group has reported that there are currently 9 different types of price models on the market.  The main price examples include a service charge plus charge per bin lift, with an excess per kg charge, and a service charge plus per kg weight charge.  The most popular service offering now is the &lsquo;service charge including weight allowance, plus per kg charge for excess above allowance&rsquo;. </p><p>An annual support of &euro;75 per person is being made available for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence.  This will help people meet the average annual cost for the disposal of medical incontinence products.  My Department is currently in discussion with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive to finalise the administrative details and arrangements of the support, as well as engaging with the relevant patient stakeholders.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to finalising the details for this support as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Ireland is liaising closely with the Commission on such matters and strongly favours an EU level solution to these issues. </p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that its approach to preparing for Brexit is aimed at minimising the impact of Brexit on our trade and economy and an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  This is certainly the case in aviation, given the importance of the sector for Ireland and the fact that the UK is by far the most important origin and destination for aviation traffic in and out of Ireland. </p></reply>

Furthermore, another major objective is to make substantial progress in linking our regions and urban areas not just to Dublin but to each other.  The NDP also recognises that over the period of the Plan it will be very important to examine the role inter-urban rail network can play in enhancing regional connectivity.</p>  <p>  As part of the Estimates process, the multi-annual capital allocations will be reviewed and extended annually on a rolling basis to cover the coming 5 year period.  This will provide Government with an annual opportunity to review the allocations in light of any implementation issues arising and/or new priorities which may emerge during implementation of the NDP.  The NDP also commits to a full mid-term review of the Plan in 2022 to allow Government take stock of progress and allow it to review and reaffirm its investment priorities.</p></reply>

The DART Expansion Programme will also provide for the delivery of other priority elements including a move to a 10 minute peak-time service and the introduction of additional train fleet including the expansion of the fleet with new diesel electric trains.  The electrification of the Northern Line as far as Balbriggan, incorporating Donabate as well as Rush &amp;amp; Lusk and Skerries, is expected to be delivered in 2022.</p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility for implementation of public transport in the Greater Dublin Area, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply.

Phase 1 involved the reopening of the 36 mile stretch of railway line between Ennis and Athenry and this is part of the TEN-T comprehensive network.  This line was opened to the public in March 2010.  Exchequer funding of &euro;106.5 million was approved for Phase 1.</p>  <p>  The plan for Phase 2 involved the development of the line from Athenry to Tuam.  However, this development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.  Phase 3 involved the development of the line from Tuam to Claremorris.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, both the 'Programme for a Partnership Government' and the recently-published 'National Development Plan' commit to an independent review of the costings for a proposal to extend the existing Western Rail Corridor beyond Athenry.  My Department is currently at an advanced stage in developing an approach for progressing such a review in line with these commitments, and I expect to be in a position shortly to decide on the approach to be taken.  I am cognisant of the need for stakeholder consultation as part of the process and can assure the Deputy that this will be an integral part of the review's arrangements.</p>  <p>  Also looking ahead, the European Commission, in reviewing the implementation of the TEN-T core network by end 2023 and in consultation with Member States, will evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows and national investment planning.</p>  <p>  In relation to Ireland West Airport, Knock, as one of our smaller airports that provide scheduled passenger air services, the taxpayer has supported Knock Airport for many years with funding for its operations.  This support for Knock, and for the other regional airports, will continue under Project Ireland 2040 through my Department&rsquo;s Regional Airports Programme. This Programme provides financial support towards safety and security projects and activities at these airports and indeed Project Ireland 2040 recognises that, given its scale of operation, Knock Airport plays a more regional role in terms of international access than the other smaller airports given its location in the North-west.</p></reply>

The key objective of Priority Area 5, Access for All, is to ensure the provision of fully accessible transport services on all services with a target to achieve at least 95% fully accessible trips by 2020 within the Rural Transport Programme. In this regard the retendering of all existing Local Link services is expected to be concluded shortly and the process has included a provision that all services must be fully wheelchair accessible within 2 years of contract award. </p>  <p>  In relation to Action 102 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), which is assigned to the NTA, the Authority is undertaking a tender competition for a potential new (single deck) medium distance bus/coach type vehicle which would allow wheelchair users to board with normal ramp access on Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO services. The vehicles being sought are intended for routes up to 50km, being regional commuter routes and could replace the existing high floor type coach which requires an external wheelchair lift. It will not be possible to definitively confirm the availability of satisfactory vehicles until the tender process concludes. </p>  <p>  The conclusions from this tender process will also inform a review by the NTA of the issue of wheelchair accessibility on commercial licensed bus/coach services.

Attempts by Tusla to secure continuing commercial cover have proved unsuccessful. However,  I am pleased to confirm that pending a permanent solution, all foster carers have an indemnity on an individual basis where required.  This is on an ex-gratia basis as a temporary measure to address immediate individual cases while the overall indemnification issues are being resolved. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, I am fully supportive of extending the State Indemnity Scheme under the State Claims Agency to foster parents.  Unfortunately, this has taken longer than expected due to technical issues associated with the approvals and statutory process involved, but I can assure the Deputy that work is continuing to address these matters and legal advices are expected shortly.  My Department has been in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter, and my intention is to include foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  My Department has written to the Irish Foster Carers Association (IFCA) outlining the position and, through the Association, foster carers have been informed as to the current position. A further meeting with the Irish Foster Care Association and officials from my Department was held yesterday at which the most up to date position was presented to the IFCA. In addition, I understand that Tusla will also make publicly available the information provided to IFCA so as to communicate the position to those foster carers who are not members of that association.</p></reply>

Project Ireland prioritises the wellbeing of all of our people, wherever they live and whatever their background.  The NPF seeks to ensure that the population and economic growth which will take place in Ireland to 2040 is shared more evenly across the regions, and it is explicitly stated that securing regional balance is the fundamental purpose of the NPF. </p>  <p>  The NDP outlines a programme of capital investment to 2027 which supports the objectives of the NPF.  The NDP sets out investment across sectors such as transport, energy, communications and tourism that will support both regional development and rural development. </p>  <p>  For example, one of the ten strategic outcomes in the NPF is Enhanced Regional Accessibility.  To support this outcome, the NDP sets out funding of &euro;7.3 billion for investment in regional roads and accessibility to the North-West. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the NDP sets out funding of &euro;8.8 billion to support the NPF strategic outcome of Empowered Rural Economies and Communities.  This includes investment in broadband, agriculture and tourism, as well as the establishment of a new Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which will provide an additional &euro;1 billion over the next ten years to support the development of our smaller towns, villages and rural areas.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the campaign referred to by the Deputy.  It is very encouraging to see young people engaged in the debate around rural and regional development and seeking to ensure that they have the opportunities that they deserve within their own regions.  Realising these opportunities is very much the objective of the NPF and NDP.  Delivering the strategic outcomes of the NPF will ensure that we achieve regional balance and prosperity for all areas of the country for the future.</p></reply>

The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in this legislation when conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.</p>  <p>  One of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable citizens to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC.   It simply gives individuals the option to use their PSC if they wished, as proof of identity and/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.</p>  <p>  It is clear from customer feedback that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-specified bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a passport or driver&rsquo;s license which they might not have and which attracts a cost.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge. </p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity, therefore, the Deputy should note that this proposal in no way allows nor can a private sector body access the customer data on the card or on any Government database. It simply provides for the card be accepted as a form of identity verification by a private sector organisation or non-specified body - but only at the sole discretion of the card holder.   Far from undermining privacy, I believe that this approach gives power to the individual to control access to and use of their PSC.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p>  <p>  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p>  <p>  Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for the period January to April 2018 are 29.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.3 weeks for a summary decision.</p>  <p>  A number of new appeals officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to longer times to conclude in the first four months of 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. </p>  <p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Once claims are in payment, the Department periodically reviews them to ensure that there is continued entitlement. Depending on the circumstances in each case and to make best use of resources, a review may only concentrate on a specific condition of entitlement. </p><p>Means are any income belonging to the carer and their spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant, property, (except their own home) or an asset that could bring in money or provide them with an income, for example occupational pensions, or pensions or benefits from another country.</p><p>Following a review, CA was disallowed and her payment stopped as her means of &euro;325.17 exceeded the statutory limit.</p><p>The person concerned was notified on 14 April 2018 of this decision the reason for it and her right of review and appeal. </p><p>The person concerned has not requested a review of this decision.</p><p>The person concerned continues to receive a domiciliary care allowance (DCA).  DCA is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. It is not means tested.</p><p>While receiving DCA, the person concerned will continue to receive the annual carer&rsquo;s support grant, which is payable on the first Thursday in June each year.</p><p>It would also be open to the spouse of the person concerned to apply for carer&rsquo;s leave from his employment.  The Carer's Leave Act 2001 allows employees to leave their employment temporarily to provide full-time care for someone in need of full-time care and attention. They may be entitled to take carer&rsquo;s leave of at least 13 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.  </p><p>While on this leave, they may be entitled to carer&rsquo;s benefit (CARB) which is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care and attention.  It is not means-tested but based on the PRSI paid by the employee.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To do this, the Government will introduce from 2020 a &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA) for the State Pension (Contributory).  The TCA is advanced as a more logical and transparent system, where the individual&rsquo;s lifetime contribution will more closely match the benefit received.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome. </p>  <p>  The model of TCA which will be in place for all new pensioners from 2020 will be decided upon following a period of public consultation that will be launched shortly.  As the outcome of this process and the Government decision and legislation which will follow it cannot be pre-empted, I cannot say how particular sets of circumstances may be affected. However, I can say that the percentage rate paid to pensioners will vary depending on their PRSI records.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 defines a contract of employment as a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  </p>  <p>  Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, certain reckonable components may be taken into account in determining an employee&rsquo;s average hourly rate.  In this context, if an employer provides an employee with full board and lodgings, or lodgings only or full board only, a fixed monetary allowance can be included as reckonable pay (this amount is prescribed by Statutory Instrument). </p>  <p>  In 2017 the Low Pay Commission published a report on the allowances provided for board and lodgings under the National Minimum Wage Act.  The Commission drew a number of conclusions from its examination of the history, background and operation of the board and lodgings offset, and from the submissions and oral evidence presented to it by workers, employers and WRC enforcement officers.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s findings included that </p>  <p>  - the allowances do not reflect market value and it was not intended that they would do so; </p>  <p>  - the allowances are intended as a form of protection for minimum wage workers against exploitation, and as recognition to employers that there is a cost to the provision of board and lodgings to employees.</p>  <p>The report (available in full at www.lowpaycommission.ie/Publications) also noted that the allowances are not in widespread use and the number of people affected by the allowances is relatively small. </p>  <p>  While the Low Pay Commission did not recommend an immediate or specific change in the allowances, it did recommend the retention of the allowances, and that &ldquo;in future the rate may be reviewed annually in conjunction with the review of the National Minimum Wage&rdquo;.  The recommendations of the Commission were considered and accepted by Government.  The changes recommended by the Low Pay Commission were brought into force by an Order signed by me on 11 October 2017 (and the changes came into effect from 1 January 2018).  I also provided for an increase in the allowances of 3.2%, an increase that was in line with the increase in the national minimum wage which also came into effect on 1 January.</p>  <p>  The rates currently provided (under S.I. No. 440 of 2017 (National Minimum Wage Order 2017)) are:</p>  <p>  (i) for board only, &euro;0.85 per hour worked</p>  <p>  (ii) for lodgings only, &euro;22.56 per week, or &euro;3.24 per day.</p>  <p>  These rates do not only relate to Au Pairs but to any employee engaged on a contract of employment as defined in the National Minimum Wage Act.  I currently have no plans to legislate to define a specific category of worker to which these rates apply.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.  For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001.  There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and</p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,054 per month in Q4 2017).</p><p>On 21 March 2018, the RTB published its Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 4 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country.  This allows all interested parties to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.</p><p>The data from the Rent Index Report relating to Limerick City are detailed in the following table:<table><tr><th>Local Electoral Area</th><th>Quarters &amp;gt;  7%</th><th>Average 2017 Q4 (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Limerick City East</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;1,039.82</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City North </td><td>6</td><td>&euro;862.98</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City West </td><td>4</td><td>&euro;961.48</td></tr></table></p><p>In each of the three Limerick Electoral Areas, the average monthly rent is below the national standardised rent of &euro;1,054 per month.

In two of the regions, individuals and families who were being accommodated in private houses/apartments rented by the local authorities were removed from the March report with the agreement of the relevant authorities.

Cost recovery must have regard to an economic analysis of the costs associated with the provision of water services, including long-term forecasts undertaken for the purpose of Article 5 and Annex III of the Directive.</p>  <p>  Article 9 also sets out the need to ensure adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and for an adequate contribution of the different water users (industry, households and agriculture) to the recovery of costs.  Furthermore, Article 9 allows members states, where it is established practice, to not apply the provisions of cost recovery where this does not compromise the purpose and objectives of the Directive.</p>  <p>  In summary, it is necessary to ensure that cost recovery systems are in place that are adequate to meet the long-term investment needs for the provision of safe drinking water and adequate urban waste water treatment in order to meet required public health and environmental needs, and also that these systems promote efficient water use and avoid wastage.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the special Oireachtas Committee, which provided for the suspension of domestic water charges and the funding of normal domestic water usage through general taxation, including application of an excess charge for water use above an agreed threshold, and the supporting legislation enacted through the Water Services Act 2017 address the requirements of the Directive and, in particular, ensure that water resources will be used efficiently and not wasted.</p>  <p>  In relation to the previous River Basin Management Plan which covered the period 2009 to 2015, it gave a commitment to the introduction of legislation that would enable local authorities to charge domestic water users for water services in a manner which provides incentives for efficient water use and which recovers an adequate contribution of the costs of water services.  The River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021 published recently updates this position by reflecting the legislative position in the Water Services Act 2017.</p></reply>

It is available in all local authority areas and its introduction now ensures that all social housing supports can be accessed through the local authorities, allowing tenants to take up full-time employment and keep their housing support, subject to adjustment of their differential rent.</p><p>The qualification criteria for social housing support are set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and in the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended, and are applied by all housing authorities in assessing individual households for support.</p><p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for eligibility for social housing supports in each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.  There are currently three bands &ndash; with maximum income limits per individual (main applicant) set at &euro;35,000, &euro;30,000 and &euro;25,000 (the limits are higher for households with multiple adults and with children).</p><p>Each housing authority is responsible, under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, for determining the rent for its dwellings, subject to complying with broad principles laid down by this Department.  Authorities set out how their rent is determined in their Differential Rent Schemes, the administration of which is a matter for each housing authority; I as Minister have no role in relation to this matter.  The reviewing of local authority housing rents and the collection of rents from tenants is also a matter for individual local authorities.</p><p>There are currently over 36,000 households in receipt of HAP and over 20,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.

To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to accommodate some 42,500 homes nationally.  The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in the ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes.</p><p>The map is the result of the collation of data by my Department from local authorities, the Housing Agency, and other State and Semi-State bodies.  All of the mapped sites can be viewed at the following link: .</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland mapping project is, by its nature, iterative and requires regular updating by local authorities and other land owners to ensure changing circumstances are reflected.  In addition, all local authorities and the Housing Agency have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for housing lands in their ownership, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.  These plans are close to finalisation and will be published in due course.</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland map represents a vital initial step in shaping and informing a significant policy shift towards maximising the State land potential to contribute to key housing and planning policies such as securing more compact and sustainable growth, as signalled in Project Ireland 2040, which requires significantly more effective land management in key development areas.</p><p>Against that background, it is proposed to establish a National Regeneration and Development Agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land.  Detailed arrangements in relation to the functions, powers and mechanisms for the establishment of the Agency are currently being developed by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with a view to their finalisation and implementation at the earliest available opportunity.</p></reply>

The data provided by the Census is a valuable starting point for the work of my Department but as it includes short-term vacancy (e.g. property for sale or between tenancies on the night of the Census) and complex vacancy issues (e.g. probate), it is important to build on that data to derive the more targeted data that local authorities need in order to tackle vacancy effectively.</p>  <p>  Waterford City and County Council are particularly proactive regarding vacancy and their housing staff carried out a survey on housing units in 17 small areas in August 2017 to verify the level of vacancy in urban, rural and semi urban areas. In total, 2,039 properties were surveyed and this indicated that 241 properties were vacant.  Waterford City and County Council is continuing to engage with owners of those properties to advise on the funding initiatives and schemes available to facilitate the re-introduction of those properties into the liveable housing stock.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the CSO, the Housing Agency and the local government sector to identify the subset of the headline vacancy figures provided by the Census that represent housing units capable of being brought back into use quickly, particularly in areas of high housing need.  The key focus is to enable local authorities to quickly identify any vacancy hotspots in their areas so that existing empty housing stock can be re-used and provide much needed homes.</p>  <p>  To this end, my Department will shortly be conducting a pilot field survey in specific local authorities, including Waterford City and County Council, based on a uniform methodology developed with the CSO, Housing Agency and the local government sector.  This pilot survey will aim to identify vacant homes that are recoverable into the useable housing stock.  On completion of the pilot field-based survey and examination of its outputs, consideration will be given to rolling out the survey further across other areas.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.

The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p>  <p>  To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a Loan to Value ratio of 90% applies to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan as per the Central Bank's prudential lending guidelines.  Therefore, in order to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property.</p>  <p>  Applicants must provide bank or similar statements (such as post office, credit union etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application, clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings.  The cash savings should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property.  Gifts are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property, where their source is verified.</p>  <p>  Exceptions to the above can be made where an applicant/applicants can clearly demonstrate a consistent and credible record of savings or rent payment through their bank account which at a minimum is equal to:</p>  <p>  - In the case of a fixed rate loan, the proposed monthly loan repayment, or</p>  <p>  - In the case of a variable rate loan, the proposed stress-tested monthly loan repayment.</p>  <p>  For prospective purchasers of newly-built properties, the availability, through the Revenue Commissioners, of the Help to Buy Initiative for first-time buyers may provide additional assistance to prospective applicants for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  Regarding the information available to prospective applicants on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website, I am aware of issues concerning the inclusion of the specific deposit requirements on the website.  I have recently met with the Chief Executives of the two main agencies involved in the implementation of the scheme, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, and I have requested that they address a number of issues to improve the operation of the scheme, including the provision of additional information on-line in relation to the deposit requirements of the scheme.  This will give potential applicants a clearer indication of the deposit amount that they are required to have under the terms of the scheme.</p></reply>

As a result of this engagement, the online calculator on www.rebuildingirelandhomeloan.ie has recently been updated to include the cost of mortgage protection insurance (MPI), when calculating the total loan amount that an applicant may be eligible to borrow under the scheme. As noted on the website, this calculator gives indicative results for illustrative and guidance purposes only and is not an offer of a loan.</p>  <p>  In relation to the cost of coverage under the Local Authority Mortgage Protection Insurance scheme, it is a statutory requirement that MPI is taken out in respect of all local authority housing loans. This scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Insurance Committee, and has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p>  <p>  The local authority MPI is designed to provide an appropriate level of insurance cover to those who wish to avail of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. It offers a number of additional features over and above the standard MPI products available on the market. Standard MPI products are individually priced, based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement, offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme also provides other benefits over standard MPI products. These include the payment of mortgage repayments if there is a valid claim as a result of disability; an additional payment of &euro;3,000 in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, separate to life cover; and members are also covered for death up to age 75 rather than 65 as is the case under standard MPI cover.</p></reply>

By various Ministerial Directions since 2005, a percentage of fees received by the RTB under the Act has been allocated for transfer to local authorities for the purpose of the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to private rented accommodation, including rental standards inspections. </p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2016, the RTB retains the entirety of fees received under the Act to defray its costs; however, sufficient surplus funds were available to continue support for local authority inspections of rental accommodation until the end of 2017.

My Department has recently written to all Local Authority Chief Executives, requesting implementation plans showing how they plan to increase inspection figures in the short, medium and long term with the objective to achieve the target by 2021 of inspecting 25% of all rental properties annually. I have secured &euro;2.5m in Exchequer funding in 2018 to facilitate the increased inspections planned for this year on the path towards the 2021 objective.</p></reply>

I expect that the Regional Strategies will be published for consultation by the middle of this year and finalised by year end or early in 2019. Following the adoption of each of the three RSESs by the respective Regional Assemblies, each Local Authority will be required to review their statutory land use plans, in accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). </p>  <p>  No instruction has issued from my Department related to the de-zoning of lands on foot of the publication of the NPF. It is through the review process outlined above that the quantum of zoned land, including residential, can be fully quantified and determined. This approach was outlined to all 31 Local Authorities when they were briefed on the NPF by my Department over the course of March 2018.</p></reply>

The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica.  The deleterious material in Mayo was primarily reactive pyrite.  </p><p>A total of 5 engineering solutions have been proposed by the panel, as remedial solutions to address the problem ranging from removal and replacement of the outer leaf of affected walls only to complete rebuild of the dwelling.</p><p>The panel found that it is mainly private homes that are affected; however, there are also problems within the social housing stock in both counties which continue to be investigated. </p><p>My Department is prioritising the implementation of Recommendations 1 and 2. </p><p>With regard to Recommendation 1, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) Technical Committee, established to scope and fast track the development of a standardised protocol, held its inaugural meeting on 11 September 2017 and has held several further meetings since. The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders. My Department understands from the NSAI that the Technical Committee is in the process of finalising the standardised protocol, which will be available for public consultation shortly.  The public consultation will run for a period of six weeks.  </p><p>In relation to the pilot remediation project in North County Mayo referred to, this is in respect of one unit of Mayo County Council social housing stock.  The project was proposed to ascertain in more detail the extent of damage and the scope of works which will be necessary to carry out effective remediation for all of the remaining social housing units affected. It is expected that the experience gained on this remediation project will also assist the development of remedial solutions for all affected householders.</p><p>It should be noted that construction projects progressing through the 4-stage approval process are reviewed at each stage by my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Delivery team, including architectural and quantity surveyor advisors.

They set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with a disability through mainstream housing policy.  The Strategy, which identified 9 Strategic Aims supported by a number of priority actions and key measures, was affirmed in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and extended to 2020 to continue to deliver on its aims.  </p><p>Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Accordingly, the day-to-day operation of the social housing system, including assessments for social housing support, is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Information on the number of households qualified for and in need of social housing support whose need has not been met is set out in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) which, since 2016, is carried out annually.  The most recent assessment was carried out in 2017, full details of which are available on my Department's website, at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>The following table shows the total number of households in each of the most recent summary of assessments for 2017 that were identified as having a housing need based on a disability: <table><tr><th>SSHA</th><th>Basis of Need - Disability</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>3,938</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>5,753</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>5,772</td></tr></table></p><p>The increase in numbers shows that people with disabilities are now applying to local authorities in greater numbers than before, particularly since 2013, indicating a greater awareness of the social housing supports available.  The increase in numbers seeking assessment of their housing needs can be attributed in no small part to the development of the National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Housing Provision for People with a Disability, which were adopted for implementation by local authorities in 2014. Following an extensive consultation with stakeholders, my Department issued revised Guidelines to local authorities in October 2017; these are available at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Additionally, in furthering the objectives of the NHSPWD, the Housing Agency has published a number of documents to support people with disabilities to access social housing supports through local authorities. These include &quot;Housing Options&quot;<i></i>and &quot;An Easy to Read Guide<b></b>to filling in the Social Housing Support Application Form&quot;.  All documents are available on the websites of the Housing Agency, the local authorities and Citizens' Information.  Work is also underway on Easy Read versions of the Housing Adaptation Grants<b></b>forms and the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), which will be available shortly.</p><p>In accordance with the vision and strategic aims of the NHSPWD to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level, Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) have been established in all local authority areas.  These are chaired by the Directors of Housing with membership including the HSE and disability representatives.  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet the identified and emerging housing needs of people with disabilities in their areas with a view to developing annual targets for the delivery of housing to people with a disability on their housing waiting lists.  All Plans are now operational in each local authority and the majority of them have already been published on the relevant local authority websites with the remainder due to be published in due course.  These Plans, along with the Summary of Social Housing Assessments, allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing mechanisms.  My Department does not hold data on the number of units of accommodation provided specifically for people with disabilities.  </p><p>Priority action 1.3 of the Framework is to &ldquo;promote the increased use of the private rental sector to meet the housing needs of people with disabilities&rdquo;.  There are three key measures under this Action, including Action 1.3.2 &ldquo;Awareness raising campaigns will be undertaken amongst private landlords and letting agents regarding renting to people with disabilities&rdquo;.  In tandem with the work of the HDSG&rsquo;s, accommodation solutions for people with disabilities are being put in place through schemes such as the Long Term Leasing Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Additional leasing initiatives have been developed such as the Repair and Leasing scheme launched in 2017 and the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme launched in January 2018.  Under the Enhanced Leasing Scheme, the extent to which proposals make provision for wheelchair accessible properties is specifically taken into account. The annual targets under the Local Housing and Disability Strategies will ensure that a proportion of the properties leased from private landlords/developers will be allocated to people with a disability.</p><p>Local authorities also support households with a disability through the Housing Assistance Payment.  This scheme has been widely promoted to private landlords.  Currently a working group set up under the NHSPWD is scoping out work on key measure 1.3.2 as part of their workplan for 2018, including the potential role of an awareness campaign.It is also intended to seek the views of private landlords and letting agents on their experiences renting to people with a disability.  The work on this key measure is due for completion by Q4 2018.  </p><p>The supports put in place since the launch of the Strategy in 2011, together with substantial funding  provided by my Department, point to tangible progress for housing for people with disabilities and accord with the Programme for Government commitment to improve the lives of people with disabilities.</p></reply>

The National Archives have advised my Department that in 1910 legislation did not cover the preservation of records other that court records.  Based on the information given by the Deputy, the documents relating to this investigation, if they still exist, could be in a number of places.</p>  <p>  The majority of documents relating to investigations into accidents by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) such as the one referred to by the Deputy, if they were still in existence in 1922, would have been transferred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Independence.  If investigation notes survive, they could be with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Museum and Archives, but I understand that the possibility of this is extremely slim.</p>  <p>  In some cases, particularly if foul play was suspected by the RIC, the papers would have been transferred to the Chief Secretary&rsquo;s Office (CSO) in Dublin.  If this happened, the documents would have been preserved in the Chief Secretary's Office Registered Papers".  The practice in the CSO was to transfer its records to the State Paper Office when the records became 20 years old so that documents relating to this 1910 investigation would have been due for transfer to the State Paper Office in 1930.  </p>  <p>  If the RIC sent the documents relating to this case, to the Chief Secretary's Office, they would still have been in that Office in 1922 when it was being wound up at Independence and would most likely have been transferred to London.  If such transferred records survive now, they would be in the UK National Archives.</p>  <p>  In 1986, all documents held in the State Paper Office were transferred to the National Archives on its establishment under the National Archives Act 1986.  If the documents had been transferred (early) by the Chief Secretary's Office to the State Paper Office in or before 1922, then they would now be held in the National Archives.  </p>  <p>  Officials in the National Archives are reviewing registers to check for these documents.</p></reply>

It should be noted that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department licenses hunting of deer, the Department does not own the deer population. They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.</p>  <p>  With regard to calls for increased fencing relating to alleged incidents of deer presence on public roads in County Kerry, my Department has no plans to fence the national park. Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and  it is not part of the remit of the Department to cordon them onto specific areas of land. Moreover, fencing the national park would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons. The presence of deer is not confined to the national parks and so fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management. Sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is 8 inches off the ground, while red deer are capable of knocking fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds</p>  <p>  The erection of a fence could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park. There are many deer outside the park boundaries which would still be capable of running into the path of motorists. My Department is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved, possibly larger, signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists in remaining vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected. My officials have discussed this with Kerry County Council in 2016 and 2017 and the council undertook to improve sight lines in the Ballydowney area for the benefit of motorists. Additional or relocated advance deer warning signs, or both, may also be provided by the local authority but that is a matter for them.</p></reply>

Accordingly, my Department carries out predator control programmes on land it owns or manages and this includes mink where the need is identified.  </p>  <p>  Following observation of bird mortality on Great Blasket Island, in 2014 my Department, commenced a programme of trapping of American Mink on Great Blasket. Over a three year period to 2016, some 48 mink were captured.  The last 3 occasions on which traps were set and inspected, no mink were found. This suggests that the population control measure has been relatively successful. Traps are due be set again on the island shortly.</p></reply>
