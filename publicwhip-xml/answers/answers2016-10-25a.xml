This is critical to save the lives of Syrian citizens, particularly those who remain in Aleppo.</p><p>EU Ministers were also united that the situation in Syria should be referred to the International Criminal Court in order to ensure legal accountability for the victims of the unspeakable crimes that have been committed against them.<i></i>I believe that the only viable and sustainable way forward remains a comprehensive end to violence and a Syrian-own and Syrian-led political resolution, based on a real political transition process.  That remains my objective and that of the EU, and is reflected in the conclusions adopted by the FAC.</p><p>At last week's European Council, in the context of discussion of the conflict in Syria, the EU's Heads of State and Government stated that &ldquo;the EU is considering all available options, should the current atrocities continue&rdquo;.  There are currently no specific proposals for Syria-related sanctions. </p><p>Clearly all available options can include sanctions and Ireland will be open to considering proposals for sanctions should the atrocities against the people of Aleppo continue.</p><p>As I informed the D&aacute;il in my address on 20 October, it is a matter of the gravest concern to me that a permanent member of the Security Council, with a duty to the United Nations to uphold international law and the principles of the UN Charter could condone or engage in the bombardment on Aleppo, which as the EU stated on Monday may amount to war crimes. </p><p>I utterly condemn the actions by the Assad regime and its allies, including Russia, in Aleppo, and demand the immediate end to the bombardment of that city, the end of the siege of eastern Aleppo and the lifting of all restrictions on humanitarian assistance in Aleppo and across Syria.</p></reply>

I expect that we will have a further substantive discussion with our Northern Ireland colleagues on the implications of the UK referendum result.  The agenda will also cover discussions on economic and financial matters, as well as a range of other issues including the North West Gateway Initiative and the North/South commitments made under the Fresh Start Agreement of November 2015.</p>  <p>  At the Plenary meeting of the NSMC on 4 July in Dublin Castle, the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are protected and advanced and that the benefits of North/South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements which emerge as regards the United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union.</p>  <p>  We noted that there are a number of priority areas where implications arise, including the economy and trade, Northern Ireland and British Irish Relations and the Common Travel Area.</p>  <p>  We agreed that a full audit will be undertaken in all sectors to identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising in the phases preceding and following the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  And we agreed that this work would be submitted to ministerial sectoral meetings for consideration as to the strategic and cross-cutting issues arising.  The ongoing work to achieve these objectives will be reviewed by the Council when it meets in plenary format in November in Armagh.</p>  <p>  The North South Ministerial Council is one of a number of fora, alongside the British Irish Council and the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, within which it will be possible to discuss with our colleagues from Northern Ireland the implications of the UK referendum vote.  In addition, the issue has been discussed and will continue to be discussed in bilateral contacts with the Northern Ireland Executive and with other party leaders in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is the Government's intention to maintain close contact with the Northern Ireland Executive in the period ahead using all appropriate channels, both formal and informal.</p></reply>

Minister Flanagan outlined the Government's concerns to the Chair and members of the Board of Goal in a meeting last month.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been closely engaged with the Board of Goal since these issues emerged.</p>  <p>  Given the seriousness of the issues involved, we indicated to Goal that the Department would withhold a total of &euro;10.1 million in planned humanitarian and development funding for the organisation, pending greater clarity on the issues raised in the investigation and on Goal's plans to address them.   </p>  <p>  I believe that the Chair and Board of Goal are making determined efforts to address this situation.  They recognise the need to demonstrate that the organisation can meet the governance standards which the Irish public expects of the NGOs it so consistently and generously supports for their humanitarian and development work.  </p>  <p>  Last week, Goal announced the appointment of an interim General Manager to assist in the process of organisational reform.  I welcome that.  I understand she will take up her position on 1 November, and my officials will be in contact with her.</p>  <p>  The Department is also maintaining regular contact with the Board of Goal on its plans, and with the US authorities and other international donors.</p></reply>

Ireland is also represented in Iran by an Honorary Consul.</p>  <p>  The configuration and scale of the State's diplomatic and consular network is kept under ongoing review by the Government.  A range of factors are taken into account in considering our diplomatic representation overseas, including our national political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  The Government is of course conscious of the political, economic and trade factors that might warrant the opening of a resident diplomatic mission in Iran &ndash; as in a number of other countries.

Its aim is to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of Syrian refugees in Turkey and to bring about long term sustainable improvements in their health, education and self-reliance.</p>  <p>  The Facility was established with &euro;1 billion in funding from the EU budget and &euro;2 billion from the budgets of Member States. Member State contributions are mandatory and calculated on the basis of Gross National Income.  Ireland will be contributing a total of almost &euro;23 million to the Facility from our development aid budget between 2016 and 2019.  Ireland is a member of the Facility's steering committee and we are working to ensure that the Facility is used in a way which is fully compatible with its agreed strategic framework and which respects the human rights of all concerned.</p>  <p>  The Facility is making a difference in the lives of refugees on the ground in Turkey.  For instance, two contracts worth a total of &euro;600 million were signed at the end of September which will provide almost half a million Syrian children with access to education and allow two million people access to primary healthcare services. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the &euro;3 million which we will provide between 2016 and 2020 for the EU's Emergency Trust Fund on the Root Causes of Irregular Migration in Africa, is aimed at meeting immediate needs and at enabling longer-term development.  Ireland is an active member of the Operational Committee for the Horn of Africa window of this Trust Fund and we use this membership to ensure that the focus on addressing root causes remains central to the work of the Fund.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-25a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102500057#WRA02400"><p>Since the outset of the Syrian conflict, Ireland has consistently supported a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led political resolution to the conflict.  The Syrian people must have the freedom to exercise their rights, including the democratic right to choose their own national leaders.  These principles &ndash; set out clearly in Geneva in 2012 &ndash; have guided my interventions on Syria in Brussels and at the UN in New York, including my address to the General Assembly and in bilateral meetings with our international partners.</p>  <p>  Ireland stands ready to play a positive role in any post-conflict peace effort.  My EU colleagues and I spoke on 17 October with UN Special Envoy de Mistura, underlining our continuing and strong support for his efforts to stem the destruction of Syria and her people.  The Taoiseach discussed the EU's response to the crisis at the European Council last week.</p>  <p>  I continue to press for accountability, both to provide the victims with the hope of redress and in the hope that it will deter those involved from worse atrocities.  This has been central to our interventions at the UN in New York and Geneva. </p>  <p>  Ireland's response to the Syrian crisis and the plight of the Syrian people over the last five years has been unprecedented, providing more than &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region to date.  This support has been channelled through a range of partners, including NGOs, UN organisations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, who are best placed to respond, often by linking with local civil society organisations on the ground to get aid to hard-to-reach areas. </p>  <p>  Together with our EU partners, we remain engaged through the EU in the International Syria Support Group.  As I stated in my address last month to the UN, Ireland remains strongly committed to supporting the efforts of the UN to achieve both an end to the crisis and a sustainable peaceful resolution.</p></reply>

The French authorities have recently announced that they will close the unofficial migrant camp in Calais by the end of this year and will move the approximately 9,000 inhabitants to new accommodation in reception centres across the country.  This is being done to protect the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure dignified conditions for the migrants and refugees currently living in the Calais camp, including unaccompanied minors.  President Hollande has said that the objectives of these actions are to &ldquo;guarantee the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure for the migrants and refugees that conditions are dignified&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  I have confidence in the French authorities' abilities to deal with this situation. I have no plans to establish a temporary consulate in Calais. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Government Decision to establish the programme recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date under both the resettlement and relocation elements of the programme are children with one or two parents.  When we talk about the Irish Refugee Protection Programme we are referring to relocation from Italy and Greece and resettlement under the UNHCR-led programme which is currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Lebanon. </p>  <p>  Issues related to the settlement of unaccompanied minors and other foreign nationals in Ireland are matters for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. </p></reply>

Since 2012, Ireland has provided a total of &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region.  At present, it is Ireland's largest response to any humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;20 million in funding provided by Ireland so far in 2016, &euro;14 million has been delivered through the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, and &euro;6 million through the Department of Agriculture's support to the World Food Programme's Syria response.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid funding seeks to meet the needs of those inside Syria, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have fled to neighbouring countries, in particular Lebanon and Jordan.  Funding is channelled through a range of partners, including NGOs, UN organisations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, who are best placed to respond.  These partners provide humanitarian supplies and urgently-needed health, education, water and sanitation services, as well as support measures to protect children and vulnerable families. </p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU's humanitarian response in Syria, to which &euro;445 million has been pledged in 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps have been deployed to the Balkans and Middle East, providing much-needed surge capacity to UN agencies responding to migration challenges resulting from the Syrian conflict. </p>  <p>  We are continuing to monitor the situation closely and, given its complexity and severity, I would expect that we will be providing additional support for people affected by the crisis in the coming months. </p></reply>

Our opinion is that the embargo serves no constructive purpose.  We maintain our view that it is the right of Cuban citizens to decide independently on their future and the Government has been clear on this point in our international contacts.</p>  <p>  At the same time we have also consistently called on the Cuban Government to fully grant its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms.</p>  <p>  The past two years have seen immense progress in US-Cuba relations, including President Obama's historic visit to Havana in March 2016.  In addition to the full restoration of diplomatic relations there have been significant agreements between the two sides in relation to communications and travel between the US and Cuba.  Recent US Government decisions have relaxed restrictions in relation to certain telecommunications, internet and financial services as well as building materials and the first commercial flight between the US and Cuba in more than 50 years took place on 31 August, 2016.  Discussions are ongoing between the two parties on a range of bilateral issues. </p>  <p>  Despite these positive developments, fundamental restrictive measures remain in place.  The US embargo on Cuba is codified in legislation, and therefore requires the approval of the US Congress in order to rescind it.  President Obama has repeatedly called on Congress to end the embargo, not least during his visit to Havana this year.  </p>  <p>  On 27 October 2015, Ireland joined all other European Union member states in voting in favour of a Cuban resolution at the UN General Assembly in New York, calling for an end to the US embargo on Cuba.  Consistent with our policy on this issue, it is the Government's intention to vote for a further resolution on ending the embargo in the UN in the coming days. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to have the opportunity to discuss these issues as well as positive developments in Ireland-Cuba relations with the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bruno Rodr&iacute;guez Parrilla, en marge of the UN General Assembly in September.</p></reply>

The Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on 17 October adopted Conclusions expressing deep concern at the political situation and condemning the acts of extreme violence that took place on 19 and 20 September.</p>  <p>  The Conclusions stress that the political crisis in the DRC can only be resolved through a substantive, inclusive, impartial and transparent political dialogue, which must lead to the holding of presidential and legislative elections as soon as possible in 2017.  If the current Presidential term comes to an end without prior agreement on the electoral calendar, the EU will need to consider the impact on its relations with the Government of DRC.</p>  <p>  The Conclusions also underline the EU's concern about the obstacles to a peaceful and democratic transition and reiterate that, to ensure a climate conducive to the holding of dialogue and elections, the Government of the DRC must make a clear commitment to ensure respect for human rights and the rule of law.  The Conclusions further call on all involved to reject the use of violence and ensure respect for fundamental freedoms. </p>  <p>  An African Union-facilitated national dialogue, supported by the EU, is working to find a consensual solution for the holding of peaceful, transparent and credible elections.  </p>  <p>  In addition to engagement at the EU level, the issue of electoral tensions was raised by the Irish side at a meeting earlier this year between officials of my Department and representatives from the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Congo in London, stressing the importance of timely elections and peaceful cooperation between all parties.  Ireland also raised the issue at the Human Rights Council in September, urging the Government of DRC to move forward the processes for the upcoming election and political transition, in the interests of the Congolese people and the maintenance of peace and stability. </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided very significant levels of funding to the DRC: &euro;44.61 million in total between 2010 and 2015.  Of this, &euro;30.02 million was in humanitarian assistance, including &euro;24.3 million allocated to the UN Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC, and the remainder through NGO partners.  &euro;14.59 million was allocated to a range of civil society partners for their work on human rights, democracy, peace building and rule of law in DRC.  To date in 2016, we have provided over &euro;4.8 million in humanitarian funding to the DRC.  </p>  <p>  Irish Aid has deployed two rapid response personnel to DRC this year.

Our policy for international development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) in Official Development Assistance (ODA) as economic conditions allow.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government further sets out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit.  It is important that such progress is made in a sustainable and manageable way which strengthens Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight to end global poverty and hunger.</p>  <p>  In the very difficult economic circumstances of recent years, the Government managed to stabilise and protect allocations to ODA.  We made annual contributions to ODA in excess of &euro;600 million and consistently stated that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target as economic conditions allowed.  </p>  <p>  As the economic recovery consolidates, we have managed to increase funding for ODA by &euro;40 million for 2016 and by a further &euro;10 million for 2017.  The total allocation for ODA for 2017 will therefore be &euro;651 million, bringing to just under &euro;4.5 billion the total amount of public funding provided for Ireland's development assistance over the period 2011 to 2017.</p>  <p>  The revised Department of Finance forecasts for GNP mean that the percentage provided for ODA in 2016 is likely to be in the region of 0.3%.

The request was filed with the Court on 4 December 2014. On the basis of new material uncovered, the Government has contended that the ill-treatment suffered by the Hooded Men should be recognised as torture.  The Government's request currently remains under consideration by the Court.</p>  <p>  In March this year the UK were invited by the Court to submit observations on a number of questions posed by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>  <p>  At the request of the UK, the deadline for submission of their observations has been extended by the Court from time to time and now stands at 15 December 2016.  The UK observations will in due course be made available to the Government and an opportunity afforded for reply.  This is the procedure for progressing the Government's request to the European Court of Human Rights and therefore there have not been ancillary discussions with the UK on this case.</p>  <p>  The European Court of Human Rights has advised that the further procedure regarding the Government's request for a revision of the 1978 judgment will be determined upon receipt of both parties' observations.</p>  <p>  This decision to request the European Court of Human Rights to revise its 1978 judgment was not taken lightly.  The Government is acutely aware of the suffering of the individual men involved and of their families, of the significance of this case, and of the weight of these allegations.</p>  <p>  The Government is also conscious that, in the Council of Europe, the European Union, and in other fora, Ireland and the UK as strong bilateral partners have worked together to promote human rights, and will continue to do so.  Both Governments have worked hard over many years to build stronger, more trusting relations.  I believe that this relationship stands to us both in working through the serious matters raised in the Government's request to the European Court of Human Rights on the Hooded Men case.</p></reply>

Given this uncertainty, and the ongoing instability in the EU neighbourhood, it is important, now more than ever, for the EU to present a shared vision of its future.  The newly published EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy aims to do just that.</p>  <p>  The Strategy sets out a vision for the EU's foreign and security policy and commits the EU to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law.  It stresses the importance of promoting and protecting human rights, development cooperation, conflict resolution and global governance to address the root causes of the challenges, such as migration and extremism, currently facing the European Union.  Strengthening the EU's peace-keeping capacity in support of the United Nations is an integral part of this effort.  This will be done through the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy as defined in the EU Treaties.  The Strategy also has a positive focus on the Middle East Peace Process, disarmament, gender, the UN and importance of multilateralism more generally.  The Strategy concludes that our security is best safeguarded by enhancing the current comprehensive approach, using the EU's political, diplomatic, trade, development cooperation and peacekeeping instruments in a coherent way.</p>  <p>  At the most recent Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Monday, Ministers exchanged views on the implementation of the Strategy.  I stressed the need to take forward work on each of the elements of the Strategy &ndash; including our approach to resolving conflicts and crises &ndash; in an integrated way.  I also welcomed the commitment in the Strategy to continue to mainstream human rights; women, peace and security, and gender equality in EU policies.  These two important elements were reflected in the Conclusions adopted by EU Foreign Ministers. </p>  <p>  As part of the Irish Government's response to the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, I have spoken individually to each of my 27 EU counterparts which I am following up with a series of bilateral meetings.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, I met with the Luxembourg Foreign Minister, Jean Asselborn, in Luxembourg on Sunday prior to the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  I have also met with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and have engaged in depth on this issue with the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.</p>  <p>  Last Wednesday, I met with Michel Barnier, the European Commission's Chief Negotiator in charge of leading the Commission Taskforce for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations with the United Kingdom under Article 50.  I also met with Secretary of State David Davis when he visited on 8 September.</p>  <p>  Beyond the UK and the EU, I represented the government at the Asia-Europe summit in Mongolia and spoke with many of my counterparts there.  Similar contacts took place during my visit to New York in mid-September for a United Nations programme, during which I engaged in further bilateral meetings and also gave a keynote speech at Fordham University, with a focus on Brexit, Ireland and Europe.  I also did a series of interviews with the US media when in New York for the UN.</p>  <p>  As chair of the government's Export Trade Council, I and my Department are also centrally involved in efforts across the world to support Irish trade and investment in the context of the challenges of Brexit.  The Export Trade Council met most recently on Tuesday 18 October.</p></reply>

In this House, I welcomed the news of a ceasefire last April, and I was very disappointed to learn of its breakdown in August.</p>  <p>  However, there have been some signs of hope over the last few days, with parties agreeing to temporarily lay down arms as they consider returning to the negotiating table.  I commend the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, and his team for their tireless efforts to date in promoting a political solution to the Yemeni conflict, and I hope that this latest effort is successful.</p>  <p>  The humanitarian situation in Yemen is &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;, according to the UN.  Before the war ever broke out, Yemen was the poorest country in the Gulf.  Now, eighty percent of the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance.  The country is on the brink of famine.  I appeal to all parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian aid access as a matter of priority.  The most effective way to end the people's suffering is to end the war, but, in the interim, aid workers must be given access so that they can provide life-saving supplies and help to civilians.</p>  <p>  For our part, since the onset of the current conflict in 2015, the Government has disbursed &euro;3,950,000 in humanitarian aid to Yemen.  </p>  <p>  Air strikes on civilians and civilian infrastructure have become a very disturbing feature of this conflict.  Reports abound of such attacks being perpetrated by both sides.  I cannot comment on the intent of these air strikes, but it is clear that innocent people continue to be injured and killed in such attacks.  I was particularly concerned to learn of the strike on a funeral in Sana'a recently, in which killed over 140 people were killed.  Such attacks are unacceptable. </p>  <p>  I unreservedly condemn all deliberate targeting of civilians.  I urge all parties to this conflict to respect International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, as I have done before in this House, and as I did with my EU partners last year at the Foreign Affairs Council, when we passed Council Conclusions on the conflict in Yemen.  </p>  <p>  Whether or not the attacks in Yemen constitute war crimes is, however, a matter for investigation, and decision by the courts.  Ireland has been a strong advocate, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, for an independent, international investigation into potential abuses of International Humanitarian Law in Yemen.</p></reply>

A further airlift of non-food emergency supplies is being planned.</p>  <p>  The coordinated international response to Hurricane Matthew has been led by the Government of Haiti, and supported by the UN and the EU.  The immediacy of the response was affected by difficult access to the regions most affected and a delay in carrying out needs assessments.  The UN issued a Flash Appeal a number of days after the Hurricane seeking $119 million for the provision of life-saving assistance to 750,000 people over the coming three months.  The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund has released $5 million to address urgent needs.  Ireland last year provided a total of &euro;11.75 million to the Central Emergency Relief Fund, and is its eighth highest international donor.</p>  <p>  The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was also activated in response to a request from the Government of Haiti.

There was a similar increase in the very much smaller amount of goods allowed to be exported from Gaza.  These increases are of course welcome, but they are too little, and the total remains far below the level before the restrictions were imposed in 2007.</p>  <p>  These restrictions continue to impact on the daily needs of the population, to slow the essential reconstruction of houses and other structures following the 2014 conflict, and are completely inadequate to allow anything like normal economic activity in the Strip, without which of course the population remains almost entirely dependent on humanitarian aid.</p>  <p>  Clearly, Israel has real and legitimate security concerns about attacks into its territory from Gaza, but we have made clear that a response of blanket restrictions on the entire population is not only unjustified but counterproductive.</p>  <p>  I have seen recent reports that, while deliveries of reconstruction materials had significantly improved in the first half of this year, recent weeks have seen a slowdown in approvals for reconstruction projects and in deliveries.  It is not yet clear if this is a change of policy or a temporary hiatus, as has happened before.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently sought to ensure that the issue of Gaza remains on the international agenda, notwithstanding other crises in the region.  I raised the issue myself with Prime Minister Netanyahu when I met him in June.  We will continue to do so.  Both the EU and the relevant UN agencies are fully engaged on the issue, and a slackening in deliveries of construction materials would be a very negative development, and a matter of serious concern.</p></reply>

The CTA is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries.  It operates across a range of areas including allowing for free movement between Ireland and the UK, voting rights and access to social welfare.</p>  <p>  The eventual departure of the UK from the EU means that the only land border between the EU and the UK will be on the island of Ireland.  It will be geographically isolated from the rest of the EU and, as it will be outside the Schengen arrangements, the integrity of the border controls of the Schengen area will not be affected in any way.  Furthermore it will be part of a pre-existing British-Irish arrangement that has long been recognised, the CTA.  However, the CTA has only ever operated where both Ireland and the UK were either outside of the EU, or within it.</p>  <p>  The CTA is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and both Governments will work hard to preserve its benefits.  It will be a key issue for Ireland in the context of negotiating new terms and conditions for the EU's relationship with the UK.  We will prioritise this matter in the context of a new relationship between the EU and the UK, and in bilateral discussions with the British Government.  So whilst it cannot be stated with certainty at this stage that no immigration controls at borders will be introduced, we would hope that arrangements can remain as close to the current regime as is possible.</p>  <p>  Regarding trade, we are all acutely conscious of the importance of the UK market to Irish exporters and every effort is being made to protect existing trade and to continue to grow it. </p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Trade, I am also intensifying our efforts on other markets, near and far.  I believe we have the capacity for much greater market penetration in other EU member states and I am focused on that.  But we are also looking beyond Europe's borders.  Indeed, at a meeting of the Export Trade Council last week there was a strong focus on markets in Asia in particular.  In September I attended the UN General Assembly where I had a series of bilateral meetings with countries from the Americas, Asia and the Antipodes.  I gave the strong message that Ireland will remain at the heart of Europe; we will continue to be an English speaking gateway to a market of 500 million people; and we will continue to offer a business friendly environment and a talented and adaptable workforce.</p></reply>

Partners are selected on the basis of their contribution to the Department's priority outcomes, the quality of results achieved and their capacity to use funds effectively.</p>  <p>  Since 2003, Irish Aid has worked in partnership with the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative on the fight against HIV and AIDS.  This work, which we implement in partnership with the Ministries of Health in Mozambique and Lesotho, has been successful in improving the prevention of HIV transmission, including mother-to-child transmission, and increasing the number of people receiving HIV treatment.  In Mozambique for example, 550,000 people are now receiving HIV treatment, up from 3,000 people in 2003.  In Lesotho, the partnership has led to improvement in maternal and child health, through equipping health centres, training and better use of routine vaccines.</p>  <p>  We have provided a total of &euro;2.776 million directly to the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative in the period from 2008 to 2016.  This funding has financed the provision of technical support to the Ministries of Health in Mozambique and Lesotho.  Both the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative are recognised for their technical expertise in drug procurement, the roll-out of health technologies and nutrition. In addition they are also highly respected for their ability to leverage additional funding and negotiate the lowest prices for drugs and other essential commodities, which would otherwise not be available to the Ministries of Health.</p></reply>

The intended focus of the discussion was on the broad set of issues that define the relationship.  However, given the timing of the discussion, it was inevitable that Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine dominated the exchanges.</p>  <p>  On Ukraine, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande briefed the Council on the outcome of their Normandy format meeting with President Putin and President Poroshenko the previous evening in Berlin.  The summit meeting came at a time of growing concern over the fragile security situation in eastern Ukraine and slow progress on implementation of the Minsk peace agreements.</p>  <p>  The Foreign Ministers of the four countries were tasked with developing a roadmap before the end of November which will address all aspects of the Minsk accords, including security, humanitarian and political issues, as well as the holding of elections in eastern Ukraine, under the supervision of the OSCE. </p>  <p>  EU leaders expressed support for this latest initiative aimed at breaking the current deadlock.  They also called for the rapid implementation of the disengagement plan along the contact line as a means to secure the shaky ceasefire and reiterated that the Minsk agreements remain the framework for resolving the conflict. </p>  <p>  The current sanctions which the EU imposed against Russia for its actions in Ukraine run until 31 January 2017.  It is expected that EU leaders will consider extending the duration of these measures at their December meeting.  As with previous rollovers, developments on the ground in eastern Ukraine will be the key factor in determining what decision is taken.   </p>  <p>  On Syria, the European Council strongly condemned the ongoing aerial attacks on Aleppo by the Syrian regime and Russia and urged both states to bring an immediate end to the atrocities being committed.  They repeated calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and stressed that all necessary steps be taken to ensure humanitarian access to Syria. </p>  <p>  The need to ensure that those who have committed atrocities and breached humanitarian law are held to account was also highlighted. </p>  <p>  The question of sanctions in response to Russian and Syrian actions in Aleppo was also discussed.  It was agreed that the EU would consider all available options should the atrocities against the people of Aleppo continue.</p></reply>

At present, it is Ireland's largest response to any humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid funding, managed by my Department, seeks to meet the needs of those inside Syria, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have fled to neighbouring countries.  Funding is channelled through NGO partners, UN organisations and the International Red Cross movement, which are best placed to respond is used to provide humanitarian supplies and urgently-needed health, education, water and sanitation services, and with a particular focus on the protection of children, women and the most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU's humanitarian response in Syria, including the new Humanitarian Initiative for Aleppo, launched in rapid response to the escalation of the conflict and its impact on civilians.  This joint EU-UN initiative aims to facilitate the urgent delivery of basic life-saving assistance to civilians and to ensure the medical evacuations of wounded and sick, with a focus on women, children and the elderly. </p>  <p>  Given its complexity and severity, I expect that Ireland will provide additional support for people affected by the crisis in the coming months. </p>  <p>  In relation to the possible relocation of Syrian refugees to Ireland, primary policy responsibility lies with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

However, the EU set out a clear position in the Council conclusions adopted by Foreign Ministers in November 2015, reiterating the EU's support for a political solution to the crisis based on UN Security Council Resolution 2216, and calling for an immediate end to fighting and the establishment of an inclusive political process.</p></reply>

Mr Barnier's visit to Dublin was one of a series of engagements with EU capitals, in order to prepare for the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. Our discussions were timely, especially given the indication by Prime Minister May in early October - and confirmed to EU leaders at last week's European Council -  that she will trigger Article 50 no later than March next year. </p><p>During his visit, Mr Barnier also met with the T&aacute;naiste; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Minister for European Affairs, as well as senior officials. </p><p>Mr Barnier, who took office as Head of the European Commission's Brexit Taskforce on 1 October, will lead the EU's technical negotiations with the UK. This process will proceed under the political guidance of EU Heads of State or Government at the European Council, and subject to their approval, once the UK Government has formally triggered Article 50. </p><p>My exchange with Mr Barnier was open and constructive. He is well-known to us in Ireland, given his various roles at national and at EU levels. Consequently he understands our close historical, political and economic ties with the UK. </p><p>  During our discussions, I took the opportunity to emphasise and explain in some detail Ireland's unique set of concerns arising from Brexit, in relation to Northern Ireland, the peace process, and citizenship issues; the Common Travel Area and border issues; and the depth of our economic and trade relationship with the UK. We also spoke about Ireland's strong support for EU membership and our commitment to play a full part in the negotiations process. In this context, I briefed Mr Barnier about the various strands of work which are advancing here at political and official levels to prepare Ireland to the maximum extent possible for the period ahead. </p><p>  Given the critical role of Mr Barnier and the Commission, it was also useful to hear his thoughts about the process and how negotiations might be handled in the next, critical phase. </p><p>I assured Mr Barnier that we look forward to working closely with the Commission team in the months ahead and we agreed to stay in close contact.</p></reply>

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department's website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland's ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced its second stage reading in the D&aacute;il on 5 October.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.   </p>  <p>  Work is also underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification. It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health. The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.  I expect to publish the Bill shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention by end-2016.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-25a.151.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102500059#WRC03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 to 86, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Commissioner of Valuation, who is independent in the exercise of his functions, has overall responsibility under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 for the maintenance of valuation lists of all commercial properties in the State. This is done by using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;. Firstly, revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. After the first revaluation of a Local Authority area is completed, revaluation is then scheduled to take place every five to ten years to reflect changes in economic circumstances since the last revaluation took place. Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. </p><p>The national revaluation programme currently underway is the first general revaluation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century. It is a very significant undertaking involving the valuation of some 146,000 commercial rateable properties. Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the five to ten year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the valuation system.</p><p>  All rateable properties in the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick local authority areas are now re-valued. In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been revalued on a global basis. This represents approximately 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  The Commissioner has recently made valuation orders for the revaluation of 10 Local Authorities in respect of some 29,500 commercial properties. The revaluation in two of these County Council areas, Carlow and Kilkenny (5,000 properties approx), is being conducted on a pilot basis using external resources (outsourcing). This approach was provided for in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. </p><p>The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 also provided for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation with the assistance of the occupiers of property using elements of self-assessment. This provision &ndash; known as &ldquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo; - is one of the provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. This approach, though readily used as a means of assessment in personal and corporate taxation codes, has not been used in comparable jurisdictions in relation to the valuation of commercial properties for rating purposes. The Commissioner is in the course of establishing a pilot project in County Laois (2,300 properties approx) using &rdquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo;.  The Valuation Office has conducted the necessary statutory consultations with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with Laois County Council and is developing appropriate technical and statutory systems of valuation which will underpin the pilot project and allow for its initiation in 2017. </p><p>While the revaluation programme has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and, during 2015, some 5,438 applications for revision were processed. Also, any backlog of revision work is cleared during the revaluation of a local authority area. As already mentioned, revision of valuation is the process by which the valuation lists are maintained between revaluations and reflects changes to property of a structural nature and the addition to the valuation lists of new properties. The number of outstanding applications for revision of valuation received by the Valuation Office on a yearly basis is indicated on Table 1 hereunder. Table 2 shows the current age profile of these applications.  The provision of information regarding the square footage of these properties is not possible at this time as this information is obtained during the revision process. </p><p>It has been a priority for the Valuation Office to enter into collaborative arrangements to ensure that an efficient and effective revision programme can be conducted on an ongoing basis with all Local Authorities. The Commissioner has implemented a number of initiatives to enhance the capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver a high-quality and timely revision service. During 2015, the Office carried out a revision pilot project involving four local authorities which was designed to improve data exchange with local authorities in general.  Following the conclusion of the pilot project, this approach is being rolled out to all local authorities and online services have been enhanced to facilitate more effective data exchanges between those bodies and the Valuation Office.  </p><p>I am advised by the Valuation Office that the current number of valuer staff engaged on valuation work is 71. The Valuation Office recently commissioned a review of its revaluation and revision processes which was jointly conducted by the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation (IRRV) and the International Property Tax Institute (IPTI). That review made a number of recommendations in line with best international practice and which are based on methodologies and processes for handling statutory valuation work in other jurisdictions. These recommendations will now form the basis of an implementation plan which is being put in place by the Valuation Office. The review also proposed, among other recommendations, the establishment of a separate, permanently resourced, Revision Unit which would be responsible for the processing of revision work and the ongoing assessment of properties falling under this category.  In this regard, following the receipt of a business case from the Valuation Office seeking the provision of additional funding to allow for the establishment of such a dedicated Revision Unit, I was pleased to be in a position to announce as part of the recent budgetary provisions, the allocation of an additional &euro;750,000 for this purpose.  This development, which will involve the appointment of a number of additional staff, in tandem with the rollout of improved online facilities and enhanced processes and procedures, is specifically intended to address backlogs in conducting revision assessments and to enable the Valuation Office to provide timely and high quality revision services to Local Authorities and ratepayers into the future. </p><p>The Deputy has requested information in relation to the potential loss to each local authority affected by delays in assessing properties for rates. The collection of rates is solely a matter for local authorities and the financial implications of the revision programme is a matter for individual local authorities. The amount would ultimately be dependent on each authority's Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) and its overall income and expenditure decided on at its annual budget meeting.  The Commissioner has no mandate or part to play in these arrangements.</p><p><b>Table 1 - Revision Applications Outstanding by Year Received</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Prior to and

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-25a.157.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102500059#WRC03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 101, 105 and 121 together.</p>  <p>  The levels of service to be provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are set out each year in the annual policing plan.  The independent Policing Authority is required under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (the Act), as amended, to determine priorities and targets for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in performing its functions relating to policing services. In developing the policing priorities for 2017 the Authority has had regard to the programme for Government, the Strategy Statement for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na 2016-2018, the Garda public attitudes survey, consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, concerns expressed by members of the public and civil society and in the media, and priorities for previous and comparator policing plans. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner published An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on 9 June 2016. The Programme is the Commissioner's response to the recognised demand for reform from both inside and outside the Garda organisation. Its implementation will result in a restructured organisation to ensure it can meet present and future policing and security challenges.  It is anticipated that implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme will feature amongst the policing priorities for 2017 and will address the issues around garda deployment which the Deputy raises in her question. </p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on the process for developing the annual policing plan I can advise that this is clearly set out in Section 22 of the Act. When producing her policing plan, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the priorities determined by the Policing Authority. The Authority shall then, with my consent, approve the plan and send a copy to me to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is expected the Policing Plan for 2017 will be received by my Department in early December for my consent.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Garda Inspectorate is commencing a review to examine the dispersement and use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and to make recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service. This review will consider demographic changes and is being overseen by the Policing Authority.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel and vehicles, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts. I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the significant resources that have been made available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 which will help facilitate the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme.  In particular, some &euro;205 million for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  The Government has approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has as its centrepiece a vision of a police service comprising 15,000 garda&iacute;, 4,000 civilians and 2,000 reserves.</p></reply>

In accordance with Rule 62 (4) where a direction is still in force, the Governor shall review the situation not less than every seven days from the issuing of the initial directive.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of resources is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy is covered by Coolock Garda District which is part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the current Garda strength in that Division was 675, of which 102 were assigned to Coolock Garda station.  The station also has a complement of 6 Garda Reserves and 11 Civilian staff.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation), and the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of which 41 have been assigned to the DMR North.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner. The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>I am, of course, conscious of the impact which anti-social behaviour and the types of crime referred to have on the quality of life for residents in local communities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have a role in relation to Garda policing strategies in any particular local area but have brought the Deputy's specific concerns to the attention of the Garda Authorities.</p><p>  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p></reply>

The letter of notification set out the reasons for the recommendation made by the member of the IRM panel who examined the papers.  I accepted that recommendation, as I have done in all of the cases referred to the IRM.  The recommendation in this case was that I should take no further action.</p>  <p>  It is assumed that the report referred to by the Deputies is a report prepared by a Superintendent in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in early 2007.  That  report was neither requested by, nor done by, my Department.  Nor was it commissioned by a former Minister of the Department.  The report in question was prepared on the instructions of the then Garda Commissioner after the individual concerned wrote to the Commissioner in October 2006 raising matters in relation to the original investigation.  The then Garda Commissioner ordered a full assessment of the investigation and the issues raised by the individual concerned. </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the report follows an internal Garda review related to the case.  The individual concerned has previously requested a copy of the report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they took the decision to refuse to provide a copy.</p>  <p>  My Department has requested, and was provided with, various Garda reports on a number of occasions related to this case.  The intention on each occasion was to seek material to assist in drafting a response to correspondence submitted by the person concerned to the then Minister.  This approach is regularly taken by the Department when dealing with such representations. </p>  <p>  However, in relation to the particular report referred to in the Deputies' questions neither the Department nor I were provided with a copy of the Superintendent's report, nor was any request made for the report, until the case was included for consideration under the IRM.  At the request of counsel, my Department wrote to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeking access to the report on behalf of the IRM panel to assist counsel in their consideration of the case.  In response to that request, a copy of the report was provided to my Department by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in January 2016.  The report was forwarded by the Department to the Panel and they concluded their consideration of the complaint. </p>  <p>  My Department has written to the individual concerned explaining the position in relation to the report on a number of occasions.</p></reply>

These parents and guardians have the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of their children who reside with them and in that respect the safety of all residents &ndash; especially children &ndash; is at the forefront of the Reception and Integration Agency's (RIA's) operations.  RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children and is fully compliant with all relevant legislative requirements.  The staffing allocation of the Child and Family Services Unit in RIA includes a suitably qualified secondment post from Tusla and the role of the unit is to plan, manage, deliver, coordinate and monitor all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system, including of course child protection services which are covered by RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy.</p><p>This policy is based on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' &ldquo;Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children&rdquo;.  This guidance document was developed to assist people in identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns.  The protection and welfare policy emphasises that the needs of children and families must be central to child care, child protection and welfare.  RIA's policy was reviewed and updated in 2014 and now contains a practice document to make it more user friendly.  This document is published on RIA's website <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i></p><p>The role of the officer from TUSLA includes visits to all accommodation centres on a regular basis to meet with parents and centre managers and staff and to oversee the implementation of the Child Protection and Welfare Policy.</p><p>Each accommodation centre has a designated Child Protection Liaison Person who has undertaken Children First &ndash; Keeping Safe Training.  When a child protection or welfare incident arises in a RIA centre it is the function of that Liaison Person to contact the local Social Work Team to inform it of his or her concern and to liaise with the RIA Child and Family Services Unit.  It is important to note that child welfare services are mainstreamed for children in direct provision and are provided on the same basis as for children living elsewhere in the community.</p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy complements other child related policies and procedures in place, viz:</p><p>- Garda Vetting Policy - all staff in centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.</p><p>- RIA Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding RIA residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment. </p><p>- RIA Code of Practice for Persons Working in Accommodation Centres and RIA Staff.  </p><p>- Policy on Accommodation of Aged Out Minors in RIA Accommodation Centres.</p></reply>

I am further advised that the strength of the Garda Fleet, as at 21 October, is as follows:<table><tr><th>Cars</th><th>Vans</th><th>M'Cycles</th><th>4x4</th><th>Other</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2,013</td><td>461</td><td>142</td><td>130</td><td>83</td><td>2,829</td></tr></table></p><p>I understand that Garda vehicles are retired for a variety of reasons including, for example, where they are considered beyond economic repair as a result of accidents and on safety grounds or in line with manufacturers' recommendations.  Generally speaking, vehicles are retired when they reach 300,000 kilometres or 10 years of age, whichever is earlier.  Also, I understand from the Garda authorities that the relevant manufacturers have indicated that, for safety reasons, vehicles should be withdrawn from service at certain stages.  Accordingly, this is the operational policy that is applied by the Garda authorities.  To date in 2016, 279 Garda vehicles have been retired.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that these retirements are a natural occurrence in maintaining any vehicle fleet, and are offset by the significant investment of some &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021, of which the Deputy will be aware.  This investment will continue to provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>Indeed, since the beginning of the year, some 520 new vehicles have come on stream for use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>This investment is also reflected in the current age profile of the Fleet.  For example, some 38% of the fleet is under 2 years old compared to some 5% in 2012.  Some 24% is between 2 and 4 years old compared to some 6% in 2012.  The Deputy will appreciate this is a noticeable difference to the age profile in 2012 where almost 90% of the Fleet was over 4 or more years of age compared to some 38% today.</p></reply>

This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-Vetting system.</p>  <p>  In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-Vetting system.  E-Vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that the vast majority of vetting applications, over 85 percent of applications, now received by the Vetting Bureau are received and processed via the e-Vetting system.</p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on-line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p>  <p>  There are a small number of registered organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system and continue to use the old paper format for applications.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum time frame given the administrative input required.  The Garda Authorities continue to work with the organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system to encourage and support them to do so.</p>  <p>  Processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.</p></reply>

It is therefore expected that this application will be decided in March, 2017.  This time-frame is purely a business target and is subject to the receipt of all required documentation as set out in the Policy Document.  While the Visa Office endeavours to have applications of this nature processed earlier than this target, this is not always possible.

The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>  <p>  In addition, applicants may themselves e-mail queries directly to the Visa Office (visamail@justice.ie).</p></reply>

In this context, I can advise the Deputy that, in consultation with the Garda authorities, I intend to review the operation of the new rebate scheme and our general approach to supporting community crime prevention, including with respect to signage, in the early part of 2017.</p></reply>

As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The review  concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation's resource base would best meet public demand.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that these closures allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to asking the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, amongst other things, both the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersement of Garda stations in rural areas.  In addition, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. I have asked the Authority to initiate the proposed review.  In relation to the proposed pilot scheme, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify for reopening 6 stations that were closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme.</p>  <p>  In relation to funding for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  I secured &euro;1.583 billion for the Garda Vote for 2017.  As I announced on Budget day the Government has approved my proposal that by 2021 the Garda workforce should comprise a total of 21,000 personnel; to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has been provided for the recruitment in 2017 of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Taking into account the recruits currently in training in Templemore, it is expected that there will be 700 new Gardai attested during 2017. This is in addition to the 680 Gardai which will be attested by the end of 2016 arising from the recommencement of recruitment in September 2014. In all, a total of 1,200 trainees will have commenced training in the Garda College over this period. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300 in 2017. The civilians recruited during 2017 will provide specialist, technical, professional and administrative expertise across a range of areas.  The funding provided in the Budget and other important announcements in relation to the significant increase in all components of the Garda workforce builds on the significant infrastructural funding provided in the current Capital Plan. </p>  <p>  This ensures that all the structural components and corresponding funding are now in place to underpin the Commissioner's Modernisation and Reform Plan in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the next  including personnel, critical ICT (with over &euro;205 million allocated for new investment), transport with &euro;46 million over the period, and the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme including 3 new Divisional Headquarters. </p></reply>

This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff. The Garda Inspectorate, in its 2015 report  "Changing Policing in Ireland"  has estimated that there may be up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government's plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years. With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested   to identify posts suitable for redeployment by the end of the year and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in Budget 2017 will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level. These appointments will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years. </p>  <p>  In addition, and again flowing from the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate, the Commissioner has commenced the roll-out on a pilot basis of a Divisional model of policing to replace the   current District model. The benefit of the Divisional model is that responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis which will facilitate greater flexibility in the deployment of resources in response to policing needs. It also will have the benefit of reducing duplicate administrative tasks currently done at both the District and Divisional level. In this regard the Commissioner has estimated that 10 Garda&iacute; will be freed up for front-line duties in each Division once the model is fully rolled out. The roll-out will be done on a phased basis and in such a manner as to ensure that the close relationship between Garda&iacute; and local communities is maintained. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Commissioner is responsible for the recruitment and distribution of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no direct role in these matters. Garda management keeps such matters under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p></reply>

As such, the reports include details of, inter alia, the number of incidents and individual children and young people referred to the Diversion Programme and the outcomes of such referrals, including a geographical breakdown by Garda region and division. </p><p>  In its 2014 Report the Committee reported that 9,991 children and young people were referred to the Diversion Programme. This compares with 10,420 children and young people referred in 2013 and continues the downward trend in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years. I understand that the Monitoring Committee's 2015 report is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>  The Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and is under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme, through the network of  Juvenile Liaison Officers, is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the young offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting children and young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to them and their families.  This is evident from the continuing fall in the number of children and young people being referred to the Programme in recent years. </p><p>  In support of the operation of the Diversion Programme, my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) funds and oversees the operation of the national network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country. The national network comprises over 100 projects, six of which incorporate Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) projects. As the Deputy may know, GYDPs are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour. </p><p>  My Department, again through the Irish Youth Justice Service, also supports the work of the Probation Service through a network of community based Young Persons Probation Projects (YPPs).  There are currently 18 YPPs developing  and delivering services to young offenders in their communities. The management and monitoring of the YPP projects is undertaken directly by the Probation Service. These projects offer services to offenders who would otherwise not be in a position to avail of a mainstream service opportunity, thereby enhancing the work of the Probation Service in changing offending behaviour.</p><p>  Just under &euro;17 million has been allocated in 2016 to support the operation of all of these community based projects. In addition, some &euro;2.8 million additional funding has been made available in 2016 under the Dormant Accounts Scheme to further support the operation of  these community based youth crime prevention projects.  The ongoing investment by my Department in these projects is playing a significant part in the continuing fall in the number of children and young people involved in offending and anti-social behaviour in recent years.</p></reply>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined the organisation on, or after, 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension once they have served at least 30 years and have reached 55 years of age. Accordingly, a member has the option of continuing to serve until they reach 60 years of age.</p><p>The following tables provide details of those members who retired during the years 2011 to 2016, broken down by (a) rank and (b) category.  The tables do not include location as this information is not readily available.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 150 will attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Com</th><th>D/Com</th><th>A/Com</th><th>C/Supt</th><th>Supt</th><th>Insp</th><th>Sgt</th><th>Gda</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>13</td><td>56</td><td>116</td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>78</td><td>131</td><td>238</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>80</td><td>141</td><td>249</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>13</td><td>85</td><td>179</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>19</td><td>24</td><td>115</td><td>260</td><td>424</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>22</td><td>19</td><td>106</td><td>280</td><td>438</td></tr></table>*as of 20.10.16<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Voluntary</th><th>Compulsory</th><th>Early retirement </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>*2016 </td><td>180</td><td>15</td><td>1</td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>222</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>238</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>236</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>249</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>279</td><td>11</td><td>7</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>417</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>424</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>428</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>438</td></tr></table>*as of 20.10.16</p></reply>

The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for protection applications.  Under the single procedure, an applicant will make only one application, and will have all grounds for seeking international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process.  The single procedure will replace the current multi-layered and sequential protection application system, and this reform is designed to significantly simplify and streamline existing arrangements and allow us to grant international protection in a significantly shorter timeframe to those who are entitled to it while identifying, at a much earlier stage, persons who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.  All preparations are currently being made by my Department for the commencement of the Act. </p>  <p>  Under the new legislation, a dedicated unit of my Department, to be known as the 'International Protection Office' will be the determining authority at first instance for applications for international protection, replacing the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC).  The case workers making decisions under the new structure are specialists in the processing of protection cases and trained to UNCHR standards.</p>  <p>  The existing Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) will be replaced by a newly constituted and independent appeals body to be known as the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.  The newly configured and resourced Tribunal is designed to lead to the more efficient conduct of its business and greater consistency in its appeals decisions.</p>  <p>  The transitional provisions in the Act set out how protection applications which are pending in the existing system on the commencement date will be dealt with.  In order to achieve a smooth transition from the existing system to the single applications procedure, additional resources are being deployed to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), ORAC and RAT to assist with the implementation of the Act, including the tackling of existing caseloads both prior and subsequent to the commencement of the Act.  In this regard significant efforts have been placed on dealing with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process, including those in Direct Provision. </p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of members is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that on the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available there were 307 Garda&iacute;, 23 Garda Reserves and 26 civilians assigned to the Kildare Garda Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation), and the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Since the Garda College reopened in 2014 there will have been 1,200 trainee Garda recruited by the end of this year.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and so far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of which 25 have been assigned to the Kildare Garda Division.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. </p>  <p>  In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on last September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched November 2015) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme, the Government is committed to asking the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, amongst other things, both the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersal of Garda stations in rural areas.  In addition, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order and I have asked the Authority to initiate the proposed review.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proposed pilot scheme, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify for reopening 6 stations that were closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme.</p></reply>

The Report contains a total of 173 recommendations, many of which have implications for a number of Government Departments and services.  In the most recent review of progress published in June, 91 recommendations were found to have been implemented; a further 49 recommendations were found to have been partially implemented or<b></b>were in progress; and the balance remained under consideration.  This represents significant progress in taking forward the Working Group recommendations, with 80% now implemented, partially implemented or in progress.  I have committed to advancing the remaining 20%, taking into account the necessary resources that some of these will require.  It should also be noted that a small number of the recommendations have been superseded by Government initiatives in the interim since the publication of the Report.  The most recent status update is available on my Department's website and on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</p><p>A key recommendation of the Working Group was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act.  The Act responds to some 26 of the Working Group's recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and in the Direct Provision system; another key concern of the Working Group.</p><p>In addition, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process, including those in Direct Provision. </p><p>A transition Task Force was also established last year which put in place important supports to facilitate people with status to integrate into the community.  The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months. </p><p>Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in Ireland while their application is being processed is also being made.  In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste and I announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago.  Prescription fees for Direct Provision residents, including children, have also been waived.  I have also committed to extending the remit of the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include access for residents in Direct Provision centres.  This requires amending legislation which will be processed as soon as possible.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017. </p><p>My officials have been in consultation with relevant Government Departments and agencies to update progress on the Working Group recommendations since June with a view to completion by year end.</p></reply>

Where the injured person was under a disability at the time of the injury or of the date of knowledge, the three-year period does not start to run until the person is no longer under a disability.</p>  <p>  However, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 2000 made important changes to the Statute of Limitations 1957 as it relates to acts of sexual abuse done to a person while a child.  As a result of 2000 Act, a victim of child sex abuse is regarded as under a disability if, as a result of that abuse or any other act of the abuser, the person is suffering a psychological injury which substantially impairs his or her ability to make a reasoned decision in relation to bringing the civil action. Thus the three-year period does not start to run in such cases until the victim has recovered sufficiently from the psychological injury to be able to decide whether to bring the action.</p>  <p>  These changes were intended to strike an appropriate balance between the right of the victim of child sex abuse to seek redress from the perpetrator once he or she has overcome the trauma of that abuse sufficiently to be able to commence proceedings, on the one hand, and the rights of people generally to be protected against stale claims, on the other. The courts hearing such a claim are best placed to judge how the change made in the 2000 Act applies in the particular case and it is open to the parties to adduce evidence of whatever criminal proceedings may be relevant to the civil proceedings.</p>  <p>  While I hope this information will be of some assistance to the Deputy, it would be very much advised that any person seeking redress as a victim of child sex abuse under the provisions of the 2000 Act have the benefit of independent legal advice as appropriate to the specific circumstances of his or her case.</p></reply>

According to the Policy Document, a De Facto relationship is a cohabiting relationship akin to marriage duly attested.  As marriage is a legally binding contract and De Facto partnerships are by their nature non-binding, there must be more requirements and considerations in place when assessing applications for De Facto partnerships.</p>  <p>  The De Facto partnership scheme is an administrative scheme whereby an applicant who is currently resident in the State under another permission may apply for permission to remain on the basis of their relationship alone.  Residency in the State based on being the partner of an Irish citizen is generally granted on a case by case basis, accompanied by a submission of documentary evidence that the relationship has been of at least two years duration.  An applicant must be able to provide dated documentary evidence showing that they and their Irish partner have been cohabiting together in a relationship akin to marriage for at least a two year period immediately prior to the application being submitted.  Applicants should be in a position to provide joint tenancy agreements, joint utility bills, bank statements, evidence of joint purchases and finances, documentation showing the noting of each other on your respective insurance documentation and any other documentation a couple would expect to accrue in a marriage type situation.  Applications where a couple are reliant on parents both physically and/or financially for accommodation and/or other resources would not be deemed to be in a relationship akin to marriage or financially independent.  The onus ultimately rests with the applicants to provide sufficient documentary evidence to show that they qualify under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Where a negative decision has been issued, it is open to the applicant to submit a request for a review of this decision. However, it should also be noted that there are other options available to persons who wish to remain in the State for an extended period, for example, Student Conditions, Work Permit etc.</p></reply>

This Part, comprising sections 7 to 36, deals with the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its membership, appointment, functions, staffing and other matters including disqualification or removal from membership.  The Authority comprises eleven members of whom a majority, including the Chairperson, are to be lay persons. </p><p>The selection process is intentionally built around a framework of ten prescribed nominating bodies set out in section 9 of the 2015 Act.  This framework was introduced by the Government by way of ensuring the independence of the new Regulatory Authority in terms of both its appointment and its functions.  It also seeks to represent a balance of interests, in the membership of the Authority, between legal practitioners and those clients who avail of their services.</p><p>The ten bodies concerned are, the Citizens Information Board; An t&Uacute;daras um Ard-Oideachas; the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants; the Consumers Association of Ireland; The Bar Council; the Legal Aid Board; the Honorable Society of the King's Inns and Law Society.  The Law Society has two nominees reflecting the fact that solicitors outnumber barristers being regulated under the 2015 Act by five to one &ndash; upwards of 10,000 practising solicitors as compared to upwards of 2,000 practising barristers.</p><p>Each of the prescribed nominating bodies puts forward one primary and one substitute nominee for consideration for membership of the Regulatory Authority under the terms and criteria set out in the 2015 Act.  This includes by reference to their relevant expertise as set out in section 9(3) and with regard to the objective of there being no fewer than four members who are women and four members who are men under section 9 (6).  This is with the exception of the Law Society which, again because of the ratio of solicitors practising in the State which I have just mentioned, puts forward one nominee of each sex.</p><p>While members of the new Regulatory Authority are duly appointed by the Government under these procedures, under section 9 (2)(a) of the 2015 Act, a resolution approving such appointment has first to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Resolutions of both Houses approving members of the Authority were passed in July 2016 with resolutions concerning one remaining alternative nominee passed by the Houses on 6 October 2016.</p><p>The ten prescribed nominating bodies, therefore, have put forward their nominees under the procedures set out in Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, as appropriate to their functions and objectives as may be set out, in each case, under legislation or under common law.  It is for each of those bodies, in the first instance, to identify their nominees for membership of the new Regulatory Authority under their applicable internal governance procedures.  Specifically, it is for any of these entities which is a private body to competently conduct the indoor management of its board or council and to oversee the conduct of its own business in accordance with its own rules and procedures. </p><p>There has been some correspondence on the nominations aspect with my office to which I have replied directly and my Department has, at its own request, received formal written confirmation from the nominating body concerned that it is satisfied that the internal procedures in respect of its nominations to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority were followed.  Beyond that, and having regard to the other matters raised in the letter conveyed with the Deputy's Question, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on the issues and allegations being raised therein as they concern matters that are, in the first instance, between the parties concerned and may be <i>subjudice</i>.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division as appropriate. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Westmeath Division, on 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 247.  There are also 14 Garda Reserves and 20 Civilians attached to the Westmeath Division. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of which 10 have been assigned to the Westmeath Division.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.</p>  <p>  In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p></reply>

The law in this area was amended most recently by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 which amended the Licensing Acts and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 with the aim of tackling excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor as well public disorder and antisocial behaviour. </p>  <p>  Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licence holder to sell or deliver, or permit another person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years of age.  Moreover, it is an offence for a person to purchase intoxicating liquor for delivery to, or consumption by, a person under the age of 18 years or to deliver intoxicating liquor to such a person, except where the intoxicating liquor is to be consumed in a private residence with the explicit consent of the young person's parent or guardian.</p>  <p>  Under the 1988 Act it is also illegal for a person under 18 years to buy intoxicating liquor or to consume it in any place outside their home (or in another person's home where they are present by right or with permission).  Where a Garda suspects that a person is under 18 years and that person, or anyone accompanying that person, is in possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of consuming it in a place other than a private dwelling, the Garda may seek an explanation and if not satisfied with the reply, he or she may seize the intoxicating liquor if it is not handed over voluntarily. </p>  <p>  The Garda National Age Card scheme is an important proof-of-age mechanism in relation to the sale of intoxicating liquor.  The scheme is administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has facilitated the Garda&iacute;, in cooperation with the licensed trade, to address and combat underage consumption of intoxicating liquor.  The 1988 Act, as amended, also makes provision for the test purchasing of intoxicating liquor.  The primary objective of the scheme is to enable the Garda&iacute; to target licensed premises which are suspected of engaging in illegal sales of intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 years of age. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended) also permits An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seize bottles or containers containing intoxicating liquor where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour arising from the abuse of intoxicating liquor are investigated by the Garda&iacute; and dealt with in an appropriate manner, including by caution, fixed charge penalty notices or commencement of proceedings. </p>  <p>  As regards introduction of a coding system along the lines suggested by the Deputy, implementation of such a measure and its enforcement could be expected to encounter significant difficulties in practice.  Apart from the administrative costs involved in recording purchasers' details at point of sale, practical difficulties would also arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers are packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raises the question of whether a unique code could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  However, this would create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors and in the case of imports from EU countries, any additional labelling requirements would be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such products.</p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, which falls within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Health and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Seanad, contains proposals for restrictions in relation to sponsorship and the advertising of intoxicating liquor and confers powers on the Minister for Health to make regulations for the purpose of prohibiting or restricting the sale of intoxicating liquor in certain circumstances.</p></reply>

In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Principal among these has been the introduction of the British Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS) which enables visitors coming to either country to travel freely between the UK and the Island of Ireland on a single visa.  This has proven hugely beneficial in attracting increasing numbers of tourist and visitors to our shores.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the BIVS, Ireland has partnered with the UK to enable visa applications to be initially lodged at a large number of centres in China and India and to also have biometrics captured at these centres.  The use of these Centres provides greater accessibility to applicants in these countries as they can make visa applications at locations nearer to them.  They also greatly increase the visibility of Ireland as a destination for tourism, business or education purposes across a wider geographical area in very large countries or countries where our consular representation is not physically present.  For example, in India there are a total of twelve Centres established across the country where applications for both Irish and United Kingdom visas can be made and where initial processing of documentation is carried out.  Similar arrangements apply in China where applications for Irish visas can be submitted in one of thirteen Centres (including Hong Kong).</p>  <p>  The applicant can choose the Centre most convenient to their home or business address, and for a small extra charge, can choose to have the visa returned by courier to their home or business address.  There is also a facility for group bookings to facilitate applicants who are travelling together to Ireland. It is intended over time to expand the use of such facilities in order to provide better services to potential travellers to Ireland.</p>  <p>  These facilities are provided to accept visa applications and supporting documents for transfer by courier to an INIS staffed Visa Office or Irish Embassy for processing by Irish civil servants.  The company has no involvement in the decision making process for a visa application which is undertaken only by Irish civil servants of my Department.  Applicants may also collect their visas and documents from the Centre following completion of processing.  I understand that  the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have established similar facilities in other locations referred to by the Deputy and operate on a similar basis.</p></reply>

Applicants from Nepal are advised to submit their applications initially to the Centre in Kathmandu for onward transmission to the Visa Office at the Irish Embassy in New Delhi for decision on the application.</p></reply>

Therefore there is no VAT on the fee charged to the patient by the doctor providing the service regardless of whether the doctor is an employee, self-employed or a partner in a medical practice.</p><p>In general, the tax treatment of payments to doctors or locum doctors depends on whether the individual is engaged under a contract of service as an employee or under a contract for service as a self-employed taxpayer. If the doctor is self-employed in relation to the services provided, then the individual is assessable under Schedule D, Case II under the self-assessment system. If the doctor provides the medical services as an employee, then his or her remuneration from that engagement is subject to deductions at source under the PAYE system. For example, where a doctor is engaged for short-term work in a GP practice, these engagements are considered to be a contract of service. The locum doctor is an employee and payments made to them by the GP are subject to the appropriate deductions under the PAYE system. In neither of these situations, where the doctor is self employed or employed,<b></b>does<b></b>a<b></b>charge to VAT arise.</p><p>However, where the services of a doctor are provided by a company, such as a recruitment agency, the profits of the company are assessable to Corporation Tax. The doctor is taxed under the PAYE system as either a director or an employee in respect of fees or salary received from the company. In these circumstances the company does not provide the medical diagnosis or carry out the medical procedures. Revenue would regard this service as the provision of staff and, as such, is subject to VAT at the standard rate, which is currently 23% in Ireland. The company is also entitled to deduct VAT charged on most goods and services which are for the purposes of a taxable business.</p><p>VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC) with which Irish VAT law must comply. The Directive provides for an exemption from VAT for supplies of certain medical services. In compliance with the Directive, the provisions in Irish VAT legislation apply the VAT exemption to the professional medical care services as recognised by the Department of Health. Those medical care services are generally supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries.</p><p>I cannot comment on the particular details given by the Deputy as there is not enough information to determine for VAT purposes what the supplies being referred to are and if, VAT should apply or not to those services.</p></reply>

This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p>  <p>  Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting and it would be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  Furthermore, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the partial transferability of the standard rate band and tax credits, their legal status as spouses/civil partners has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. To counter tax avoidance, numerous restrictive provisions regarding transactions between "connected persons" are contained in the various Tax Acts and the definition of "connected persons" extends to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. Such provisions could be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.</p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Leo Varadkar TD. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

There will be an initial Application, followed subsequently by a Claim for Rebate. In making the initial Application, it is anticipated that a person who intends to avail of the scheme may not yet have made his or her final decision regarding the particular residence he or she wishes to purchase or the choice of lending institution. In order to facilitate first-time buyers in making those decisions, Revenue will, following receipt of an Application, and subject to the applicant satisfying the terms of the scheme, notify the applicant of the maximum tax rebate that may be available to them. The prospective purchaser will then be able to share this information with a lending institution when negotiating a loan.</p>  <p>  When the purchaser has determined the choice of residence and negotiated their mortgage, they can complete their Claim for Rebate.  At that stage, they will be in a position to provide Revenue with details of the property, the purchase price and the mortgage approval.  A key requirement is that the minimum loan-to-value ratio of 70% must be observed. As part of the Claim for Rebate process, the vendor will be required to confirm to Revenue the details of the contract to enable the payment of the rebate to be made.  In the case of a self-build, the solicitor acting on behalf of the first-time buyer will be required to make the necessary confirmation to Revenue.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the payment process for the tax rebate will vary depending on the circumstances of the first-time purchaser as set out hereunder:</p>  <p>  - In the case of contracts to purchase a newly built residence entered into in the period from 19 July 2016 to 31 December 2016, the tax rebate will be paid directly to the first-time buyer after the Revenue online system comes on stream in January 2017.</p>  <p>  - In all other cases involving contracts for the purchase of a newly built residence, the tax rebate will be paid directly to the vendor and will form part of the deposit required from the purchaser.  This will be treated by the vendor as a credit against the purchase price of the residence.</p>  <p>  - In the case of a self-builds, the tax rebate will available to the first-time buyer after he/she or they draw down the first tranche of the mortgage loan entered into to finance the construction of the residence. Where this occurs in the period from 19 July 2016 to 31 December 2016, the rebate will become available once the Revenue online system comes on stream in January 2017.</p></reply>

In line with my Department's commitment to evidence based policy-making, the inclusion of these additional four cities followed the completion of a comprehensive, independent ex-ante cost benefit analysis.</p>  <p>  I announced a number of changes to the scheme in the Budget which aim to get the design of the Initiative right so that it can be more effective. Once this is achieved and evidenced, it will then be possible to consider how, or if, the Initiative could be extended to other locations. The Deputy will be aware of a further commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government, to examine the introduction of a similar scheme to the "Living City Initiative" to regenerate town centres and villages throughout Ireland.

Free expert financial and legal advice is now available to those having difficulty meeting their mortgage payments. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the gateway for access to such advice and I would urge anyone worried about their mortgage arrears to contact MABS to avail of free, confidential and independent advice.</p><p>In addition, I have written to the Governor of the Central Bank to request that an assessment be undertaken of the range of available sustainable restructure solutions offered by banks and non-bank entities.  The Central Bank expects to complete this assessment in the coming weeks.</p><p>Finally, it is  worth noting that Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions data released by the Central Bank for quarter 2-2016 provided further evidence that progress is being made in addressing mortgage arrears, with the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears continuing to fall for the 12th consecutive quarter.  In addition, over 120,000 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured, of which 88% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their restructure arrangement, the highest level since the series began.  This shows that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.<table><tr><th colspan="7"><b>Repossessions 2011-2016 - Central Bank Data</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Primary Dwelling Homes (PDH) Repossessions</b></td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016 to end Q2</td></tr><tr><td>Properties repossessed on foot of an order  </td><td>196</td><td>194 </td><td>251 </td><td>315 </td><td>726 </td><td>240 </td></tr><tr><td>Properties voluntarily surrendered/abandoned</td><td>412 </td><td>409 </td><td>515 </td><td>996 </td><td>809 </td><td>578 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL </td><td><b>608 </b></td><td><b>603 </b></td><td><b>766 </b></td><td><b>1,311 </b></td><td><b>1,535 </b></td><td><b>818 </b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Buy-to-let (BTL) Repossessions</b></td><td>2011</td><td>*Q3 &amp;amp; Q4 2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016 to end Q2</td></tr><tr><td>Properties repossessed on foot of an order  </td><td></td><td>50 </td><td>100 </td><td>170 </td><td>562 </td><td>312 </td></tr><tr><td>Properties voluntarily surrendered/abandoned</td><td></td><td>112 </td><td>183 </td><td>290 </td><td>279 </td><td>295 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td><b>162 </b></td><td><b>283 </b></td><td><b>460 </b></td><td><b>841 </b></td><td><b>607 </b></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL PDH &amp;amp; BTL </td><td><b>   </b></td><td><b>765 </b></td><td><b>1,049 </b></td><td><b>1,771 </b></td><td><b>2,376 </b></td><td><b>1,425 </b></td></tr></table>*Buy -To- Let Data was only published by the Central Bank from Sept 2012 onwards </p></reply>

For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 the rate was 0.60% of the scheme assets. For the year 2014 the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p>  <p>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.</p>  <p>  In these circumstances there is no question of anything being paid to Revenue as any permanent reduction in benefits paid to members reflects the application of the levy to the fund in question over the period in which the levy applied.</p></reply>

Completed transactions are either announced or reported as part of the Fund's regular transparent fund reporting. The economic impact of all ISIF investments, which includes the Connectivity Fund, is outlined in the Fund's semi-annual, fund level, economic impact reports, which include regional deployment data. As at December 2015, the ISIF economic impact report demonstrated regionally balanced investments with 60% of jobs supported and 46% of capital invested outside of Dublin. The report as at 30 June 2016 is expected to be published in early December.</p>  <p>  The ISIF is actively engaging with state agencies and local authorities, as well as having a close working relationship with several government departments. This is in accordance with ISIF's mandate which requires it to support Government policy, and ISIF engages with each of the relevant entities in respect of Government policy objectives to ensure that its activities are aligned.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Connectivity Fund specifically, ISIF has informed me that it recently announced the completion of its first two investments from this fund.  The combined value of these investments is &euro;57m and they are in the areas of data connectivity and telecoms, and air connectivity.  The air connectivity investment was &euro;35 million in daa plc, which is State owned.</p>  <p>  Several other Connectivity Fund investment opportunities are currently being assessed under the ISIF's "double bottom line" mandate, which is to seek both commercial return and economic impact. These connectivity opportunities include potential investments in energy, air, sea and further data connectivity projects and businesses seeking to expand and enhance Ireland's international links, while also achieving a broad regional spread in accordance with ISIF's broader investment strategy.</p></reply>

There is a broad geographical spread of the SMEs supported with approximately 85% of them based outside Dublin.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety economic sectors and employ over 43,000 people across the country. </p>  <p>  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs and instead lends through partner financial institutions known as on-lenders.  The SBCI has established relationships with 7 on-lending partners to date, and this provides significant geographical and sectoral reach for its products.  The SBCI now supports a broad range of lending products for SMEs including term lending, leasing, contract hire, fleet finance and invoice discounting.  The SBCI is currently in discussions with potential new on-lenders, and it is anticipated that SBCI funding will be available from additional on-lenders in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  The SBCI has access to over &euro;1 billion of low cost funding that it will continue to make available to support Irish SMEs and the significant contribution they make to the Irish economy.</p></reply>

The Programme further provides that it will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.</p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and the preparation of legislation in relation to housing.  </p><p>The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator of credit unions, and ultimately any decision around credit unions providing such funding would require regulatory approval prior to implementation.  The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016.  Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications, including to Regulation 25(2), which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p><p>My Department has received a number of different proposals from the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) and from the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU). Proposals from both representative bodies, in relation to the funding of social housing, are at various stages of development.  Officials from both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have met with these bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.  Officials from both Departments also met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing. </p><p>Ultimately, the funding mechanisms required will have to be put in place in the first instance by credit unions themselves, with the support of its members and with the agreement of the Central Bank, without negatively impacting on the General Government Balance, and keeping the funding 'off-balance sheet'.

The Directive requires that the resources of a scheme must be invested in accordance with the 'prudent person' rule and in particular in accordance with certain investment rules.

The buyers that the Deputy refers to would already have sufficient cash resources to meet those requirements, except in cases where the operation of the loan to income aspect of the macro prudential rules mean that a larger deposit is necessary.  The Deputy may be aware that in general, the latter provides that the total mortgage provided should not be greater than 3.5 times the income of the individual(s).</p>  <p>  The scheme was initially designed to require a minimum loan to value ratio of 80% in order to qualify.  However, the Central Bank of Ireland has indicated to my Department that a sizable number of first time buyers take out a mortgage with a loan to value ratio of less than 80% and that the minimum loan to value ratio set for the scheme could act to encourage such buyers to borrow more than necessary in order to avail of the scheme.  Having considered the issue, I decided to reduce the minimum loan to value ratio to 70% and this change is reflected in the underpinning legislation in Section 8 of the  Finance Bill as published.</p></reply>

The aim of the Incentive is to support tax compliant building contractors by moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy.  The Incentive was introduced in October 2013. It provides for tax relief by way of an income tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure.  Qualifying work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 including VAT at 13.5% rate.  The maximum qualifying cost for the purpose of the incentive is &euro;30,000 including VAT at 13.5%.  This equates to a maximum tax credit of &euro;4,050.  The tax credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is paid for.  I extended this incentive for a further two years, until the end of 2018, in the Budget.</p>  <p>  The Living City Initiative is a scheme of property tax incentives designed to regenerate both historic buildings and other buildings in specified cities.  It was enacted in the Finance Act 2013 and commenced on 5th May 2015.  The scheme applies to certain special regeneration areas (SRAs) in the centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Kilkenny.  In line with my Department's commitment to evidence based policy-making, the inclusion of these additional four cities followed the completion of a comprehensive, independent ex-ante cost benefit analysis.  The relief applies to both residential and commercial refurbishment and conversion work that is carried out during the qualifying period.  There are 2 types of tax relief available under the Living City Initiative - an owner-occupier residential element, and a retail/commercial element. </p>  <p>  I announced a number of changes to the scheme in the Budget which aim to get the design of the Initiative right so that it can be more effective.  Once this has been achieved, it will then be possible to consider how, or if, the Initiative could be extended to other locations.  The Deputy will be aware of a further commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government, to examine the introduction of a similar scheme to the "Living City Initiative" to regenerate town centres and villages throughout Ireland. It is important that the underpinning scheme is made more effective, as until that has been achieved and evidenced, extension of eligibility for it to other towns would be largely meaningless.</p></reply>

Single individuals and married couples/civil partners that are first-time buyers, qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively. In all other cases, the relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively. </p><p>The following table details the rates of tax relief available in respect of qualifying loans. <table><tr><th>- </th><th>Tax Years 1 &amp;amp; 2</th><th>Tax Years 3, 4 &amp;amp; 5 </th><th>Tax Years 6 &amp;amp; 7 *</th></tr><tr><td>First time buyers (First 7 tax years of entitlement to tax relief on interest paid)</td><td>Rate of tax relief = 25%</td><td>Rate of tax relief = 22.5%</td><td>Rate of tax relief = 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Non-first time buyers</td><td>Rate of tax relief = 15% for all relevant tax years</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>* Note: After year 7, the non-first time buyers' rate applies</p><p>Notwithstanding the rates of tax relief listed above, Finance Act 2012 introduced a higher rate of 30% for individuals who purchased their first principal private residence on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2008.  This higher rate of relief applies for the tax years 2012 to 2017.  The rationale for this higher rate was to help address the particular problems faced by those who bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.</p><p>Further detailed information in relation to mortgage interest relief is available from Tax and Duty Manual 08.03.08 which is available on the Revenue website at .</p><p>The gradual phasing-out of Mortgage Interest Relief has been under way since 2009.  No new mortgages taken out since January 2013 have qualified for the relief, and the relief has expired for qualifying mortgages taken out prior to 2004.  Relief for all remaining recipients is currently due to expire at the end of 2017.  The Programme for Government contained a commitment to retain Mortgage Interest Relief beyond the current end date on a tapered basis, and in my Budget speech I confirmed my intention to extend the relief to 2020.  The details of this extension will be set out in Budget 2018 next year, and the Deputy may also be aware that a review of policy considerations and potential costs of such an extension was contained in the Income Tax Reform Plan published by my Department in July this year.</p></reply>

Irish legislation, in compliance with the Directive, provides for distance selling arrangements.  Under these arrangements, sales to customers in other Member States are liable to VAT in the Member State of the supplier, provided that the threshold appropriate to the Member State of the customer is not breached.  Where sales exceed the threshold in any particular Member State, the supplier must register and account for VAT in that Member State.</p>  <p>  Where a UK-based supplier sells goods to customers in Ireland, UK VAT is chargeable on those sales.  However, if the total of such supplies to Irish customers exceeds the Irish threshold of &euro;35,000, then the UK supplier must register charge and account for Irish VAT on sales to Irish customers.  If the threshold is not exceeded, the UK supplier can also opt to register and account for Irish VAT in this State on his or her distance sales.</p>  <p>  Revenue's overall approach to managing compliance is to undertake a range of targeted interventions that are most appropriate for dealing with the specific risks presented in individual cases including internet sales.  Their work is also supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) risk identification system and capture of data from multiple sources.  One of these sources is trading information received from merchant acquirers which contains indicators of cases involved in internet trading.</p>  <p>  Revenue's extensive range of measures and activities, designed to address shadow economy activity, includes exploiting the potential of new and emerging technology to identify tax evasion associated with internet trading and business activity.  This includes an increased focus on the use of "e"-audit techniques, which use statistical software to analyse electronic data.</p></reply>

Details must be provided where the income or other amounts exceed &euro;3,810 for the period of the return.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue is precluded by virtue of taxpayer confidentiality from divulging any information relating to an individual or a company.  Accordingly I am not in a position to provide the information sought by the Deputy on the company concerned.</p>  <p>  Rent-a-Room relief is provided for in section 216A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting of a room or rooms as residential accommodation in his or her home and from meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting are exempt from income tax, USC and PRSI where they are below the annual limit for the tax year in which the sums arise and certain other conditions are satisfied.  The Rent-a Room relief is not available in respect of short-term guest accommodation.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in line with its overall approach to managing taxpayer compliance, it undertakes risk targeted interventions appropriate to the specific risks presented in individual cases this includes periodic programmes that examine the validity of claims to tax credits and reliefs.  Where, following a compliance intervention, it is found that a person had made an incorrect claim for a relief, including the Rent-a-Room relief, Revenue will take appropriate action to collect the tax due and interest on late payment and penalties, as appropriate.  I am advised by Revenue that their data systems do not facilitate the extraction of data relating specifically to compliance interventions on the Rent-a-Room relief.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is unclear what the Deputy refers to by 'registration of short term stay accommodation'.  However, I would point out that tourist accommodation is primarily, a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as F&aacute;ilte Ireland has specific powers and functions in relation to the registration, approval and grading of tourist accommodation. </p></reply>

The employment of external supervisors may enable some schools to remain open but would present significant logistical and practical difficulties. </p>  <p>  ASTI's co-operation with the contingency arrangements are required if they are to operate effectively.  Prior to the ballot results, my Department formally communicated its co-operation requirements to ASTI and asked that these be considered.  However, ASTI is refusing to cooperate with the contingency plans.  Firstly, ASTI rejected my request to provide an exemption for principals who are members of ASTI to allow them to co-operate with the contingency arrangements.  The co-operation of school principals is crucial to any contingency arrangements.  Secondly, ASTI rejected my request to provide sufficient notice to allow schools to recruit supervisors by providing only three weeks from the announcement of the ballot results until the date that ASTI teachers withdraw from S&amp;S duties.</p>  <p>  The contingency plan involves schools recruiting external personnel to supervise pupils on the school premises, in classrooms and the school yard.  Payment will be a minimum of &euro;38.36 per day (based on two hours supervision minimum).  Any further supervision above these two hours will be paid at a rate of &euro;19.18 per additional hour. Applicants being considered for appointment will be subject to vetting by the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Advertisement for the recruitment of supervisors began last week.  However, given the refusal to cooperate with the contingency arrangements on ASTI's part, widespread school closure is expected from 7 November onwards. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-25a.475.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102500065#WRJ00500"><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including children who are exceptionally able, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes, which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions delivered by fully-qualified professional teachers with the support of special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p><p>The 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able.  The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan.  It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.</p><p>Schools at both primary and post primary level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.</p><p>The revised primary curriculum recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.  Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability.</p><p>Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised.  Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated.  The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels. </p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment (CCEA), produced guidelines entitled &quot;Exceptionally Able Students &ndash; Guidelines for Teachers&quot; which issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback. </p><p>The NCCA/CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning.  The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students.  The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools. </p><p>Whole School Evaluations (WSEs) are carried out in primary and post-primary schools. During these inspections, the quality of the school management and leadership, the quality of teaching, learning and assessment, and the school's own planning and self-review is evaluated, including special education provision.  The way in which schools are inspected during WSE varies somewhat with slightly different processes in primary and post-primary schools.  Sometimes the inspection has a subject or curriculum focus and at other times, concentration is on a range of different lessons across a wide range of subjects.  Oral feedback is provided to the school community at the end of these inspections and a printed report which is published on my Department's website is also provided.</p><p>The Special Education Support Service (SESS), under the management of my Department, provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able.  The service is available to schools who may be seeking advice or support relating to a specific special education issue in the school.  More information on the range of programmes offered by the SESS is available on <i>www.sess.ie</i>. </p><p>In addition, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), also under the management of my Department, provides training in differentiation, in terms of differentiating for all pupils, whether less able/more able. Issues around exceptional ability and giftedness are addressed as part of the school planning process which is facilitated by the PDST.</p><p>I welcome the suggestions contained in the leaflet from the Group to which the Deputy refers relating to gifted and exceptionally able children, the majority of which are being implemented as outlined above.</p></reply>

These guidelines will be published after consultation with the education partners. </p><p>I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p><p>In relation to international comparisons, the OECD's Education at a Glance 2016 publication indicates that the annual public expenditure on public educational institutions per student (in equivalent US dollars converted using purchasing power parities for GDP) is 7,845 in Ireland and 9,114 in the United Kingdom.  These figures relate to 2013 which is the most recent year for which such international comparisons are available.  Northern Ireland is included in the figures for the United Kingdom.  The OECD average is 8,383 which gives Ireland an OECD ranking of 19<sup>th</sup>out of 32.</p></reply>

Historically these apprenticeships have been concentrated in sectors where employment is largely male and as a result female participation has been low.  There are efforts to increase female participation in the current trades, including a bursary scheme, however, despite this the number of female apprentices remain low.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council is currently overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers. 25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.  The first of these new apprenticeships, the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, was launched last month with further new apprenticeships to be launched later this year and early next year.  Many of these new apprenticeships are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and as a result will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months</p>  <p>  Accompanying the expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign. SOLAS will examine how this campaign can assist with promoting apprenticeship to women and to their potential employers.</p>  <p>  Recruitment of apprentices is undertaken directly by employers and in all cases the apprentice enters into a contract of employment.  The individual in question should be advised to contact their local Intreo Office as this network maintain close links with local employers and are best placed to assist her in her search for employment, including potential apprenticeship opportunities.</p></reply>

Each centre would offer education across the full range of sectoral teacher education, from early childhood to adult education, and possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity.</p>  <p>  Following from the Panel's report, a number of incorporations of ITE providers and collaborations between providers have taken place, or are in the process of taking place.  These changes complement other changes to the content and length of teacher education, with a greater emphasis on literacy, numeracy and pedagogical skills.</p>  <p>  The Church of Ireland College of Education (CICE) was incorporated into Dublin City University (DCU) with effect from 1 October 2016, as part of this reform process.  The incorporation took place in accordance with a detailed agreement between CICE and DCU in respect of the terms and conditions of the staff of the college following the incorporation. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware of a small number of industrial relations issues that have arisen in the context of the incorporation process.

These guidelines will be published after consultation with the education partners. </p><p>I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p></reply>

The full text of the agreement is available on my Department's website at the following address:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The agreement substantially addresses the current difference in pay between those recruited since 2011 and those recruited since 2012.  It will result in increases of up to &euro;2,000 per year for new teachers at the start of their careers.  The increase varies depending on the point of scale that a teacher is on</p><p>- the highest increase being &euro;7,700 and the increase at the maximum of the scale being &euro;4,300.  It is estimated that over a teacher's career the value of these increases will be &euro;135,000.  This, in combination with measures already agreed and implemented under the Haddington Road Agreement, will restore approximately three quarters of the reductions<b></b>for new entrants put in place since 2011 in terms of career earnings.</p><p>The revised salary arrangement will be implemented in two phases on 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018. </p><p>When other Lansdowne Road increases are also factored in, there will be a 15% increase in the starting pay of new entrant teachers between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).  For an individual TUI/INTO member who started teaching in September 2015, they will see a 22% increase in their pay (including increment) between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).</p><p>The typical starting pay for a primary teacher in 2010 was &euro;36,890, comprising of basic salary of &euro;31,972 and an honours degree allowance of &euro;4,918.  Such teachers may also have been entitled to incremental credit for other service.  The teacher could also have received an additional payment of &euro;1,769 per annum if they had opted in to the Supervision and Substitution scheme.</p><p>The typical starting pay for a post-primary teacher in 2010 teacher was &euro;39,195, comprising of basic salary of &euro;33,041 and an honours degree allowance of &euro;4,918 and an allowance for the Higher Diploma in Education of &euro;1,236.  Such teachers may also have been entitled to incremental credit for other service.  The teacher could also have received an additional payment of &euro;1,769 per annum if they had opted in to the Supervision and Substitution scheme.</p><p>The typical starting pay for a primary and post-primary teacher from January 2018 onwards will be &euro;35,602.</p><p>There are some exceptional circumstances where a teacher may enter the teaching profession in January 2018 but be entitled to access the salary scale that existed prior 2011.  For example, a teacher may have previously worked as a teacher in the public service of another EU state and may have a period of service prior to 1 January 2011 which would allow them to be placed on the pre 2011 scale.  In circumstances such as these, a primary teacher starting in January 2018 would be on a starting salary of &euro;39,482 comprising of basic salary of &euro;34,564 and an honours degree allowance of &euro;4,918 and including increases under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. </p><p>A post-primary teacher starting in January 2018, under the same circumstances, would have a starting pay of &euro;41,787 comprising of basic salary of &euro;35,633 and an honours degree allowance of &euro;4,918 and an allowance for the Higher Diploma in Education of &euro;1,236.  Such teachers may also have been entitled to incremental credit for other service.</p><p>The Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p></reply>

Its functions are set out in the Teaching Council Act, 2001.  In accordance with Section 38 of that Act, the Council reviews and, where appropriate, accredits programmes of initial teacher education (ITE).  The Council's criteria for accreditation are set out under a range of headings including Programme Inputs, Processes and Outcomes. Under the heading &ldquo;Programme Inputs&rdquo;, programme providers seeking accreditation are required to detail, inter alia, the way in which methodologies, pedagogical content knowledge and studies in relation to philosophy of education are integrated into their programmes.</p>  <p>  In carrying out its statutory accreditation role, the Teaching Council seeks to ensure a level of consistency across all ITE programmes provided in Ireland.  This does not imply uniformity, and it is open to providers of ITE programmes to incorporate different philosophies of education, including Montessori education, into their programmes of Initial Teacher Education.  As such, there is considerable variety across programmes, and the Teaching Council welcomes this.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has considered how Montessori education can be best positioned in the continuum of teacher education, and has consulted and recently met with Montessori teacher educators with the ultimate aim of supporting students' learning. It understands that a provider is currently considering a redesign to its programme so that it might meet the Teaching Council's ITE criteria, and its graduates could be eligible to register as primary teachers.  The Council is happy to engage further with the provider in question, and awaits a submission applying for accreditation.</p></reply>

Each housing authority is required to make an allocation scheme specifying, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households and classes of households on the waiting list.  Allocation schemes may also contain provisions for exceptional or emergency cases, allowing immediate housing outside of normal waiting list priorities, should circumstances warrant it.</p><p>Victims of domestic violence who seek emergency accommodation from a housing authority are generally placed in temporary accommodation which the council itself arranges or which is operated by a voluntary service provider.  It is not necessary for such persons to go on the general housing waiting list to avail of short-term emergency housing.  Such support can be provided where victims of domestic violence meet the homeless definition set out in the Housing Act 1988, which is not prescriptive and in practice will generally include victims of domestic violence.</p><p>Where victims of domestic violence need continued State support to meet their housing needs, housing authorities are encouraged to work with all service providers to ensure that a victim's housing eligibility and need is assessed in a timely manner.  This assessment is carried out in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, which includes a review of the suitability of the household's current accommodation having regard to &quot;particular household circumstances&quot; or &quot;exceptional medical or compassionate grounds&quot;.  This allows a housing authority to consider a victim of domestic violence as having a housing need and place her (or him) on a housing list.</p><p>My Department continues to liaise with Cosc in relation to the implementation of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  While there is no proposal to redefine victims of domestic violence as a specific category of prioritised housing need, <i>Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness</i>, which was published on 19 July 2016, commits to the development and publication of procedural guidance for housing authorities with regard to the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence in securing new independent tenancies.  It is expected that this will be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

It is my aim that all reasonable steps are taken to secure the re-use of vacant and under-utilised properties for residential purposes, particularly in the many towns and villages in rural Ireland that contain a significant number of empty houses.  Action 5.1 of the Action Plan provides for the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by early 2017 and within this context, I intend to examine the potential to widen the geographical range of social housing location options available to persons seeking such accommodation. </p><p>The Strategy will examine the potential for bringing existing but vacant housing back into beneficial use and will also consider mechanisms to match such accommodation potential to prospective applicants for social housing, through measures such as the Repair and Leasing Initiative, which will see up-front financial assistance being made available to upgrade empty, but sub-standard, accommodation in return for leasing the property back for social housing purposes.  Acquisition and leasing options are also available to local authorities to ensure that households needing accommodation may be provided with that accommodation. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has overall responsibility for regional and rural matters and is advancing a broadly-based rural development strategy, in the context of<i>A Programme for a Partnership Government.</i>In conjunction with this overarching Strategy, the development of a rural resettlement programme will be considered further in the context of taking forward the range of measures set out in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i><i>Action Plan</i>.</p></reply>

In order for a household to qualify for social housing support, a housing authority must carry out an assessment to establish whether the household meets specified eligibility requirements, including income eligibility requirements, and has a housing need, as defined in the Housing Acts.</p>  <p>  Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.  The assessment of applications for social housing support is solely a matter for housing authorities, having regard to the circumstances of the household concerned.</p></reply>

The Acts do not define a single dwelling and, while single dwellings are self-evident in most cases, consideration of a range of factors may be required on a case by case basis and may ultimately require interpretation by the Courts.   </p>  <p>  A single dwelling is generally either a dwelling house, a flat (separate and self-contained premises constructed or adapted for residential use and forming part of a building from some other part of which it is divided horizontally) or a maisonette (a dwelling forming part of a larger building, which has its rooms divided between two or more levels which are more than half a storey height apart).</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the exclusion of single dwellings from the provision of the Fire Services Act, very considerable progress has been made on enhancing the safety of occupants of dwellings through community fire safety programmes and fire safety promotion over the years.  This has focussed on the domestic smoke alarm campaign and, while each fire death is one too many, the fire death rate per million has been halved over the past decade.</p>  <p>  The construction standards for dwellings are covered by regulation.  Part B (Fire safety) of the Building Regulations sets down the statutory minimum standards of fire safety provision which must be achieved when a new building, including a dwelling, is designed and constructed or when an existing building is subject to works involving an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use.  This includes a requirement for adequate resistance to the spread of fire to and from neighbouring buildings.    </p>  <p>  Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety (2006) provides specific guidance on construction methods to comply with this requirement.

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, enforcement of RTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  Given the demand for enforcement, it is not sustainable for the RTB to initiate proceedings on all requests.  As the Board was established to take cases out of the Courts, it endeavours to secure enforcement initially by non-judicial means. </p>  <p>  While there is no legal obligation on the RTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2015 alone, it referred 312 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment, of an award. In many cases the best option - and one which the RTB facilitates - is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments. </p>  <p>  Section 124 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides for the enforcement of RTB determination orders in the Circuit Court.  Section 57 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 amends section 124 to provide for the enforcement of RTB determination orders through the District Court rather than the Circuit Court.  This will considerably reduce the expense of enforcing a determination order and may in some cases provide for faster hearings, as there are more sittings of the District Court than the Circuit Court.  Section 57 is subject to a Commencement Order which will be made in the coming months.</p></reply>

In particular, engaging with banks and investment companies in respect of their vacant/available property portfolios, which normally span a number of local authority jurisdictions, benefits from a national approach.  In that context, the Agency currently acts as a central co-ordination body at national level for banks/investors to interact with.  This activity began in early 2015 and to date has yielded 172 properties across 29 local authorities at a total value of just over &euro;25m. </p>  <p>  It is intended to formalise, extend and support this activity by directly funding the Housing Agency for these acquisitions.  As a new initiative identified in Rebuilding Ireland, the Housing Agency is to be provided with capital funding with the specific focus of engaging with banks and investment companies to acquire properties for social housing nationally, thereby increasing social housing delivery. </p>  <p>  Under the new acquisitions programme the Housing Agency will use a rotating fund of &euro;70m which will be immediately available in 2017, to acquire vacant properties from banks and private equity investment funds in areas with high levels of social housing demand.  In doing this, the Agency will be in close consultation with local authorities to ensure that suitable properties are only purchased in areas where there is a demand for social housing.  It is estimated that this mechanism will deliver some 1,600 units over the period to 2020. </p>  <p>  Properties purchased by the Agency will be passed on to Approved Housing Bodies and local authorities, who will purchase these units from the Housing Agency utilising loans from the Housing Finance Agency or other lending institutions, remunerated using funding under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (i.e. payment and availability type arrangements), and capital funding, as appropriate.  This would allow the Agency's &euro;70m fund to be replenished to purchase more properties.   </p></reply>

A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness this potential, and bring these vacant houses into social housing use to provide   homes for families on local authority waiting lists. </p>  <p>  The new scheme has just been launched in Waterford and Carlow on a pilot basis, and depending on the take-up from private property owners, will be rolled out to further local authorities early in 2017.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is workable from local authorities' and AHBs' perspectives.  It is anticipated that other local authorities will come into the scheme on a rolling basis, with full roll-out expected within 6 months.   </p>  <p>  AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.  Several AHBs will be working together with Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas.  As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will become involved with local authorities in the delivery of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or the AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.   </p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.   </p>  <p>  The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  Early estimates are that at least 150 units will be secured in 2017 and up to 3,500 properties will be targeted over the next five years.

My Department's role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  The capital allocations in respect of Traveller-specific accommodation for 2015 and 2016, and amounts recouped in 2015 and to date in 2016 are set out in the table below.  Typically, the bulk of expenditure occurs in the last quarter of the year, having regard to lead in times for planning, design and construction of capital projects.  To ensure maximum expenditure and delivery of accommodation, local authorities submit quarterly profiles of expenditure to my Department.  These are monitored against actual expenditure and if a difficulty is identified in drawing down funding allocated for a particular scheme during the year, it is reallocated to another scheme.  Expenditure during 2016 is being closely monitored and my Department is currently contacting every relevant local authority in order to ensure that drawdown is maximised.</p><p><i></i>My Department also provides current funding for accommodation-related supports to operate in tandem with the capital programme.  Current funding of &euro;4.3m is being provided in 2016.  Over &euro;3.2m has been recouped to local authorities in 2016 to date, of which&euro;0.943m was self-funded by local authorities from surplus Local Property Tax receipts.  A similar level of current funding will be provided in 2017.</p><p>Capital funding of &euro;9m is being provided for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2017, an increase of &euro;3.5m (64%) on the 2016 allocation.  This is the second consecutive year that the Traveller Accommodation capital budget has been increased. Included in this is provision to assist local authorities with the costs of capital works arising from the fire safety review of traveller-specific accommodation. <i></i></p><p>As regards the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation and associated funding, the Programme for Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' Traveller Accommodation Plans and consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.  This commitment has been underpinned in Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which provides for the commissioning by the Housing Agency of an expert, independent review of Traveller accommodation expenditure and delivery of units, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes.  The review has commenced and is due to be completed in quarter two of 2017. The review will provide factual information and a key platform for the special working group to progress its work effectively.  The working group will be established as soon as possible after completion of the review.<table><tr><th>County Council </th><th>Capital Allocation - 2015 - &euro; </th><th>Recouped - 2015 - &euro; </th><th>Capital Allocation - 2016 - &euro; </th><th>Recouped to date - 2016 - &euro; </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>130,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>8,600 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>37,000 </td><td>0 </td><td>200,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>149,000 </td><td>0 </td><td>30,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>0 </td><td>4,750 </td><td>82,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>63,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td>645,000 </td><td>1,113,425* </td><td>26,842 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown </td><td>0 </td><td>1,592,429 </td><td>419,095 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>117,000 </td><td>3,810 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>4,550 </td><td>3,810 </td><td>57,000 </td><td>198,730 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>200,000 </td><td>0 </td><td>200,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>551,626 </td><td>397,577 </td><td>377,500 </td><td>107,356 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>0 </td><td>30,600 </td><td>0 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>0 </td><td>65,975 </td><td>18,800 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>78,000 </td><td>88,966 </td><td>2,900 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>0 </td><td>7,620 </td><td>0 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>120,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>3,069 </td><td>85,000 </td><td>73,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>19,622 </td><td>0 </td><td>50,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>800,000 </td><td>23,142 </td><td>900,000 </td><td>1,059,189 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>95,000 </td><td>0 </td><td>208,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>0 </td><td>30,906 </td><td>96,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>63,097 </td><td>27,891 </td><td>46,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>City Council </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>800,000 </td><td>427,304 </td><td>400,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>366,299 </td><td>99,162 </td><td>1,405,198 </td><td>238,861 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>0 </td><td>62,150 </td><td>40,000 </td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Traveller Accommodation: Capital Allocations and Amounts Recouped</b><table><tr><th>City County Council </th><th>Capital Allocation - 2015 - &euro; </th><th>Recouped - 2015 - &euro; </th><th>Capital Allocation - 2016 - &euro; </th><th>Recouped to date - 2016 - &euro; </th></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>7,500(City &amp;amp; County Councils merged in 2014) </td><td>68,923(City &amp;amp; County merged in 2014) </td><td>81,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>413,347 (City &amp;amp; County Councils merged in 2014) </td><td>0 </td><td>263,000 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reserve </td><td>66,890 </td><td></td><td>85,065 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>4,300,000 </td><td>4,129, 630 </td><td>5,500,000 </td><td>1,607,946 </td></tr></table><i>*Includes &euro;55,000 which was self-funded by Fingal County Council from surplus Local Property Tax receipts.</i></p></reply>

There is a strong social benefit accruing from this funding in terms of supporting older people and people with a disability to continue to live independently in their own homes and, in some cases, to avoid an outcome where people may otherwise require social housing.  The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to support further increases in funding given these benefits and the peace of mind the grants provide.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to local authorities for a range of programmes that support local authorities to improve the housing conditions of social housing tenants.  This includes funding for adaptations and extensions to the social housing stock to meet the needs of local authority tenants with a disability or to address serious overcrowding.  Funding for the latter has increased over recent years and as with the private house grants, my Department stays in ongoing contact with local authorities regarding the implementation of the schemes, with authorities having the option in recent years to draw down additional funding to address backlogs.  On the basis of current funding drawdown for adaptations and extensions to the social housing stock, I intend to provide significant funding for the scheme again in 2017.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  The system of making retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax estimated to have cost some &euro;50m annually.</p><p>The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made on-line at <i>www.motortax.ie</i>or through the local motor tax office.  The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month of tax or a previously made declaration of non-use to remind motorists that the vehicle must be taxed or declared off the road for a further period.</p><p>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation for the category of vehicle concerned.  A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.</p><p>These arrangements were well publicised at the time of introduction of the legislation.</p><p>The legislation does not provide for exemptions from the foregoing requirements.  This is to protect the revised arrangements; allowing an owner to declare a vehicle off the road after the expiry of a current declaration of non-use could potentially be a move back to the system of retrospective declarations, thereby undermining the overall objective of the legislative change.</p></reply>

The Guidelines were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.</p><p>Furthermore, the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme is central to the medium- to long-term strategy for the reduction and management of flood risk in Ireland.  The Programme delivers on core components of the <font color="#2F2F2F"> National </font>Flood Policy, adopted in 2004, and on the requirements of the EU Floods Directive.  The Irish CFRAM Programme is being carried out in parallel with similar programmes across the European Union.</p><p>In addition to this, the Office of Public Works (OPW) is the lead agency for flood risk management in Ireland and is the national competent authority for the EU Floods Directive. OPW works in close partnership with all Local Authorities in delivering the objectives of the CFRAM Programme.</p><p>Implementation of the requirements of the EU Floods Directive is being coordinated with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive and the current River Basin Management Plans.  The Programme is also being undertaken with close cross-border coordination.  The main objective of this Programme is to identify areas which are at risk from flooding, to evaluate the level of risk and map the risk assessments. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Guidelines, together with the data arising from CFRAM, are being used effectively to measure risk and inform future decisions about the use of lands.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Programme incorporates a range of specific actions to help address vacancy and dereliction, for example, proposals to:</p>  <p>  - introduce a similar scheme to the &ldquo;Living City Initiative&rdquo; to regenerate town centres and villages throughout the country;</p>  <p>  - establish a national register of derelict sites, in addition to the register of vacant sites required under the new vacant site levy provisions, to bring vacant and under-utilised sites into beneficial use for housing and regeneration purposes;</p>  <p>  - mandate local authorities with better land management powers, including the possibility of additional Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) capabilities;</p>  <p>  - reclassify and incentivise the use of under-utilised or vacant areas over ground-floor premises in towns, for both residential and commercial use; and</p>  <p>  - reform the Derelict Sites Act 1990, and tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land by the State, semi-State and private sectors. </p>  <p>  In addition, Action 5.1 of the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland undertakes to develop a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by early 2017.  To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group with senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself.  Its first meeting was held on 30 September and it is due to meet again later this month. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency are liaising with local authorities and with the Central Statistics Office in order to obtain a better understanding of the numbers, characteristics and reasons why homes are vacant.  A number of local authorities have commenced, or are planning to commence, pilot programmes to identify vacant homes and bring them back into use; these pilot programmes will inform the Strategy.  In addition, the Strategy will be informed by international best practice and experience, and research is being undertaken in this area.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of new initiatives have recently been announced which specifically target vacant properties.  The new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is aimed at assisting local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to bring vacant private houses into social housing use, providing homes for families on local authority waiting lists.  The new Scheme will operate initially in Waterford and Carlow and my Department will work closely with other local authorities to roll it out around the country over the course of the next six months.  I have secured &euro;140 million for the successful implementation of this Scheme over the next five years.  This Scheme has significant potential and I am hopeful that it can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition, under a new &ldquo;Buy and Renew&rdquo; initiative, my Department will support local authorities and AHBs to purchase private housing units in need of remediation, and renew them with the aim of making them available for social housing use.  An initial capital provision of &euro;25 million will be available for this initiative in 2017.</p>  <p>  With regard to the question of supports to obtain CPOs to buy key vacant and derelict sites, it should be noted that a large number of State bodies and authorities already have CPO powers, all of which are underpinned by different statutes. </p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations set the maximum net income limits for each housing authority in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.</p>  <p>  The determination of the bands and the authority area assigned to each band was based on a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation and takes account of the variation in the cost of private rented accommodation across the country.</p>  <p>  The principle used to determine what was reasonably affordable for any household was the relationship of household income to the cost of providing suitable accommodation in the private sector, where the percentage of net income required in order to pay for accommodation costs did not exceed 30%. </p>  <p>  The limits set in 2011 also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Most payments received from the Department of Social Protection are assessable as income, including Family Income Supplement.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and housing authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  However, these limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda.</p></reply>

The Programme further provides that we will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness emphasises the need to look at new ways of funding social housing delivery, in particular the need to provide structural, funding and policy supports to increase delivery of social housing by Approved Housing Bodies.  In that context, it states that support will be provided to an Irish Council for Social Housing/sector led new special purpose vehicle, involving investors which could potentially include the credit union movement.</p>  <p>  Credit union representative bodies have also set out a proposed means by which funding could be provided by credit unions to Approved Housing Bodies for the development of social housing.  My Department and the Department of Finance have met with these bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of financing social housing delivery.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016.  Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications, including to Regulation 25(2), which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing.</p>  <p>  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.  My Department and the Department of Finance met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the funding mechanisms required will have to be put in place in the first instance by the credit union bodies themselves, with the support of their members and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  My Department will continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.</p></reply>

A &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment for all social welfare payments will commence from March, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment (including jobseekers on age-related reduced rates of payment).  </p>  <p>  Approximately 1.5 million people will benefit from this increase, from pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents, maternity and paternity benefit recipients and jobseekers.</p>  <p>  Jobseeker's allowance (JA) and Supplementary Welfare Allowance claimants under the age of 26 generally receive age-related reduced rates of payment.  Age-related reduced rates of payment do not apply in certain circumstances, however, such as when the claimant has a dependent child, or transferred to JA from Disability Allowance, or was in State care during the 12 months prior to applying for JA.</p>  <p>  Increasing the &euro;100 and &euro;144 rates by &euro;5 per week, instead of proportionate increases, would cost an additional &euro;3 million in a full year.  This includes the cost of increasing the qualified adult rates from &euro;100 to &euro;105 per week in the case of those on the &euro;100 rate, and from &euro;124.80 to &euro;128.10 per week, for those on the &euro;144 rate.  </p>  <p>  The long-standing practice of my Department is to award proportionate increases for people who are on reduced rates of payment and for qualified adults.  If the full increase was awarded to some categories of people on reduced rates, and not to others, this would not be fair to others on reduced rates of payment.  </p>  <p>  The rationale for having reduced rates of payment for young jobseekers in receipt of a means-tested jobseeker's payment is to prevent young people from entering welfare dependency by providing a strong financial incentive to take up a job, or a training or education programme.</p>  <p>  Financial incentives already exist for young people taking up education, training and employment supports.  Young people participating in employment programmes such as Community Employment, T&uacute;s and Gateway already receive the full adult rate of payment, which is currently &euro;210.50 per week and will rose to &euro;215.50 next year. </p>  <p>  From next September, when a young jobseeker participates in my Department's Back to Education scheme, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker's payment which will then be &euro;193 per week (for people of any age), as against the &euro;160 which they are currently on. </p>  <p>  This 21% increase represents an extra &euro;33 a week, and demonstrates the State's support for young jobseekers who seek to enhance their skills.  The rate payable to young jobseeker's who participate on Solas training courses is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The number of young people on the Live Register on jobseekers payments was close to 90,000 in 2010 and is now down to 34,000.  There is a continuing strong downward trend this year with the numbers down from 42,000 to 34,000 since the beginning of 2016.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment has fallen by 5 percentage points in the last year alone and it is now below the EU average.  Of course more remains to be done and I am determined that we help more young people in the most effective way possible, by helping them into the workforce or education.</p></reply>

The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000, and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  Over 1,200 loans were drawn down under the Scheme during the pilot with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down was &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments were then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union. </p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>provides for the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim.  Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the loan scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.  To help advance this aim, I have written to all Credit Union Chairpersons and Managers, to encourage their participation.  </p><p>The list of credit unions offering the scheme is updated regularly and is available at the attached link <i>www.itmakessenseloan.ie/participating-credit-unions</i>and on the <i>It Makes Sense</i>Facebook page. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;30.3 million for the ENP scheme in 2016.</p><p>ENP payments are made at the discretion of the Department's officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual or family in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.

Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department's spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.    </p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. </p>  <p>  The conditions for the State pension contributory (SPC) are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and there have been a number of changes over the years which impact upon whether someone qualifies or not.  The main such changes in recent years are as follows:</p>  <p>  1. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (Transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  While its abolition would not realise that saving in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments (although at a lower rate than that of the State pension), and some may have claimed an Increase for a Qualified Adult on their spouse's pensions, it is estimated that well over half of that cost may have been saved each year as a result of this measure.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;75-80 million.</p>  <p>  2. &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System &ndash; Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 (i.e. 10 years) and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012.</p>  <p>  At the time this measure was introduced, the Exchequer annual savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum in the short term, but rising substantially on a cumulative basis in the long term.  It is not possible to state how much has been saved by this change now, as people who are below the current threshold will not generally make a claim to SPC.</p>  <p>  3. As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for SPC were introduced.  The new bands, which replaced the bands which were in place from 2000-2012, more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of only 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the exchequer savings arising from the current rate bands (relative to the ones in place from 2000-2012) will be at least &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10m annually.  This figure represents only the savings in respect of current SPC claims, and does not include savings where the person has claimed an alternative payment as a result of the bands, such as a Non-Contributory Pension or an Increase for a Qualified Adult.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate SPC, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the SPC.  Alternatively, if a person's spouse or civil partner is in receipt of an SPC they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is 90% of the maximum personal rate of the SPC.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.    </p>  <p>  A yearly average of 48-52 weeks contributions is required to qualify for a 100% rate pension of &euro;233.30, and banded payments apply for those with lower yearly averages.  For example, where someone entered insurable employment aged 16 and had 2,000 weekly contributions (38.5 years) paid and/or credited, they would have a yearly average of 40, and would receive a pension at 98% of the full rate (for those in the 40-47 band).</p>  <p>  People who qualify for lower band rates may, if they satisfy the means-test, qualify for the State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the additional cost of paying all current State pension (contributory) payments at the maximum rate would amount to just over &euro;309 million per annum.  However, this would not be the full cost to the Social Insurance Fund of such a move.  These costings do not take into account people who qualify for a reduced rate of State Pension Contributory, but instead are paid a State Pension (non-contributory), or an Increase for Qualified Adult payment, due to receiving a more favourable rate.  It is thought that a significant number of such pensioners would qualify for a full rate State pension contributory instead, if that became payable to everyone who satisfied the relevant criteria, and that the additional cost of that change could be expected to be quite significant.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the 'yearly average' system with a 'total contributions approach'.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This demand is driven by demographic trends and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  The estimates are constructed using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant factors as are available for that portion of the year in which the estimate is constructed. </p><p>In this regard, there are decreases in 2017 in the allocations for Working Age Income and Employment Supports, reflecting the lower demand for many of the schemes arising from the improved labour market.  Conversely, there are increases in the allocations for Pensions, Illness, Disability and Carers, and Children, reflecting demographic and other trends.  This is in line with the 2016 Mid-Year Expenditure Report.</p><p>Full details of the allocations for each of my Department's schemes in 2017 compared to 2016 can be found in Vote 37 in Part III of the Expenditure Report 2017, which is available on the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform website, <i>budget.gov.ie. </i></p></reply>

It was paid to 390,958 recipients in 2015.  The estimated cost of the scheme in 2016 is &euro;224 million.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approx. 421,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is a means tested payment, targeted at those who are more vulnerable to energy poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  As short term payments such as illness benefits are not means tested payments, they do not qualify for the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a recipient of a social welfare or health service executive payment who has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources may qualify for a heating supplement.  There is no standard rate for a heating supplement.  Each case is examined on its merits and the Community Welfare Officer determines the amount to be paid taking account of the level of the expenses in question and the ability of the applicant to contribute towards his or her exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance would have to be considered in the overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  One of the conditions of the State pension (contributory) is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  </p><p>Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim. </p><p>Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p><p>Work is underway to replace the 'yearly average' system with a 'total contributions approach'.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons will be considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

At the Foreign Affairs Council meeting, Ireland and the EU strongly condemned the excessive and disproportionate attacks by the regime and its allies against civilians.  Ministers also called on Russia to demonstrate all efforts to halt indiscriminate bombing by the Syrian regime, restore a cessation of hostilities, ensure immediate humanitarian access and create the conditions for a credible and inclusive political transition.  This is critical to save the lives of Syrian citizens, particularly those who remain in Aleppo.  Ministers were also united that the situation in Syria should be referred to the International Criminal Court in order to ensure legal accountability for the victims of the unspeakable crimes that have been committed against them.  I believe that the only viable and sustainable way forward remains a comprehensive end to violence and a Syrian-own and Syrian-led political resolution, based on a real political transition process.  That remains my objective and that of the EU, and is reflected in the conclusions adopted by the FAC. </p>  <p>  Ministers also exchanged views on the follow up to and implementation of the EU Global Strategy (EUGS).  I stressed the need to carry forward work on each of the elements of the Strategy &ndash; including our approach to resolution of conflicts and crises - in an integrated way.  I also welcomed the commitment in the Strategy to continue to mainstream human rights; women, peace and security and gender equality in EU policies.  These two important elements were reflected in the Conclusions adopted by EU Foreign Ministers.  The security and defence aspects of the Strategy will be presented to Foreign and Defence Ministers at the November FAC meeting.  This will focus on enhancing the EU's peace-keeping capacity in support of the United Nations through the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy as defined in the Lisbon Treaty.</p>  <p>  The Council discussed progress in implementing the EU response to the migration crisis.  The EU has made a lot of progress in the past 18 months; however, this needs to be complemented by a more determined and coherent effort to address the root causes of recent mass migration to Europe.  Strengthening our collective capacity to promote and protect human rights, development cooperation, conflict resolution and global governance externally will help build societies that are more responsive to their citizens' needs.  The discussion will help to prepare the next European Council meetings.</p>  <p>  I joined Ministers in supporting the transition underway in Tunisia.  The EU aims to provide support to Tunisia through a balanced package of financial and non-financial measures and high-level and ambitious political dialogue.  Council conclusions reflecting the commitment of the EU to Tunisia were also adopted.</p></reply>

The conflict in Syria is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our generation.  Since 2012, Ireland has provided a total of &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region.  At present, it is Ireland's largest response to any humanitarian crisis. </p>  <p>  At last week's European Council, EU leaders strongly condemned the ongoing aerial attacks on Aleppo by the Syrian regime and Russia and urged both states to bring an immediate end to the atrocities being committed.  They repeated calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and stressed that all necessary steps be taken to ensure humanitarian access to Syria.  The need to ensure that those who have committed atrocities and breached humanitarian law are held to account was also highlighted.  The question of sanctions in response to Russian and Syrian actions in Aleppo was also discussed.  It was agreed that the EU would consider all available options should the atrocities against the people of Aleppo continue.   </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stressed Ireland's concerns over the crisis in Syria and in Aleppo in particular.  I would underline that Russia is bound by international law to ensure the protection of the civilian population and unimpeded humanitarian access.</p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU's humanitarian response in Syria.  The EU is a leading donor in the international response to the Syrian crisis, and has pledged to contribute &euro;445 million in humanitarian assistance in 2016. The EU's funding inside Syria is focused on providing medical emergency relief, protection, food and nutritional assistance, water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter, health, and logistics services to civilians in need.  Beyond the Syrian border, EU funding ensures that people fleeing the country will receive life-saving assistance such as health, food, shelter, water and sanitation services, and protection.</p>  <p>   When I met with Commissioner Christos Stylianides, the European Commissioner with responsibility for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, in Dublin last month I was assured that EU officials are in daily contact with humanitarian partners on the ground, monitoring the situation as it develops and co-ordinating humanitarian activities with key partners and EU Member States. The Commissioner emphasised that the situation in Syria remains very unpredictable, underlining the need for humanitarian partners to remain engaged, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance can enable partners to respond quickly and appropriately to needs as they arise. </p>  <p>   I discussed with the Commissioner the EU's new Humanitarian Initiative for Aleppo, which was launched in rapid response to the recent and disturbing escalation of the conflict in Aleppo.  This joint EU-UN initiative includes two main elements: firstly, to facilitate the urgent delivery of basic life-saving assistance to civilians in eastern Aleppo; and secondly, to ensure the medical evacuations of wounded and sick, with a focus on women, children and the elderly. </p>  <p>   Ireland and our EU partners will continue to monitor the situation closely, and given its complexity and severity, I would expect that Ireland will provide additional support for people affected by the crisis in the coming months. </p></reply>

Since 2012, Ireland has provided a total of &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region.  At present, it is Ireland's largest response to any humanitarian crisis. </p>  <p>  Of the &euro;20 million in funding provided by Ireland so far in 2016, &euro;14 million has been delivered through the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, and &euro;6 million through the Department of Agriculture's support to the World Food Programme's Syria response.  </p>  <p>  Irish Aid funding seeks to meet the needs of those inside Syria, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have fled to neighbouring countries.  Funding is channelled through partners, including NGOs, UN organisations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, those who are best placed to respond.  These partners provide humanitarian supplies and urgently-needed health, education, water and sanitation services, as well as measures to protect children and vulnerable families.  In addition, members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps have been deployed to the Balkans and Middle East, providing much-needed surge capacity to UN agencies responding to migration challenges resulting from the Syrian conflict. </p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU's humanitarian response in Syria.  The EU is a leading donor in the international response to the Syrian crisis, and has pledged to contribute &euro;445 million in humanitarian assistance in 2016.  The EU's funding inside Syria is focused on providing medical emergency relief, protection, food and nutritional assistance, water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter, health, and logistics services to civilians in need.  Beyond the Syrian border, EU funding ensures that people fleeing the country will receive life-saving assistance such as health, food, shelter, water and sanitation services, and protection.</p>  <p>  When I met with Commissioner Christos Stylianides, the European Commissioner with responsibility for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, in Dublin last month I was assured that EU officials are in daily contact with humanitarian partners on the ground, monitoring the situation as it develops and coordinating humanitarian activities with key partners and EU Member States.  The Commissioner emphasised that the situation in Syria remains very unpredictable, underlining the need for humanitarian partners to remain engaged, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance can enable partners to respond quickly and appropriately to needs as they arise. </p>  <p>  I discussed with the Commissioner the EU's new Humanitarian Initiative for Aleppo, which was launched in rapid response to the recent and disturbing escalation of the conflict in Aleppo.  This joint EU-UN initiative includes two main elements: firstly, to facilitate the urgent delivery of basic life-saving assistance to civilians in eastern Aleppo; and secondly, to ensure the medical evacuations of wounded and sick, with a focus on women, children and the elderly. </p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners will continue to monitor the situation closely, and given its complexity and severity, I would expect that Ireland will provide additional support for people affected by the crisis in the coming months. </p></reply>

The earthquake destroyed much of Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas, left about 1.5 million people homeless and caused losses estimated at &euro;5.9 billion.</p>  <p>  Two months after the earthquake, the international community pledged US $4.5 billion at a donor conference in New York in response to a UN appeal for $1.5 billion.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2014, $3.52 billion had been provided.  </p>  <p>  Many donors however, were slow to release funds and aid did reach all affected communities.  There have been numerous reviews of aid delivery to Haiti post-earthquake and the findings were that the international community could have responded quicker and more effectively.</p>  <p>  Ireland, however, met its commitments to the people of Haiti in full. By the end of 2012, Ireland's pledge of &euro;13 million had been exceeded, with support reaching almost &euro;14 million.  In total, in the period 2010-2015, Ireland provided &euro;23.9 million in humanitarian and longer term development funding to Haiti.</p>  <p>  Since 2010, the European Commission has provided a total of &euro;272.95 million to assist victims of the earthquake, responding to humanitarian needs and supporting the improvement of basic social services.  A key focus of support was to strengthen local capacities in disaster preparedness. </p>  <p>  Although there has been significant progress since the 2010 earthquake, including the rebuilding of infrastructure and the restoration of livelihoods, Haiti remains vulnerable to natural hazards, such as Hurricane Matthew in recent weeks.  </p>  <p>  The impact of Hurricane Matthew has been devastating, causing widespread flooding, damage and displacement.  Through the leadership of the Government of Haiti, the international community has responded rapidly to address urgent humanitarian requirements, while also considering the longer terms needs of the affected communities.   </p>  <p>  Ireland responded quickly and effectively.  Through Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade organised an airlift of humanitarian supplies from Ireland's prepositioned stocks in Panama, to provide relief to 1,000 families in one of the worst affected areas.  So far, Ireland has provided &euro;1.76 million in funding to longstanding NGO partners, best placed to respond in Haiti for the provision of life saving assistance, including shelter, water, sanitation and health activities, and distribution of food.  A further airlift of non-food emergency supplies is planned.</p>  <p>  The UN issued a Flash Appeal seeking $119 million for the provision of life-saving assistance to 750,000 people over the coming three months.  The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund has released $5 million to address urgent needs. Ireland last year provided a total of &euro;11.75 million to the Central Emergency Relief Fund, and is its eighth highest donor.</p>  <p>  The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was also activated in response to a request from the Government of Haiti.  This led to the deployment of a Civil Protection Team, with twelve experts from five countries.  Ireland's Rapid Response Corps, managed by my Department, stands ready to deploy.  The EU has released funding of &euro;1.75 million in response to the hurricane.</p>  <p>  The work of the UN, the EU and the international community remains vital, ensuring that the people of Haiti can recover quickly and rebuild their livelihoods. We are continuing to monitor the situation in the country closely.</p></reply>

This is reflected particularly in the comprehensive conclusions on a 'Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Daesh threat', which were adopted by the Council in May this year.  Foreign Ministers have also focused on the contribution that the EU can make through external action to preventing and countering terrorism.  Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU's strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.  </p><p>The EU's approach is guided by, and is consistent with, the approach taken by the UN to countering Daesh and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2161 (2014) on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 (2014) on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training.  </p><p>The UN Secretary General's comprehensive Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, presented earlier this year, and his related reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by Daesh, and to highlighting the measures being taken against them in areas such as countering their financing, preventing and disrupting the travel of foreign terrorist fighters, countering recruitment and preventing violent extremism.</p><p>Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Council I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  I have also emphasised the need to ensure a joined-up approach in relation to the discussions of Foreign Ministers and those of our Justice and Home Affairs counterparts.</p><p>Increasing the effectiveness of information and intelligence-sharing and enhancing border security have been priority themes at recent meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council.  A series of measures is being rolled out to strengthen cooperation and to develop the EU's legal framework for information-sharing, combatting terrorism and controlling illegal firearms.  Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Obviously it arises particularly in the wake of the outcome of the UK referendum in June.  Of course, I am well aware that, in individual Member States, there are those who would wish to leave the Union.  However, this is not the position of any other Government or Parliament. </p><p>The European Union engages with the big issues of the day, whether they relate to stability, jobs and growth, or to challenges external and internal, such as migration and international terrorism.  It is important to continue to engage with these issues at the EU level if we are serious about addressing them.  They cannot be addressed at national level. </p><p>As the leaders of 27 Member States agreed on 29 June, &ldquo;The EU is a historic achievement of peace, prosperity and security on the European continent and remains our common framework.  At the same time many people express dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, be it at the European or national level.  Europeans expect us to do better when it comes to providing security, jobs and growth, as well as hope for a better future.&rdquo; </p><p>At the Summit which followed in Bratislava on 16 September, the leaders issued a Declaration and Roadmap in which they committed to a range of objectives and concrete measures along three themes: migration and external borders; internal and external security; and economic and social development, youth.  The &ldquo;Bratislava process&rdquo; is due to conclude in March 2017 to coincide with the 60<sup>th</sup>anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.  </p><p>The Government will participate actively in this process, maintaining our particular stress on economic issues, and aiming to put the citizen at the heart of the EU agenda for sustainable investment, competitiveness, growth and jobs.  </p></reply>

In the past two weeks alone, migration has been discussed at the European Council, the Foreign Affairs Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  </p><p>The European Union has responded to the crisis by adopting a range of measures including engaging with countries of origin and transit through high level dialogues to address the root causes of migration; agreeing a plan to relocate asylum seekers in Italy and Greece across the EU; an extensive package of measures with Turkey under the EU Turkey Statement, including the Turkey Refugee Facility worth &euro;3 billion; an EU-Africa Trust Fund to address migration from Africa; and EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia, the naval mission in the Mediterranean to prevent loss of life at sea.  </p><p>At UN level too the migration crisis has been the focus of two summits held in New York last month.  Ireland and Jordan were appointed to co-facilitate negotiations on the arrangements for a UN Summit to address large movements of refugees and migrants, with the aim of bringing countries together behind a more humane and co-ordinated approach to this issue.  The Summit outcome, successfully negotiated under the leadership of Ireland and Jordan, clearly reaffirms the centrality of the legal and normative framework that already exists and commits the Member States of the UN to its implementation.  It acknowledges <i>inter alia</i>that not enough has been done to reduce the need for people to flee in the first place and that responsibility for protecting and assisting refugees is not being shared fairly.</p><p>The outcome document also sets out a detailed &ldquo;comprehensive refugee response framework&rdquo; and launches an informal consultation process, to be convened by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which will culminate in a Global Compact on Refugees in 2018. It further sets out arrangements for the negotiation of a Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, also to be adopted in 2018.</p><p>The second Summit - on Refugees - was hosted by President Obama on 20 September. It led to commitments by the 52 countries and international organisations participating (including Ireland) to increase their total 2016 financial contributions to UN appeals and international humanitarian organisations by approximately $4.5 billion above 2015 levels.</p></reply>

They play crucial roles in supporting Irish businesses to grow overseas, in promoting our wider trade interests including through EU and WTO regulation; in addressing market access issues; in underpinning the work of our State agencies and in supporting Ministerial visits and trade missions. </p>  <p>  In the evolving global economic and trading environment, and against the backdrop of the British vote to leave the EU, it is essential that our mission network is equipped to adapt and evolves to meet new challenges and exploit new opportunities for Irish trade.  We also need to ensure that the network continues to be appropriately equipped and resourced to support Ireland's economic objectives overseas. </p>  <p>  It is increasingly important that our work both at HQ and abroad is strategically focused and closely co-ordinated as a whole-of-government exercise.  Guided by the Government's Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, launched in 2010 and reviewed in 2014, new Embassies have been opened since 2014 in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia) as well as Consulates-General in Hong Kong (China), Austin (Texas, USA) and Sao Paulo (Brazil).  The opening of these new Embassies and Consulates has strengthened Ireland's capacity to take advantage of emerging market opportunities. </p>  <p>  With a view to further augmenting the economic work of my Department and our Embassy network, I launched a new Economic Diplomacy Strategy in January 2016.  A central element of the Strategy is the establishment of a network of locally-hired Commercial Attach&eacute;s to extend the range and impact of our embassies' trade activities.  Locally hired Commercial Attach&eacute;s are being appointed initially on a pilot basis in our embassies in Mexico, Brasilia, Buenos Aires, Bucharest, and Jakarta and consideration will be given to the potential for similar appointments in other locations in the future.  In addition, provision has already been made for the appointment of an Economic Development Officer (EDO) in Abuja, funded from the Irish Aid budget, whose role is analogous to that of a Commercial Attach&eacute;. </p>  <p>  Within the context of our already very successful Local Market Teams in key markets, this initiative will equip Embassies to open additional business links and networks for Ireland's exporters, complementing and aligning with the work undertaken by the State agencies and their networks overseas.  </p>  <p>  All efforts by Embassies and Local Market Teams abroad to take advantage of new opportunities for Irish business in key markets will continue to be guided here at home by the work of the Trade Division within my Department and by the Export Trade Council, which I chair. The Export Trade Council met most recently on 18 October when there was a particular focus on the Asia Pacific region. Total exports of goods and services from Ireland to the Asia Pacific region exceeded &euro;20 billion in 2014 and there is great potential for future growth in exports and investment links.  The Programme for Partnership Government mandated whole-of-Government cross-sectoral strategies for the Asia Pacific and Americas regions. Work on the formulation of these strategies is well underway.  </p>  <p>  Work is also in hand, in partnership with the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and other stakeholders, on accelerating the formulation of the successor policy to the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy.</p></reply>

Our Embassies and Consulates take every opportunity to promote Irish business abroad, conscious that trade is a key driver of the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Ireland's merchandise trade continues to grow.  Last year it reached more than &euro;182 billion, the highest figure ever.  The European Union is our largest trading partner, accounting for about 56% of total trade, of which the UK last year accounted for 26% of exports and 44% of imports; Germany 13% of exports and 14% of imports; and Belgium 24% of exports and 3% of imports.  And trade with the EU is growing.  Last year, the value of total trade (imports and exports) with the EU reached more than &euro;101 billion.   </p>  <p>  Ireland's services exports and imports to EU countries have also grown significantly in recent years.  There was a slight decline in the value of services exports and imports immediately following 2008, but subsequent years have shown growth, particularly in services exports.  Services exports to the EU-27 grew by 13% between 2013 and 2014, exceeding growth in services exports to North America, Africa and Asia. </p>  <p>  Other major trade partners are the United States (23 percent of exports and 12 percent of imports) and China.  Trade with NAFTA countries (US, Canada and Mexico) has been growing strongly over the past decade with the value of imports and exports combined up approximately 61%.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am determined to lead the Government's efforts to diversify and open up our exports globally.  This is critical to Ireland's economic success, but takes on a renewed importance in light of the UK's decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  Last week, I chaired the 13th meeting of the Export Trade Council, which focussed in particular on the high potential of the Asia Pacific region. We also discussed the challenges and opportunities for Irish export trade following the UK decision to leave the European Union</p></reply>

I have also met with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on a number of occasions and have been meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.  On all occasions, I and my ministerial colleagues have emphasised Ireland's key priorities around Northern Ireland, the border arrangements, the Common Travel area and the importance of economic, trade and people-to-people relations. I have also emphasised Ireland's ongoing commitment to a strong EU characterised by partnership, peace and prosperity.   </p>  <p>  These contacts form part of a pattern of engagement with UK and EU counterparts across government, led by the Taoiseach.

In July, a serious outbreak of fighting between Government and Opposition forces resulted in the deaths of at least 300 people, including two UN peacekeeping troops.</p>  <p>  Following the violence in July, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions South Sudan on 18 July.  The Council condemned in the strongest terms the attacks on civilians, UN compounds, diplomatic officials and aid workers arising from the widespread violence.  The Council Conclusions urged the Government of South Sudan to respect international humanitarian law, and noted that the South Sudanese population had suffered grave abuses, including gender based violence and forced displacement.  The Council also commended all neighbouring countries for keeping borders open and hosting South Sudanese refuges, which are now estimated to number over 1 million. </p>  <p>  High Representative Federica Mogherini released a statement on behalf of the European Union on 20 September, reiterating the call for the South Sudanese Government to establish the Hybrid Court for South Sudan, as detailed in the Agreement for the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan, which was agreed by both sides to the civil war in August 2015.  The statement also called for the opening of an investigation into all crimes committed during the outbreak of violence in July.</p>  <p>  The EU is also among the most generous donors of humanitarian assistance in South Sudan, providing over 40% of all humanitarian aid directed to the crisis in 2016.</p>  <p>  Ireland also maintains a strong focus on South Sudan through targeted humanitarian assistance, interventions at the Human Rights Council, and engagement at EU level informed by ongoing monitoring by our Embassy in Addis Ababa.</p>  <p>  Since the outbreak of the conflict in December 2013, Ireland has provided &euro;28 million in humanitarian assistance through our UN, Red Cross and NGO partners on the ground.  This year, Ireland has provided &euro;8.5 million in humanitarian assistance for food and livelihood assistance, treating acute malnutrition, providing shelter and protection, and providing emergency services in health care, water and sanitation and education for the most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  Ireland intervened on South Sudan at the Human Rights Council in June 2016. Ireland's statement called on the Transitional Government to respect and protect fundamental human rights, and called for civil society actors, including human rights defenders, to be enabled to exercise their rights free from violence, arrest and intimidation.  We also supported calls for the formation of a Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, and encouraged the Commission to pursue recommendations on how transitional justice, accountability and reconciliation could be delivered.</p></reply>

The activities of the group continue to pose a serious risk to the peace and security of Nigeria and the wider region, including Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</p>  <p>  In a UN report released in June of this year, UN human rights experts found that Boko Haram have subjected women and children to extensive practices of abduction, rape, forced marriage, and forcing children in to direct and supporting combat roles.  There is also a serious developing trend of forcing young girls to engage in suicide bombings.</p>  <p>  While exact numbers of those abducted is difficult to confirm, the UN estimates that thousands of women and children have been abducted by Boko Haram since 2012.  As of February 2016, 1,010 of these children had been rescued. Ireland, with our EU partners, continues to call for all parties to work together in securing the release of those that have been abducted. </p>  <p>  In particular, Ireland has consistently called for the release of the Chibok Schoolgirls, who were abducted in April 2014.  In that regard, I welcome the recent news of the release of 21 of the girls and join with my EU colleagues in congratulating Nigeria on the success of the negotiations.  I also commend Switzerland and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for their important role in facilitating this process. The release has brought the total number of the Chibok Schoolgirls freed in 2016 to 22.</p>  <p>  While it is the responsibility of the Nigerian Government to ensure that a secure environment is provided to its citizens, Ireland, in cooperation with our EU partners, has continued to support the Nigerian Government in its efforts.  The EU has pledged to provide up to &euro;50 million to the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which comprises 8,700 troops from neighbouring countries and the Nigerian Armed Forces, to promote regional security. </p>  <p>  More recently, as the security situation has improved with gains by the Nigerian Armed Forces against Boko Haram, the true extent of the crisis has been revealed, with an estimated 7 million people now in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to provide significant humanitarian funding in areas affected by the conflict.  To date in 2016, Ireland has provided over &euro;721,000 in stocks and &euro;300,000 in humanitarian grants to NGOs for use in the region.  Furthermore, in September 2016, my Department announced funding of &euro;1 million each to both the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Committee of the Red Cross, for use in North East Nigeria. Additionally, Ireland has in the last year deployed five Rapid Response personnel to Maiduguri for three months to work in logistics, gender, coordination and engineering.</p></reply>

These reviews have commended our aid distribution to Sub-Saharan Africa and other areas of greatest need.  The percentage of Ireland's ODA allocated to Least Developed Countries, is amongst the highest of OECD donors.</p><p>Ireland's Policy for International Development, <i>One World One Future,</i>has a strong focus on the most vulnerable and poorest communities.  A high standard of monitoring the policy's implementation by Irish Aid and all its partners is ensured through the use of a detailed framework which sets out clear objectives, targets and a monitoring mechanism.</p><p>Accountability and transparency are central to maintaining high standards in the implementation of the aid programme.  Full details of the distribution of our aid are published each year in our Annual Report.  These reports clearly show the distribution of aid, including the amounts given to countries in Africa and elsewhere, and the amounts allocated to different priorities and to different partners.  They function as a core accountability and transparency tool, providing a comprehensive overview of expenditure under the aid programme, and demonstrating the results that have been achieved.  The latest Annual Report, for 2015, and other details on the aid programme, are accessible on the Irish Aid website, .</p><p>All programmes being considered for funding assistance are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff against clear criteria, including efficiency in the use of resources, and the capacity of the implementing organisations to deliver results and account for resources received.  Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended results are being achieved and resources have been used appropriately.  This monitoring is undertaken by a combination of specialist staff, Embassy-based internal auditors, independent experts, and the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That Unit's work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of this Department.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General provides independent assurance that Official Development Assistance is being provided in accordance with the law, is managed to good effect, and is properly accounted for.</p><p>Monitoring the distribution and quality of our aid programme and exercising full accountability and transparency for results achieved and resources utilised, are vital in the fight against hunger and poverty.  These are principles the Irish Aid will continue to keep at the heart of our programme.</p></reply>

In addition, the Council received the final report of the Commission of Inquiry on Eritrea, and established a Commission on Human Rights on South Sudan.  These Commissions are designed to investigate human rights abuses in the countries concerned; and to identify specific recommendations to address the situation.  The EU also actively engages on human rights issues in the Horn of Africa.  The EU Horn of Africa Regional Action Plan highlights human rights, rule of law and democratic governance as priority issues for EU engagement.  The EU regularly raises human rights concerns in discussions with the governments of the region.</p>  <p>  The EU also provides support to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and to a wide range of human rights NGOs in the region.</p>  <p>  Ireland provides significant development and humanitarian funding to the Horn of Africa region, particularly in Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia. Ireland has also committed to provide &euro;3 million to the Horn of Africa window of the EU Trust Fund for Africa for the 2016-2020 period.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor the human rights situation in the Horn of Africa and highlight our concerns bilaterally, through the EU, and in the UN Human Rights Council.</p></reply>

The actions taken include: agreeing EU guidelines on the protection of freedom of religion or belief during our 2013 EU Presidency; co-sponsoring proposed Security Council resolutions on Syria which included provisions to provide legal accountability for the victims of the conflict, including religious minorities; an address last year by the T&aacute;naiste to an international conference of European and Middle Eastern States on protecting the victims of Da'esh terrorism; addressing the UN Security Council on protection of religious minorities in the Middle East.  I have raised the protection of Christians in the Middle East in speeches to the UN.</p>  <p>  Clearly however, much of the persecution of Christians and other minorities taking place now in the Middle East is a direct consequence of the breakdown of law and order, absence of state authority and in some cases open civil war.  We must also recognise that we are limited in terms of possible direct actions, as we have no representation on the ground in Syria and Iraq and no possibility for engagement with groups who fundamentally reject any notion of religious freedom or pluralist societies.</p>  <p>  The only means of securing the protection of Christian communities and other minorities across the Middle East, is through the promotion of sustainable political solutions to the conflicts which have destabilised the region and have been the key factor in the promotion of radical and extremist ideologies.  This is something we have discussed on many occasions here in the House.  Ireland has been a key supporter of the UN's efforts to achieve an end to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and this will continue to a priority in our diplomatic efforts.</p></reply>

This Drainage Scheme was constructed by the Commissioners of Public Works for the benefit of agricultural land in the area.  It was not constructed as a scheme to provide protection for residential properties.  Maintenance of the river channel, where it is part of the Drainage Scheme is the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works and maintenance of the scheme is carried out regularly.  The River Ouvane is included in the OPW's Arterial Drainage Maintenance 2016 Business Programme.

A consultation process in relation to the unit underway and an initial work programme for it has been identified.</p>  <p>  My objective is to establish a Unit which provides added value for prevention and early intervention (PEI) and avoids duplication where strategies and structures are already in place for the development, provision, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of PEI services.</p>  <p>  The consultation undertaken with stakeholders in the early years area has been very informative in shaping the proposed approach to the work of the PEI Unit.  This process of consultation is continuing, with the focus extended to prevention and early intervention issues in the context of older people.</p>  <p>  The PEI Unit's initial work programme will establish the parameters for the PEI services within the scope of the Unit.  This will also involve identifying the resources and evaluation processes associated with these services.  This will be undertaken on a cross-departmental basis, within the current programme budgeting framework and the public spending code.  Inter-departmental/agency consultation will be required, and, in this context, the work of the Unit will complement and draw on existing processes, in particular, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' whole of government 'Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People' and similarly the Department of Health's cross departmental 'National Positive Ageing Strategy'.</p>  <p>  This approach, I believe, will have a positive impact on the evaluation process in the PEI area, together with availability of information and levels of accountability.</p></reply>

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.</p>  <p>  The most recent EU Directive on Public Procurement (Directive 2014/24/EU) indicates that proof of the economic operator's economic and financial standing may, as a general rule, be furnished by one or more of the following references:</p>  <p>  - appropriate statements from banks or, where appropriate, evidence of relevant professional risk indemnity insurance; </p>  <p>  - the presentation of financial statements or extracts from the financial statements, where publication of financial statements is required under the law of the country in which the economic operator is established;</p>  <p>  - a statement of the undertaking's overall turnover and, where appropriate, of turnover in the area covered by the contract for a maximum of the last three financial years available, depending on the date on which the undertaking was set up or the economic operator started trading, as far as the information on these turnovers is available.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the above list is not exhaustive.</p>  <p>  The Directive also states that where, for any valid reason, the economic operator is unable to provide the references requested by the contracting authority, it may prove its economic and financial standing by any other document which the contracting authority considers appropriate.  This provision allows contracting authorities a degree of flexibility in relation to the type of proof of financial capacity it accepts from potential tenderers.</p>  <p>  It recognises that there can be genuine reasons why a firm has difficulty in providing a particular type of evidence requested (e.g. a recently established business will not be in a position to provide evidence of two or three years' turnover) or why the data might not be reflective of its underlying operational situation (e.g. early start-up costs may reflect disproportionately in a new firm's balance sheet or profit and loss account).  In these situations contracting authorities may consider alternative means of satisfying themselves about whether or not there is a genuine financial risk should the company turn out to be a winning tenderer.  Procurement rules allow for example for the acceptance of guarantees or undertaking by a parent company or other third party.</p>  <p>  Government Policy, as set out in Circular 10/14: Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement issued by my Department, is aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the circular stresses that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them should be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.  The Office of Government Procurement through its engagement with public bodies and SME representative bodies is ensuring that this message continues to be highlighted.</p></reply>

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.  Therefore, there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements must logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p>  <p>  However, the Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs.  In this regard, Government Policy, as set out in Circular 10/14: Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement issued by my Department, is aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the circular stresses that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them should be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract and, a matter of general policy, should not for routine goods and services competitions set company turnover requirements at more than twice the estimated contract value.

This means that persons retiring since 1 July 2013 from grades affected by the pay cuts on that date were awarded, and are paid, pensions based on the higher "pre-cut" salaries; in like manner, the pensions of equivalent earlier retirees, who retired before 1 July 2013, are unaffected by those 2013 pay cuts.  I should also point out that neither of the two direct salary reductions in the public service under the FEMPI legislation, occurring in 2010 and 2013, or the reduction effected under the FEMPI 2009 Act through the imposition of the Pension Related Deduction on remuneration of public servants were passed on to the pensions of same-grade retirees.</p>  <p>  Public service pensioners have been impacted by another FEMPI measure, the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR). The PSPR reduces the pay-out value of pensions with pre-PSPR values above specified thresholds in a progressively structured way which has a proportionately greater effect on higher value pensions.  At all times, public service pensions up to a value of &euro;12,000 have been unaffected by PSPR, while a higher exemption threshold of &euro;32,500 has applied to pensions awarded from 1 March 2012 onwards.</p>  <p>  PSPR is being significantly reversed in three stages under FEMPI 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, the changes will mean that all public service pensions with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  As we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR restoration towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service, the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages will be considered by Government.</p></reply>

The overall objective of the Strategy is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  The Strategy is a cross cutting area of public policy and service delivery which requires a coordinated response by Government Departments and Agencies, in conjunction with the Community and Voluntary Sectors, to tackle the drugs problem.  </p>  <p>  The overall expenditure on drugs programmes by Government Departments and Agencies in 2015 came to &euro;238.5m, of which about  &euro;120m related to services operated by the HSE and by the Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. Each Task Force has an allocation for community-based drugs initiatives set up to tackle the drugs problem under each pillar of the Strategy, including education and prevention programmes which aim to promote healthier lifestyle choices among young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of problem drug use. </p>  <p>  Substance use education in schools is provided in the context of Social Personal and Health Education.  The Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate continues to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of substance use policies in schools through the whole-school evaluation process and the inspectorate system.  In addition, significant investment has been made in the Garda Youth Diversion Programme to divert at risk young people from becoming involved in criminal behaviour, including drug related crime, and preventing their succumbing to drug misuse.</p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that the most recently published data regarding illegal drug use is contained in the 2010/11 Drug Prevalence Survey.  The results of this survey provide details of prevalence of drug use by age, gender and regional drug and alcohol Task Force areas.  It is anticipated that the results of the 2014/15 drug prevalence survey will be published by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Hospital Groups must increasingly focus on networks of service provision with smaller hospitals managing routine, urgent or planned care locally, more complex care managed in the larger hospitals and better linkages with primary, continuing and social care.</p>  <p>  A number of developments at the hospital have been funded in recent years including the refurbishment of the Emergency Department and  upgrade of general theatres and Central Sterile Services.  There has also been an increase in day surgical activity, with surgeons from the Mater Misercordiae University Hospital carrying out day surgery in Navan.  Further developments in relation to surgery and other clinical services are being considered by the Group.  There is significant potential for enhancing the hospital's roles as a constituent hospital within the Hospital Group. As a smaller hospital, the challenge is to make sure that Navan provides more of the right type of services, which can safely be delivered, so that we maximise the benefit to patients.  </p>  <p>   In relation to your specific queries raised regarding the Emergency Department, I understand that the Hospital Group CEO  has written to you directly confirming that it is not the intention of the Hospital Group to close  the Emergency Department in January 2017.  Any proposed change to services provided at Navan Hospital, will need to take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Hospital Group.  </p>  <p>  I would be happy to consider a request to meet with  the group referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored. Doctors in training actively participate in the implementation and monitoring of these recommendations through the Forum of Irish Medical Postgraduate Training Bodies Trainee Sub Committee.</p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates. Measures to date  include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.</p>  <p>  This month the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by fourth year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates. This decision means that all nurses and midwives will have incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year. It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.</p>  <p>  The HSE is focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and on replacing agency staff with permanent staff. Recruitment of additional nurses is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals.  Recruitment campaigns are underway in Ireland and abroad with a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 available to nurses who return from overseas. Campaigns include recent and ongoing international, national and local interviewing of General Nurses, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Children's nurses and midwives. </p>  <p>  There was an increase of 3,661 personnel employed in the public health service (101,917 to 105,578) between August 2015 and August 2016. The total budget for the health service in 2017 is &euro;14.6 billion, the highest budget ever allocated to the health service and this will allow for recruitment of additional frontline staff. </p></reply>

The policy acknowledges that obesity prevention services in the community as well as specialist hospital services will need to be strengthened.  A key element is the appointment of a Clinical Lead for Obesity in the HSE.  The allocation of increased funding to Health and Well-being in the HSE will reflect that Obesity is a priority for the health services and included in the HSE service plan for 2017.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they may face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p><p>It should be noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  </p><p>Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p><p>It is important that people with medical needs are able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 110,453 as of 1 September this year.  This followed the measures announced by my predecessor Minister Varadkar, when the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>was published.  The &quot;Keane&quot; Report found that it is not feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  On foot of the publication of the report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and demonstrates the HSE's commitment to the development of a medical system which is responsive and considerate  of an applicant's particular circumstances.</p></reply>

Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available. </p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process. </p>  <p>  At the request of the HSE, the NCPE is currently conducting an assessment of Vimizim for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis, type IVa (also known as Morquio A syndrome) in patients of all ages.  The NCPE completes all phamacoeconomic evaluations within the 180 day timeline set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The Act allows for stop clocks where companies are required to provide additional data.  Once this assessment is completed, a summary report will be published on the NCPE website.  The HSE will then consider the NCPE assessment as part of its decision-making process when considering the drug for reimbursement. </p>  <p>  As the NCPE's assessment of Vimizim is ongoing, it is not possible to provide further details at this time.</p></reply>

These beds will continue to be very much needed over the coming years as the number of older people increases in line with demographic trends.  It is therefore essential that they are put on a sustainable footing and that the fabric of the buildings from which they operate is modernised and improved. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme announced earlier this year provides for the replacement and refurbishment of public nursing homes across the country over the next five years.  Significant work was undertaken by the HSE in determining the most appropriate scheduling of projects over the 5 year period from 2016 to 2021, within the phased provision of funding, to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.</p>  <p>  Under this Capital Programme it is proposed to deliver a 130 bed unit at Letterkenny to replace the 3 units referred to by the Deputy in Donegal. All healthcare infrastructure developments, including this development, must comply with relevant Public Sector Guidelines and EU Directives and will require a lead-in time to complete the various stages.  This includes appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, detailed design, and finalisation of financing and review of costing estimates.  </p>  <p>  There has been no proposal to close any of the units in question. However, they may not be suitable for upgrading to the Standards required by HIQA for long stay residential care.  Given the requirement for additional services to provide for the needs for older persons right around the country, including Donegal, there will, in parallel with residential beds, be an on-going need for the provision of short stay services, such as rehabilitation, respite, step up, step down facilities, all with a view of maintaining older people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  It is in the context of this planning for the coming years that the future use and purpose of the current buildings in Ramelton, Lifford and Stranorlar will be considered in order to ensure that an appropriate service is provided for the older people living in their own community in Donegal.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community. Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>'Transforming Lives'</i>, the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions. I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation. Earlier this year, I announced that we are providing &euro;100 million in capital funding from now until 2021 in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions  identified by the HSE. This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. </p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is providing &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016. The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative. &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department ofHousing, Planning, Community and Local Government in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community. This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  </p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period.</p><p>- Strand 1- is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;</p><p>- Strand 2- is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and</p><p>- Strand 3- is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p><p>This process of moving people to more suitable accommodation in the community will take place over a number of years, and will be done in full consultation with all residents and their families.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;</i>, I have arranged for the questions regarding Co. Louth to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;40m (including &euro;10m as part of the forthcoming Winter initiative)  already provided in 2016 represented an increase of over 13% in the total funding available, and means that the number of Home Care Packages provided this year will increase from 15,450 to 15,800 and home help hours from 10.4 million to 10.57 million.</p>  <p>  The Winter Initiative will also provide another &euro;1.4m for homecare this year which will provide a further 650 Packages by year's end. These will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals to allow people to be discharged home quickly.

The Act sets out the primary and community health services made available, free of charge, to qualifying women. The health services included in the legislation are: a general practitioner service; prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; home nursing; home support; chiropody; physiotherapy; and counselling services. In addition, the prescription fee is not be payable for all medicines, medical devices or other medical products that are reimbursed by the community drug schemes. A specific card has been issued to the qualifying women so that they can access the health services they require without charge, as set out in the Act. </p>  <p>  There are no proposals at present to extend automatic eligibility to other victims of institutional abuse.</p>  <p>  However, where there are people with medical needs it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 110,453 as of 1 September this year. </p></reply>

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school.  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and there are approximately 70 deaths per year.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. I want to provide assurances to these young women and their families that they are eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. The HSE are currently developing a care pathway for young people who are experiencing these types of symptoms and will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services tailored to the needs of each individual.</p>  <p>  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the same time that they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition.</p>  <p>  The vaccine used in the school immunisation programme is Gardasil and over 220,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.  Gardasil is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.</p>  <p>  While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the Health Products Regulatory Authority participated, focused on two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the EMA stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information which is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue referred to by the Deputy it concerns a complaint made by the Nordic Cochrane Centre concerning the EMA.  The EMA is a decentralised agency of the European Union (EU) responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any complaint made by a third party concerning an EU agency. </p>  <p>  Health care professionals are advised to continue using HPV vaccines in accordance with the current product information and I would encourage all young women to receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

There will be two changes made to the programme with the introduction of Meningitis B and Rotavirus.  Negotiations with the IMO concerning the administration fee are ongoing and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on them at this stage.  It is still planned to introduce immunisation against Meningitis B and Rotavirus for all children born on, or after, 1 October 2016.  The HSE is currently working on the necessary preparations for the introduction of these new vaccines.

There have been significant  developments in the general practice service recently, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional support provided by the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  The HSE, Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs. To date, agreements have been reached in relation to universal GP care without fees for all children under the age of 6 years, universal GP care without fees for all people aged 70 years and over, a specific Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult patients with Type 2 diabetes who hold a medical card or GP visit card, a new Rural Practice Support Framework and a revised list of special items of service that can be provided by GPs.  Preparations for the next phase of the discussions on other aspects of a new contract are under way and I expect that further engagement with GP representative bodies will take place this year.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to extend in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, free GP care to under-18s. This is one of the matters to be discussed in the forthcoming contractual discussions with GP representatives. The extensions of GP care without fees to children aged 6-11 years is a priority for me.  While my wish is that this would happen as soon as possible, the timetable is subject to the outcome of discussions with GP representatives on this and other contractual matters.</p></reply>

Any revision of these medical card income thresholds requires primary legislation.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the means-tested medical card scheme if they so wish, for example in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs. This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses. The qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over-70s gross income thresholds. In setting the assessment guidelines, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has regard to Government policy as outlined by the Minister for Health, changes in the consumer price index and other issues which may be relevant. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging GP services as a result of medical or social circumstances. In addition, from August 2015, all persons aged 70 or older qualify for a GP Visit Card, regardless of income.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the increase in the State pension takes effect from March 2017. In the meantime, I have asked my Department to consider with the HSE the impact, if any, which this increase may have on people's ability to qualify for a medical card under the gross income threshold arrangements. It would be the Government's intention that people would not be adversely affected.</p></reply>

During processing of this application a dual claim error arose in respect of 1 of the parcels declared. In response to a query letter issued by my Department, the person named confirmed she did not have the right to declare this land. As a result, 1.27ha of the land declared remained eligible under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  These 1.27 entitlements had a value of less than &euro;100. In line with the relevant EU rules, payment was not made in 2013 where the amount due was less than &euro;100. In order to qualify for an allocation right under the Basic Payment Scheme, farmers must have received a Single Payment of a minimum value of &euro;100 in 2013. This criteria was thus not met in this case.</p></reply>

Considerable funding has been set aside for this over the course of the RDP period. There is also a separate fund for bottom-up projects, drawn from open competitive calls, and again I would expect that many of these will focus on farmer-led initiatives in designated areas. Finally, I should draw attention to the Burren Programme, which will allow for expansion of the scheme to include all eligible farmers in the Burren region and which focuses specifically on the better management of Annex 1 habitats.</p>  <p>  From a GLAS perspective Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas are given tier 1 priority when selecting applicants under the Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) operated by my Department. The scheme provides significant funding to farmers with designated lands.</p>  <p>  Finally under the provisions of the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), farmers need to declare an eligible hectare for each payment entitlement held in order to benefit from payment. The hectares declared must be eligible and must have an agricultural activity carried out on them. Where an officially approved environmental management plan involving Special Areas of Conservation or Special Protection Areas requires certain management practices to be conducted on agricultural areas, such management practices will take precedence in determining the level of agricultural activity to be conducted on agricultural areas declared for payment. Article 32(2)(b)(i) of Regulation (EU) 1307/2013 provides that an eligible hectare for BPS purposes includes any area which gave a right to payments in 2008 under the single payment scheme and which no longer complies with the definition of 'eligible hectare' as a result of the implementation of Directive 92/43/EEC, Directive 2000/60/EC and Directive 2009/147/EC where the following conditions are met:</p>  <p>  (1) The land must have been claimed under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p>  <p>  (2) The land must have been eligible for payment under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p>  <p>  (3) Any increase in the ineligible area should be directly linked to the   management requirements for the habitat.</p></reply>

The EU Regulations governing the administration of these area based schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative eligibility checks, including in some cases either ground or remote sensing (satellite) inspections, be completed before any payments issue. </p>  <p>  Eligibility checks are required to ensure that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that there are no dual claims of land, and that ineligible land or features are not included for aid purposes. Where ineligible land or features are identified as a result of any of the eligibility checks these areas must be mapped on the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). In addition, where applicants under these schemes submit details of amendments to land being declared, either to add additional land or to exclude ineligible land/features, my Department must process these amendments on the LPIS.</p>  <p>  The processing relating to both applicants requests for amendments and the outcome of the administrative and inspections checks ensures that the LPIS is accurately maintained. The updating of LPIS is a critical element underpinning payments under the Direct Payment Schemes and my Department must ensure, under EU Regulations, that it is accurate and up-to-date. In addition, the eligibility checks are required to protect the annual drawdown of the EU funds and to avoid disallowances. </p>  <p>  At present, advance payments under the BPS have issued to over 113,000 farmers while ANC payments have issued to over 83,000 farmers. Ireland is amongst the first Member States to make advance payments under the BPS and has made such payments each year sine 2006.  </p>  <p>  There is currently no delay in the digitising of maps arising from query cases or eligibility checks other than cases which are the subject of ongoing correspondence between the farmer and my Department.  The completion of all digitising of maps and the clearance of applications for payments remains a key priority for my Department.  Accordingly, regular pay runs are in place for BPS and the ANC scheme to process cases for payments as they become clear.</p>  <p>    </p></reply>

The Agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the INDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States which commits to 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. The specific details of the contribution to be made by each Member State to this overall ambition remains to be finalised, and Ireland is currently examining proposals made by the European Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  As of Monday 24 October 2016, 84 Parties to the Convention (including the EU and ten Member States) accounting in total for 60.99 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval. Therefore in accordance with Article 21 (1) the Agreement will enter into force at the next Conference of the Parties (COP22) which will be held in Marrakesh from 7 to 18 November 2016.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of the Paris Agreement and indicated its continuing commitment by signing the Agreement, along with other EU member states, at the signing ceremony in New York on 22nd April this year. Ireland began its domestic ratification process on 18 October with the agreement of Government to seek the approval of Dail Eireann for Ireland to ratify the agreement. The Paris Agreement has since been laid before the Dail and will be debated on Thursday 27th October with the aim of completing the process prior to COP 22, which takes place in Marrakesh from 7 to 18 November 2016.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable energy sources, with the latter target also being legally binding.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. In 2015, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that 25.3% of electricity was generated by renewable sources, of which 22.8% was generated by onshore wind. </font></p><p>In addition to our onshore wind resource, bioenergy, solar, offshore wind and other technologies may play a critical role in diversifying our renewable generation portfolio over the period to 2030. The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out Government policy in relation to the sustainable development of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). In-depth economic analysis is underway to inform the actual cost of a new scheme and, while no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of solar photovoltaic (PV), bio-energy and offshore wind are being examined as part of the assessment process. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">While I am aware that there have been some recent competitive bids for offshore wind in other EU members states which is to be welcomed, it would be important to understand whether this is a one-off phenomenon or indicative of an underlying trend. If it is the latter, and the price continues to fall, then the Deputy will appreciate it is vitally important that if a support tariff is to be offered for offshore wind it is struck at a level that is competitive and minimises the cost to consumers.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Once the detailed economic analysis is complete, there will be an additional public consultation phase on the design of the new scheme. The details of this will be advertised on the Department's website </font><i>www.dccae.gov.ie.</i><font color="#0D0D0D">The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission. </font></p><p>The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions set out in the White Paper on Energy Policy and Programme for Government that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available ate extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Longford. Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode. The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to broadband@dcenr.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  Over 11,000 premises in County Longford are within the AMBER area and will be covered by the State Intervention including the townland of Abbeyschrule, and will therefore be included in the procurement process.</p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been approximately 150 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  </p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. </p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

More vehicles were grant aided in 2015 under the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme, which provides grants towards the purchase of new EVs, than in the previous four years of the scheme combined.  The figure of 555 EVs supported in 2015 has already been surpassed this year with 572  vehicles grant aided to date in 2016.</p></reply>

The governance framework that applies to the all-island electricity market remains in place and is based on national legislation adopted by the Oireachtas and the British Parliament. The Regulator-led Integrated Single Electricity Market or I-SEM project is amending the technical trading rules of the market and is scheduled to be in place by the end of 2017. This project does not affect the existing legislative and governance structures of the SEM.

Under current road traffic regulations it is the responsibility of vehicle owners to ensure that both the towing vehicle and trailer are mechanically sound, fit for purpose, and compliant with road traffic legislation.</p>  <p>  The categories of vehicles subject to roadworthiness testing and the frequency of such tests are governed by EC Directive 2009/40/EC on the roadworthiness testing of motor vehicles and their trailers. Under this Directive, category O1 and O2 trailers (with a DGVW of between 750kg to 3,500kg) are exempt from annual roadworthiness testing. However, since October 2012, O1 and O2 trailers must be type approved before they are sold thus ensuring that they are manufactured to a recognised and approved safety standard.</p>  <p>  Heavy category O3 and O4 trailers (DGVW from 3,500kg to in excess of 10,000kg) are subject to Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Testing (CVRT). The CVRT is only one component of the preventative measures required to ensure safer vehicles on our roads. To ensure that vehicles are kept in a safe and roadworthy condition throughout their lifetime it is essential that they are regularly maintained and serviced in line with manufacturers guidelines. Commercial vehicle operators are statutorily obliged to have appropriate maintenance and repair systems in place, conduct daily walk around checks of their vehicles and to make an annual declaration on their maintenance to the Road Safety Authority.</p></reply>

The requirements to be met in order to be considered medically fit to drive are set at EU rather than national level.  Because of the inevitable risk of deterioration in health, including eyesight, due to aging, people renewing their driving licences after the age of 70 are required to undergo both medical and eyesight tests.  It is long-standing practice in this and other jurisdictions to require medical tests for fitness to drive for older driver licence applicants.  It is obviously important that such tests are carried out independently and by medical professionals.  This is done in the interests of road safety, both of the applicants and other road users.  Unfortunately, the cost of the medical report is a matter for the medical profession, and thus does not come within my remit to control.</p></reply>

Article 29.8 which states that the State may exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law, does not appear to be relevant in the context of CETA.  </p>  <p>  CETA is an international agreement that will not be part of the domestic law of the State.  Notwithstanding this, the Constitution sets down a number of substantial and procedural requirements that must be strictly followed whenever an international agreement is being concluded.  In accordance with Article 29.4.1 of the Constitution, the conclusion of CETA is an exercise of the executive power of the State in connection with its external relations and is therefore concluded by, or on the authority of the Government.  </p>  <p>  Article 29.5.1 provides that every international agreement to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before D&aacute;il Eireann.  Article 29.5.2 provides that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by D&aacute;il Eireann.  CETA is an international agreement between Canada, the EU and the EU Member States.  Consequently, the provisions of Article 29.5 of the Constitution apply to CETA.  Article 29.5 does not provide any role for Seanad Eireann in this process.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Council Decision provides that the provisions in CETA in relation to investment protection and investment dispute resolution will be excluded from provisional application.  However upon full entry into force, involving the approval of all 28 Member States, CETA provides for the establishment of a permanent Tribunal of fifteen Members to hear claims for violation of the investment protection standards established in the Agreement.  The operation of this Tribunal could give rise to a possible charge on public funds as part of the EU Budget.</p></reply>

In addition, the Workplace Relations Act 2015 introduced provisions on Fixed Payment Notices and Compliance Notices covering certain breaches of legislation, including breaches of certain sections of the above-mentioned 1991 and 2000 Acts.</p>  <p>  There are a range of provisions which can apply in circumstances where the appropriate wages have not been made to an employee.  For example, an employee can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) under the 1991 Act for the hearing of a case by a WRC Adjudication Officer who can award compensation for the non-payment of wages.  A WRC Inspector can also issue a Compliance Notice where an employer has failed to pay the appropriate wages under the 1991 Act, and non-compliance with the Compliance Notice is an offence.</p>  <p>  An individual who considers that they are not being paid in accordance with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 may refer the matter to a WRC Inspector for investigation or, alternatively, may refer a complaint to the WRC for adjudication by an Adjudication Officer and the awarding of redress.  The 2000 Act also provides for a number of criminal offences, ranging from the failure to pay the statutory rate to the obstruction of Inspectors in the exercise of their functions.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has more specific questions or has a particular case in mind, I would refer her to the WRC who are mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  The WRC's Customer Service Section provides information to both employers and employees in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations.  The WRC's Customer Service Section can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059-9178990.  The website www.workplacerelations.ie also provides extensive information on employment rights.</p></reply>

I would point out to the Deputy that arising from these budgetary discussions, a gross total of &euro;858million in funding was secured for use by my Department in 2017.  This represents an increase of &euro;58million (i.e. 7%) on the &euro;800m funding allocated to my Department in Budget 2016.

This attendance snapshot window of 4 weeks is an expansion on the one week permitted in previous years.  The CCS eligibility window of 12th September 2016 to 14th October 2016 was announced on the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP) homepage at the time of the launch of the programme for the 2016/17 year.  </p>  <p>  My Department will contact the Department of Social Protection after the registrations deadline for their assistance with supplying allowance details against the PPSNs supplied in relation to the CCS eligibility timeframe.  The PPSNs will also be verified through the Health Service Executive (HSE) database in relation to medical cards and GP Visit cards (6 yrs +).  When the Bands have been assigned and approved on the PIP system, the parents, through their childcare service providers, will have a further 4 weeks in which to appeal their Band decision.  Therefore a parent or child, who had been approved for a medical card during the eligibility window, but had not physical proof of same, still has time in which to make an appeal.</p>  <p>  With regard to the differences in the operation of the CCS programme between the community and private childcare providers, I wish to clarify that the private providers with a Community Childcare Subvention (Private) contract are paid only for the attendance of a child based on their CCS eligibility and may obtain 2 weeks payment if no notice is given for a child leaving their service.  However, on the other hand, the community providers running the CCS programme are informed of their annual CCS allocation based on the verification process, which may or may not increase following appeals.  The childcare service may then organise their financial planning for the year.  Their CCS funding for the year may only decrease if the service manager releases the CCS funding if a child leaves or if they choose to close earlier in the year than planned.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to add that the Department is currently looking at the possibility of providing more flexibility for community childcare providers with regard to the submission of registrations under the CCS programme in advance of the introduction of the Single Affordable Childcare Programme which should allow for rolling registrations.</p></reply>

The Committee has an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. </p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published on 8th October, 2015.  The strategy sets out Government's aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People's Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People's Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. </p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include, the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. </p>  <p>  I intend that the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee will be kept under consideration in the light of these developments and in relation the implementation arrangements in place to achieve our national strategies' objectives to secure the best possible outcomes for young people.</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;51m for current expenditure is available from my Department in 2016 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  It is estimated that the voluntary youth services involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people's lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review over the coming years.  My Department has embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed socio-demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  It is my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services. </p></reply>

While operational responsibility for these do not fall within my policy remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I support the extension of parental leave for parents; particularly in the crucial first year.  The Government has provided additional support for stay-at-home parents through the home carer tax credit, which has been increased to &euro;1,100 per year.  I support an increase in the earnings threshold for this, and have raised this with the Minister for Finance. </p><p>  My Department provides a number of childcare schemes available to all families, including the ECCE free pre-school year, which has been extended into a second year from this September - children's eligibility for ECCE has increased from 38 weeks for all children, to an average of 61 weeks (ranging from 51 to 88 weeks depending on date of birth and age starting school).  The Department projects that the expanded ECCE scheme will have a peak enrolment of 127,000 children in the April-June session in 2017.  This is an increase of 60,000 children from the pre-expansion volume.  Registrations for the September intake are on-going.  Presently, the Department expects up to 89,000 children to take part in ECCE from September 2016.  Over the last number of years, up to 96% of pre-school children have accessed the ECCE Programme, demonstrating both good supply and good take-up across the country.  All children can benefit from the learning and socialisation provided through this scheme.</p></reply>

To provide a pro-rata increase in capitation to pay for ten additional hours of ECCE per week, the weekly capitation payable would increase from &euro;64.50 to &euro;107.50 at the standard rate, and from &euro;75 to &euro;125 at the higher capitation rate.</p>  <p>  The extra annual cost of such a measure, assuming take-up were to remain constant, would be &euro;187.5m. </p>  <p>  However such an increase would also result in significant additional costs that cannot be accurately calculated without further research - for example it would be required to provide a meal for children in care for 5 hours per day.  Significantly also, it would no longer be possible for services to run two ECCE sessions per day, meaning that ECCE capacity would drop substantially.  There would likely be capital costs incurred to construct new facilities to cater for children who can no longer be accommodated in 'afternoon' ECCE sessions in such a scenario.</p>  <p>  At present, the goals of the ECCE free pre-school year can be fully met within a 15 hour weekly schedule.  The extension of this programme on a universal basis, to 25 hours per week is not currently under consideration.  Rather it is intended to focus additional funding on ensuring that lower income families can access affordable childcare. </p></reply>

One of the key policies supporting personnel retention is the opportunity for extensive personal and professional development offered by the Defence Forces through accredited courses, and the unique features of the military environment.  But it is also the case that the extensive professional training they receive makes them very attractive within the private sector. </p>  <p>  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. </p>  <p>  All efforts are currently being directed at recruitment in order to return the Defence Forces to their approved establishment.  This is not without challenge and we cannot be complacent.  However, with the support of the Chief of Staff, I am confident that we shall retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  Additionally, in terms of remuneration, the new Public Service Pay Commission, recently announced by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been tasked with providing objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

It operates in partnership between the Department of Defence and local authorities' through-out Ireland.

The Civil Defence Branch provides policy direction, centralised training, administrative support and guidance and centralised procurement of major items of uniform and equipment in support of local authority Civil Defence efforts.</p>  <p>  At local level, Civil Defence is based in each local authority area under the operational control of the relevant local authority.

This is a longstanding position which was reaffirmed in the White Paper on Defence (2015).  Officials in the Department of Defence have been in contact with Westmeath County Council regarding the issue of accommodation for the Civil Defence Unit.  I also met recently with some volunteers from Westmeath Civil Defence.  I understand the Council are reviewing the situation and in the interim have provided temporary training facilities for Westmeath Civil Defence.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence will continue to engage with the Westmeath County Council in an effort to ensure that appropriate accommodation is provided for the Civil Defence Unit.</p></reply>

Therefore, the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the Barracks cannot be sustained.  As it is planned to dispose of the property, it would not be appropriate to facilitate any further community groups in using the Barracks.  However, in the context of the Barracks' potential future use contributing to the positive development of Mullingar, my Department remains open to viable proposals to these ends.  I would suggest that local groups should engage with Westmeath County Council to explore such opportunities.  Should no viable local proposals emerge in the near future my Department will proceed to dispose of the property by public auction.</p></reply>
