The ten year strategy is a cross-Government approach co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality and provides a roadmap to ensure that people with a disability who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.</p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has been assigned direct responsibility for progress under 20 actions in the CES and shares responsibility for delivery of another 13 actions with other Departments and Agencies.  I would point out that the initial year of the CES was very much a foundation year and involved the completion of a number of key pathfinding reviews and evaluations including the Review of the DACT (Disability Activation) programme, the Review of EmployAbility and the completion of the Survey of Disability Allowance recipients.  The outcomes and learning from these evaluations and the survey data has informed subsequent progress including the development of the Ability programme, the Make Work Pay Report, and the progressive extension of Intreo supports to people with disabilities.</p><p>My Department has compiled 2 tables charting progress against the actions in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy.  One table outlines progress on the recommendations assigned specifically to my department while the other provides a summary of progress where the department has a shared responsibility for an action. </p><p>Examples of progress include:-</p><p>- My Department has progressively rolled out its full Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  This service is being provided across the national network of Intreo Centres.</p><p>- A Benefits of Work Estimator has been developed and is available on MyWelfare.ie and can be accessed through Welfare.ie.</p><p>- A Review of Partial Capacity Benefit has been completed and published and will be progressed in the context of the broader Make Work Pay recommendations (in particular the recommendation on early engagement).</p><p>- The Make Work Pay Report is complete with recommendations directed at DEASP and other agencies.  Some actions have already been implemented while some others are subject to further consultation process for persons with disabilities.</p><p>- A fast track return to Disability Allowance has been implemented following the recommendations of the MWP Report.  Information on how to avail of the fast track return is provided on DEASP website.</p><p>I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Table 1:  Update on CES actions allocated solely to DEASP</b><table><tr><th>Action</th><th>Action Details</th><th>Progress to Date</th></tr><tr><td>1.12</td><td>Enhance process to engage with people with disabilities using results of analysis of existing database of people with disabilities receiving income supports from DSP (to be carried out in 2015), to include outcomes of the DACT Projects and the review of EmployAbility service.</td><td>-  Evaluation of DACT has been completed and published<br /><br />-  Review of Employability has been completed and published<br /><br />-  Survey of a Disability Allowance sample has been completed and published<br /><br />-  Ability Programme developed and launched </td></tr><tr><td>1.13</td><td>Learning from relevant Disability Activation Projects, which addressed the needs of younger people with disabilities and the transition from education into work, will inform policy development.</td><td>-  Evaluation of DACT has been completed and published<br /><br />-  Ability Programme developed.</td></tr><tr><td>2.2</td><td>Implement recommendations from the review of Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)</td><td>-  Revision of WSS Scheme Operational Guidelines completed and implemented<br /><br />-  DSP Staff Development Unit have revised eLearning module to ensure consistency in administration of the scheme</td></tr><tr><td>2.3</td><td>DSP to promote work sampling for a defined period of time through programmes including the EmployAbility Service</td><td>- The EmployAbility work trial programme provides EmployAbility participants with the opportunity to try out a job in the open labour market.</td></tr><tr><td>2.4</td><td>DSP to work proactively with employers to provide work placements.</td><td>-  DSP Employer Engagement promotes workplace supports for people with disabilities on an ongoing basis.<br /><br />-  EmployAbility enables employers to support the progression and retention of people with disabilities and facilitates recruitment while facilitating the development of innovative employment and progression opportunities<br /><br />-  Information pack available for employers on employment of persons with disabilities</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>DSP to explore the idea of expanding internships as a recruitment route for the private sectors.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-19a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061900058#WRA01000"><p>The Department has not recently had specific discussions with representatives of organisations representing persons with sight difficulties on the differences in conditionality attached to blind person&rsquo;s pension (BPP) and disability allowance (DA).  My Department consults regularly on disability related matters with people with disabilities through a number of fora including the Department&rsquo;s Disability Consultative Committee, the &lsquo;Community and Voluntary pillar&rsquo; (regular information sharing meetings held with representatives from a wide range of community and voluntary organisations/sectors), and the Disability Stakeholders Group. Members of these groups may raise issues relevant to their sectoral issues at these fora.</p>  <p>  Blind Pension is a means-tested payment for blind and visually impaired people between the ages of 18 and 66 who are habitually resident in Ireland.  The payment is made up of a personal rate and extra amounts for a qualified adult and any child dependants.     To qualify for the BPP a person must supply an eye test from an ophthalmic surgeon to verify his/her visual impairment.</p>  <p>  I should point out that BPP is a unique scheme in that it is the only social welfare payment which caters for a specific disability.  The scheme was established under the Blind Pension Persons Act of 1920 and in effect predates not only the modern social protection system but also the foundation of the State.</p>  <p>  A review of Disability and Illness Payments by the then Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2003 examined similarities and differences between the schemes and concluded that there should be one single-tested payment for people with disabilities regardless of the nature of the disability.  I understand that at the time following discussions with representative groups, the proposal was not proceeded with.  However, my Department would be open to revisiting this proposal with representative groups as a way of addressing any perceived anomalies.</p>  <p>  Any comparison between the two schemes would have to take into account factors which favour the BPP.  For instance, the awarding of BPP may also qualify a person for the blind welfare allowance paid by the HSE.  There is also a difference in the income disregard for non-rehabilitative employment.  For BPP there is an income disregard of &euro;400 per annum or &euro;7.50 per week.  There is no such disregard for DA for non-rehabilitative employment.</p>  <p>  Against this, the assessment of capital and spousal income are treated differently in the two schemes.  Under the means test for DA, the first &euro;50,000 of capital is disregarded while for BPP (as is the case with the great majority of welfare schemes) the first &euro;20,000 of capital only is disregarded.  Furthermore, In the case of BPP there are no disregards for spousal, civil partner or cohabitant earnings. </p>  <p>  However for other factors, the treatment of conditions is similar.  A person in receipt of BPP or DA can earn &euro;120 per week in rehabilitative earnings before these earnings affect payment.  If a person earns more than &euro;120 per week, 50% of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are not taken into account in the BPP or DA means test.  Earnings over &euro;350 are assessed in full.</p>  <p>  I should point out that a person making an application for BPP will generally be encouraged to ascertain first of all whether they would be better off availing of DA rather than BPP and they may then opt for the more beneficial payment.</p></reply>

This is currently the subject of a public consultation which stays open until the 3<sup>rd</sup>of September.</p><p>Separately, I announced on 23<sup>rd</sup>January an interim TCA for those affected by the 2012 rate-band changes.  Under this approach, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 (i.e. who is among those affected by the new ratebands introduced from that date) and who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.</p><p>Up to 20 years of HomeCaring credits, and / or 10 years of other qualifying credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  This interim TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.</p><p>Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements. Following this, IT solutions must be developed in line with this legislation.

The primary responsibility for provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities.  DEASP&rsquo;s role with regard to people who are homeless is mainly income maintenance.  In recognition of the on-going rental market difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach in the administration of rent supplement in particular when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy due to their landlord seeking rent in excess of the prevailing rent limit.  Over the last twelve months, approximately 1,000 persons have been supported under this approach with an average uplift in excess of the prevailing rent limits of approximately &euro;200 per month.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support, with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, available nationwide from 1 March 2017.  There are currently over 37,000 HAP tenancies in place of which c 9,780 (c.26%) are transfers from rent supplement.  New applicants who have been assessed as having a social housing need are being supported by Local Authorities through HAP rather than rent supplement. </p>  <p>  Department officials at local level are actively engaged with relevant local authorities, Homeless Action Teams, Regional teams and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the necessary supports are provided and cases where a threat of losing a tenancy or potential homelessness are prioritised accordingly.</p></reply>

The rural social scheme (RSS) provides farmers and fishermen with income support while they also make a contribution to their community. As the Deputy is aware T&uacute;s and RSS are delivered and managed at local level through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta , known as Implementing Bodies (IB&rsquo;s) and each of them have been awarded a specific quota of T&uacute;s and RSS participants, based on their ability to source suitable placements.  CE schemes are typically sponsored by groups (known as sponsors) wishing to benefit the local community.  My Department agree participant numbers annually with each CE sponsor organisation who are responsible for the recruitment of participants and to identify suitable work placements. As on 9th June 2018, there were 380 participant vacancies on the rural social scheme (RSS) out of the 3,350 available participant places.</p>  <p>  The CE scheme has a total of 26,542 approved participant places with 4,850 participant vacancies.  The current T&uacute;s participant quota is 8,260 reducing to 6,500 before year end.  As on 9th June 2018, there were approximately 1,849 participant vacancies nationwide.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that given the welcome improvements in the labour market in recent years with reducing numbers of long term unemployed on the Live Register, which is the target cohort for CE and T&uacute;s, it is proving difficult to fill the number of places available nationwide.  To broaden access to these initiatives to a wider range of people, I have introduced a number of changes to the qualifying criteria and since 1st  June I am facilitating persons to take up a placement on CE or T&uacute;s while also attending their JobPath provider.</p>  <p>  My Department have engaged with the Irish Local Development Network (ILDN) &ndash; the representative body for the T&uacute;s IBs to implement the reduction in participant numbers from 8,260 to 6,500 and a revised funding structure.  Given the improved economic and labour market context, I believe that it is entirely appropriate that we examine this area of expenditure to ensure that we deliver best value for the Irish taxpayer and ensure best use is being made of funding in this area.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse/partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.  The capital assessment formula for social assistance schemes is outlined in the following table: <table><tr><th>Amount of capital</th><th>Means assessment </th></tr><tr><td>Initial disregard</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000</td><td>&euro;1 per &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000</td><td>&euro;2 per &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Remaining capital</td><td>&euro;4 per &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>For most social assistance schemes (such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farm assist, carer&rsquo;s allowance, one-parent family payment and the state pension non-contributory), the initial disregard of capital is &euro;20,000.  In the case of disability allowance, there is an initial &euro;50,000 disregard, and for supplementary welfare allowance, an initial disregard of &euro;5,000 applies.</p><p>In the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance and the state pension non-contributory, capital is halved when assessing means for a claimant who is one of a couple.  There are also general means disregards applicable in these schemes.</p><p>In this regard, the capital assessment for the medical card may be more generous than the means assessment for some social assistance schemes, but it is also more onerous than some others.  Furthermore, it should be noted that eligibility for an income support is quite distinct from eligibility for a medical card.  </p><p>Any proposal to change the means assessment for means-tested social assistance schemes would have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;49.5 million for the scheme in 2018. The payment rates are &euro;125 for eligible children aged 4 to 11 years and &euro;250 for children aged over 12 years and attending secondary school.    Each year Barnardos completes a School Costs Survey and the results from 2017 indicated that on average parents paid approximately &euro;140 to &euro;150 for a primary school pupil&rsquo;s uniform and shoes and approximately &euro;260 for secondary school pupil&rsquo;s uniform and shoes.  The survey findings show that the current rates of payment meet most of the cost of clothing and footwear for school children, 89% of cost for senior infants and 96% for 1st year pupils. </p>  <p>  The household income limits for the scheme are being increased for 2018 to ensure that the increases in social welfare payment rates introduced by Budget 2018 do not negatively impact on people&rsquo;s entitlement to the allowance.</p>  <p>  In addition, in April 2017, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, published a circular on the measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs, as part of a range of measures to take greater account of the needs of parents and students in the school system.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the rates would have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

This will ensure that jobseekers can benefit from the job-seeking support of the JobPath service while also availing of a part-time work placement provided by CE or T&uacute;s.  This will have a number of benefits both for the vital services provided at a local level by participants on CE and T&uacute;s programmes and directly for the Department&rsquo;s customers.  It will, in particular, enable those people with the JobPath service to not only continue to receive the personalised employment counselling and jobsearch support provided by their JobPath personal advisors but also to avail of CE or T&uacute;s placement which will provide valuable occupational activity and work experience.  </p>  <p>  In making this change I was particularly conscious that case managed employment counselling and support is shown internationally, and in Ireland, to be the most effective means of supporting people back into sustained employment.  I did not wish for people to cease participation in this type of service in order to take up a place on a part-time State employment programme.  The decision I have now made enables people to benefit from both types of support.</p>  <p>  I was also conscious in taking this decision that the resource constraints that informed the Department&rsquo;s policy up to this point have abated somewhat.  In the past the Department operated what was a &lsquo;one person-one place&rsquo; policy in order to ration the available places among all jobseekers.  Given the welcome improvement in the labour market with unemployment now down to under 6% this policy can be relaxed.</p>  <p>  The JobPath service will be adapted to cater for those who opt to take up a T&uacute;s or Community Scheme and all meetings and activities will be scheduled to take account of the Scheme commitments.  For example if a person is committed to participate in the employment scheme for 5 mornings, all JobPath meetings including training and job search activities will be scheduled for the afternoons.  The JobPath companies will continue to provide all the supports which it currently provides.  CE and T&uacute;s providers will not have to make any changes to their operations.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced.  Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome.  It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.  This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors. My key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes and child benefit between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.  The importance of maintaining the Common Travel Area was acknowledged in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter of 29 March 2017 triggering Article 50 of the TEU,  the Joint EU/UK Progress report agreed at the European Council on 15th December 2017 and in the protocol to the draft Withdrawal Agreement published by the Commission on 28th  February 2018.</p>  <p>  I met with the UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Right Honourable Esther McVey, on Monday 23rd  April 2018.

Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions. </p>  <p>  In the case of defined benefit schemes, neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published in February of this year, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes. </p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a sponsoring employer will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions to a scheme can cease.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard. </p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage in the near future.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

It is designed as a universal payment, in recognition of the costs involved in raising children, and plays an important role in tackling child poverty.  As a universal payment it does not rely on a means test or social insurance contributions.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 629,000 families in respect of nearly 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2018.   I do not intend introducing a means-test for Child Benefit.  Means testing Child Benefit is not being considered by Government, and is not provided for in the Programme for Government. As Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I support the universality of the Child Benefit payment, and the principle that all families with children should receive this income support.  Given the universality of Child Benefit it is not a payment which lends itself to a targeted approach and the considerable costs associated with any upward adjustment to the payment can result in benefits being spread very thinly, rather than making a difference where there is most need.  Any such proposal would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  Government policy is to provide additional supports for parents and their children through increased services, rather than increased cash transfers.   This includes such services as free early years education through the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, and enhanced provision of affordable childcare.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded from the social insurance fund.Up to 2011, the scheme provided a rebate of 60 per cent to employers who provided statutory redundancy payments to their employees.  In Budgets 2012 and 2013, the Government first reduced and then abolished the rebate payment.  This decision was made because of the high cost of the rebate and its impact on the financial sustainability of the social insurance fund at the time of the economic crisis.  Furthermore, the rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, thus benefiting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies.  It was not a targeted use of the resources of the social insurance fund.</p>  <p>  The redundancy payments scheme, as it now operates, benefits employees whose employers are unable to pay for statutory redundancy.  Employers who declare they cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments, albeit they continue to trade, are required to submit documentation from their accountants or solicitors and to accept liability for the redundancy payment to the social insurance fund.  This ensures that the current scheme takes into account both an employer&rsquo;s ability to pay redundancy payments and that the social insurance fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if their financial position improves.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to reinstate the rebate scheme.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The report found that the changes made to the one-parent family payment scheme in 2012 increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective, as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the Budget measures to date, is likely to have impacted positively on poverty rates since 2016 (the most recent available data) and this improvement is expected to continue over the coming years.  My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of Budgets 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are an indicator of this improvement.  These show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents (and &euro;33.60 for unemployed lone parents).  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;34.45 for the average household.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 measures that took effect from 29th  March this year (specifically the increases to the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for a qualified child) will assist a lone parent in receipt of the one-parent family payment or jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage, to be better off by almost &euro;1,000 per year.</p>  <p>  We know that social transfers are very effective in reducing poverty and that Eurostat data shows that Ireland performs well in this regard.  But we also know that reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2016 shows that being at work reduces the consistent poverty rate for lone parents by nearly two-thirds, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.  </p>  <p>  Our focus, therefore, through the activation service provided by my Department, is on supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and, at a cross-governmental level on assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.</p></reply>

This will be a successor to the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion) and its 2015-2017 update which concluded last year.  My Department is developing the new four year plan for the period 2018-2021.  Like its predecessor, the plan will  have a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach that aims to improve outcomes for the vulnerable and marginalised in our society, while recognising a shared responsibility across Government to implement actions to achieve the overall objectives.  The theme of the new plan is one of active inclusion, which will enable every citizen, notably the most disadvantaged, to fully participate in society, including having a job.  The primary focus will be the reduction of consistent poverty, which in 2016 was 8.3%.  This will be achieved through a three pronged approach: supporting incomes through as high as possible a level of employment, and encouraging and assisting people to enter the workforce; setting targets for the level of relevant welfare payments designed to reduce relative poverty among those who cannot (or cannot find) work; and finally improving access to quality services such as health, education, childcare, training, housing, community supports in order to minimize deprivation for all groups and, in particular those who are on relatively low incomes.  Officials in my Department are working with their colleagues, both internally and in other departments, to identify specific actions for inclusion in the plan.  It is my intention that the plan will be published in Autumn 2018.</p></reply>

Seasonal work can be full-time, part-time or casual.  A seasonal worker who is employed on a full-time basis is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while in that employment.  Contributions paid during this time can be used to requalify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit subject to scheme conditionality. Where a person exhausts entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, they must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions after the last day of payment in order to requalify.  If a seasonal or a part-time worker meets this requirement they may requalify.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.</p>  <p>  Seasonal and part-time workers who have paid or credited contributions in either of the last two complete income tax years are awarded credits.  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI.</p>  <p>  The jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes can provide significant support to individuals who work part-time.  Where a person does not re-qualify or have used up their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  For instance, an individual can earn a little over &euro;20,190 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;34,700 if they are both working.</p>  <p>  My Department operates a fast-tracking system for customers who sign-off on their jobseeker&rsquo;s claim to take up work or a training course for a period of up to 12 weeks.  In these cases, the claim is not closed but payment is suspended temporarily for the duration of the work or training course.  When the person signs on again the claim can be reactivated without delay and payment restored. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes would have to be considered in the context of Budget 2019 subject to the overall budgetary context.  It is important in the interests of equity and fairness that any changes to the conditions for receipt of a jobseekers payment would apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work, to ensure that as many as possible of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people.  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 11.9% (32,300 persons) in May 2018 estimated by CSO, down from a peak rate of almost 32% in 2012.  The youth unemployment rate now lies significantly below the EU-28 average rate of 16.1%.  The actual number of young people unemployed is estimated to have peaked at 97,800 persons in late 2010.  Youth unemployment figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment.</p><p>In early 2018, youth unemployment is already below the 12% target level set in Pathways to Work for 2020.  Additionally, Eurostat figures indicate that the number of young people in full-time employment has grown from 197,000 in mid-2012 to 238,000 by Q4 2017.</p><p>These trends indicate that together with improvements in the labour market and economic recovery, our approach to youth employment, which focuses in the first instance on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to find and secure sustainable jobs, has been relatively successful.  </p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities. </p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under-25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.</p><p>The strategy document<i>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020</i>includes some additional actions in relation to addressing youth unemployment: </p><p>1)  increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work) for youth unemployed;  </p><p>2) ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;  </p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers;</p><p>4) implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.  </p><p>Each of these actions is either ongoing or has been completed.</p><p>I will shortly be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment.  The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  Operational details are currently being finalised.</p><p>In line with other EU and OECD jurisdictions where such measures feature, reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009 and extended to those under 26 in Budget 2014.  These measures were introduced to protect young people from welfare dependency by providing young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.</p><p>Where a young jobseeker participates on an education or training programme they receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;198 which is the maximum personal rate for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  In addition, recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance under 26 years of age who have dependent children are not subject to the reduced rates.  Reduced rates also do not apply to people under 25 who were in the care of the State during the year prior to their 18th birthday.</p><p>The appropriate rate for all social welfare rates of payment, including the weekly rates for young jobseekers, will be considered by Government in the context of budgetary deliberations.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) have taken the lead in addressing the entitlement of CE supervisors to occupational pensions.  A Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by DPER is currently examining this issue.  Other Departments including my Department are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal and a number of meetings have been held.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.

The main advertising campaign ran over a two week period from the 7th May, with digital and social media promotions continuing for a further two weeks.  The campaign directed people to a dedicated page on my Department&rsquo;s website as a first step. The website provides important information on the impact of false self-employment and the criteria used to determine whether someone is an employee or self-employed, as well as contact information for Scope section, the Workplace Relations Commission and Revenue.  The new web page has attracted more than 10,500 visits during the campaign with an average time of over three minutes spent on the page which is regarded as very favourable.

Contingent employment generally describes an employment relationship that is non-permanent &ndash; that is employees on temporary contracts and freelancers.  The ESRI presented its initial findings at a WRC seminar on the World of Work last February.</p><p>The main conclusion of the ESRI research presented at that time was that the incidence of contingent employment ranged between 8 and 9 percent of total employment between 1998 and 2005 before increasing to over 10 percent following the recession, then falling back towards its pre-recession level in 2016.  I understand that the final report of the ESRI is due to be published shortly.  Further, I note from the Central Statistics Office Labour Force Survey for Quarter 4 2017 that the increase in total employment of 66,800 in the year to Q4 2017 was represented by an increase in full-time employment of 90,000 (an increase of 5.4%) and a decrease in part-time employment of 23,300 (a decrease of 4.8%).  </p><p>Good progress has been made in recent years in terms of our economic recovery, in creating new job opportunities, the majority of which are full-time positions.

Child Benefit is a universal payment to help families with the cost of raising children and plays an important role in tackling child poverty.  Receipt of the payment is not contingent on a means test or social insurance contributions.  Child Benefit is a monthly payment made to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 629,000 families in respect of nearly 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2018. As Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I support the universality of the Child Benefit payment, and the principle that all families with children should receive this income support.</p>  <p>  Given the universality of Child Benefit it is not a payment which lends itself to a targeted approach and the considerable costs associated with any upward adjustment to the payment can result in benefits being spread very thinly, rather than making a difference where there is most need.  Government policy is to provide additional supports for parents and their children through increased services, rather than increased cash transfers.  This includes such services as free early-years education through the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, and enhanced provision of affordable childcare.  Any enhanced budgetary spending in these areas will be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  Finally, I understand the Deputy had a specific interest in relation to Home Carer Tax Credit.  This is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

To qualify for the payment, a customer must be a farmer, farming land in the State, aged between 18 and 66 and satisfy a means test.  The annual farm assist review form is a necessary part of the normal review process for these customers.</p><p>The means test for farm assist takes account of all income sources with certain disregards applicable to specific income sources.  Different rules apply to income from farming and other forms of self-employment.  Income from certain schemes such as the Green Low Carbon Agri Environment Scheme (GLAS), income from employment and income from property and capital are taken into account.  An examination of farm outgoings is also included in the assessment process.</p><p>Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  Details of any exceptional circumstances are also taken into account so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  </p><p>The information provided by the customer on the review form covers both the income generated and the operating costs associated with the farm, all of which are required as part of the annual review process.  </p><p>The annual farm assist review form is kept under ongoing review by my officials and there are no plans to change the current review criteria.</p></reply>

Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to jobseekers benefit, he or she must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions after the last day of payment in order to requalify.  The 13 contributions needed to re-qualify for jobseekers benefit can be paid in respect of full time employment, seasonal employment, part-time employment or casual employment.  If a seasonal or a part time worker meets this requirement they may requalify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  This requirement is in place to ensure the person has a reasonable connection with the labour market before he or she can requalify for payment.  If a person does not re-qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or has used up his or her entitlement to jobseeker's benefit, then he or she may qualify for jobseekers allowance, subject to the means test and other conditions.</p>  <p>  The current days based system can also provide significant income supports to jobseekers who are part-time workers or casually employed.  For instance an individual can earn a little over &euro;20,190 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;34,700 if they are both working.</p>  <p>  I intend to submit the report on jobseekers benefit duration and the treatment of seasonal and part-time workers to the Joint Oireachtas Committee shortly.  This report will be published subsequently.  The report may inform any changes considered in the context of Budget 2019 subject to the overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the day-to-day delivery of the Civil Registration Service through a network of local civil registration office across the State.  Births are registered at local registrar&rsquo;s and Superintendent Registrar&rsquo;s offices.</p>  <p>  Adoptions are registered by the Registrar General. The register of births records such data as are required by law relating to each birth occurring in the State.  The information recorded is provided to the registrar by a qualified informant, normally, the parents or a member of staff of the hospital or nursing home where the birth took place.  The registrar is reliant on the qualified informant to provide truthful and accurate information.  From a visual inspection of a register entry it is impossible to say whether it is false or not.  Questionable entries in the register can only be identified on foot of information or evidence given by third parties.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone, T.D., recently announced that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, would be contacting people in 126 cases where births were incorrectly registered between 1946 and 1969.  These cases were identified during an analysis of adoption records that were transferred to Tusla by the former adoption society St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.</p>  <p>  Minister Zappone has directed that further investigations be carried out now to see if clear evidence of incorrect registrations can be obtained from the records of other former adoption agencies held by Tusla or the Adoption Authority.  I understand that the terms of reference for the review will be published shortly.  The GRO will cooperate fully with any request for assistance by Tusla or by any individual affected by this issue.  Illegal entries in the register of births, where they have been identified, can be dealt with under existing legislation which provides for cancellation, correction of errors and late registrations.</p></reply>

In February 2016, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland put forward proposals to process outstanding legacy inquests relating to the Troubles. The Government has been strongly supportive of the LCJ&rsquo;s proposals as a way of ensuring that those families who are still waiting for legacy inquests are not left to wait any longer. </p>  <p>  I have consistently emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced and I continue to raise this issue with the Secretary of State on an ongoing basis.  I have urged all with those with responsibilities in relation to legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland. The Government is continuing to seek urgent progress on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Government will also continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties to seek an urgent way forward on the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework in a manner that will meet the legitimate needs and expectations of all victims and survivors, and contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

The fact of the UK&rsquo;s presentation on 7 June of a paper on a temporary customs arrangement, which it sees as relevant to aspects of the island of Ireland backstop, was a welcome, though incomplete, step forward in this regard.</p>  <p>  After its publication, Michel Barnier, while also welcoming this step, raised questions and concerns about the proposal.  The absence of proposals on regulatory alignment is clearly a major gap &ndash; though the UK has acknowledged that this aspect needs to be addressed &ndash; as is the suggestion that the arrangement should be time-limited, though it is welcome that the date of end-2021 is aspirational.  The Commission, in its further analysis of the paper, has identified numerous issues related to the proposal&rsquo;s legal and technical viability, and to its compatibility with the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union.  It is the Commission which is the Union&rsquo;s negotiator with the British Government on these issues.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus remains on the outcome we need to see, of which a key element is ensuring the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is welcome that the UK&rsquo;s commitment to this is reaffirmed in its proposal, and that the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK in the joint progress report of December 2017 and repeated by Prime Minister May in her letter to President Tusk in March have been reiterated.</p>  <p>  Michel Barnier and his team also provide regular updates to the EU27 Member States on the discussions on the future EU-UK relationship, which are progressing, albeit slowly.  The EU is approaching these discussions in accordance with the March European Council Guidelines, which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the UK in the future.  These Guidelines also emphasised that any future agreement must have the correct balance of rights and obligations and that the integrity of the Single Market must be preserved.  Clearly, it is in Ireland&rsquo;s strong interest to have the closest possible EU-UK relationship, within the parameters set by the UK&rsquo;s own red lines, which we hope may be modified.</p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I also engage frequently with our UK counterparts on a wide range of issues of mutual interest. In addition to further strengthening our bilateral ties, such engagement also provides an opportunity to build the UK&rsquo;s understanding of the EU&rsquo;s position on the Irish-specific issues and underline the importance of finalizing the Protocol as an integral and indispensable part of the Withdrawal Agreement </p>  <p>  I have spoken with the Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, on a number of occasions in recent weeks.  During these exchanges, I have stressed that, while our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided.  I have underlined that we must have certainty in all scenarios on the commitments made on Ireland and Northern Ireland and that this certainty requires agreement on the Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.  The sooner this can be agreed, the sooner substantial negotiations on the future relationship, which will determine the arrangements for east/west trade and many other important issues, can begin.</p></reply>

The locations for new missions agreed by Government were identified on the basis of maximising impact in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests; expanding our influence in terms of values and in delivering clear benefits for the State.</p>  <p>  In addition to the opening of new diplomatic and consular missions, the Department is taking steps to deepen the existing network, including to address the impact of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  The decisions already made to augment staff in missions in Europe as a more direct response to Brexit also contribute to the objectives of the &ldquo;Global Ireland&rdquo; initiative.</p>  <p>  A project team in headquarters is undertaking extensive planning to ensure that the Department&rsquo;s human and financial resources are used efficiently to deliver on the expansion and deepening of the network in a timely and cost-effective way.</p>  <p>  The Government has approved Heads of Mission appointments for the first phase comprising six new missions to be opened in 2018 and early 2019.  These are for Embassies and Consulates in Bogot&aacute;, Santiago, Amman, Wellington, Mumbai, and Vancouver.  These missions will be further supported by posted officer(s) from Headquarters, as well as by locally recruited staff.  Additional staff will also be assigned shortly to a number of existing missions overseas including Consulates in the United States, Europe, the Middle East/Gulf region and Asia.</p>  <p>  Preparations for augmenting the key units in headquarters needed to support the expansion are underway and five additional staff were assigned recently to Corporate Services Division.  This is to reinforce specialist knowledge, including in architectural and project management areas as well as bolster human resources skills to facilitate expanded recruitment and a strong focus on staff development.  A scoping of broader staffing needs across operational and policy areas is underway to identify additional new positions relating to the &ldquo;Global Ireland&rdquo; expansion.  These positions will be at headquarters and abroad and those in missions overseas will comprise locally recruited and posted staff. </p>  <p>  The Department is currently undertaking a workforce planning exercise which will inform plans for recruitment of new officers both in Ireland and abroad as well as plans for the training, development and up-skilling of officers currently assigned to the Department to meet the objectives of the Global Ireland initiative in 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

Our discussions included Brexit, developments in the EU generally and our respective bilateral relationship with Africa.</p>  <p>  In Munich I also met with the Bavarian Minister for Digital, Media and Europe Georg Eisenreich.  Brexit, the opening of the Consulate in Frankfurt and Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Bavaria were the main items discussed. </p>  <p>  In Berlin I participated in a high-level Round Table discussion at the European Council on Foreign Relations.  In my remarks I addressed a number of key global issues including the Middle East Peace Process and EU-Africa relations.  The Q&amp;A following my address was dominated by Brexit with participants eager to hear Ireland&rsquo;s assessment of developments.  The Future of Europe including the ongoing Migration crisis were among the other issues discussed.</p>  <p>  I was honoured to be welcomed to the Bundestag by its President Wolfgang Schauble, who served as German Federal Finance Minister for many years.  I briefed him on Ireland&rsquo;s economy, the fastest growing in the Eurozone.  As in most other meetings, Brexit was a major topic of discussion and I thanked President Schauble for Germany&rsquo;s ongoing support for Ireland in the negotiations. </p>  <p>  In the Bundestag I met with the European Affairs Committee. In my remarks I focused on Brexit and the questions from Members also focused on that issue including the likely impact on our economy. Other matters discussed were EU enlargement, the Multiannual Financial Framework and taxation.</p>  <p>  While in the Bundestag I also met the German-Irish Parliamentary Friendship Group.  The expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint, Corporation Tax as well as Brexit were the items covered in what was a brief session. </p>  <p>  I had a very positive meeting with Lucia Puttrich, Minister for European and Federal Affairs of the State of Hesse.  Since Frankfurt is in Hesse, our exchanges focused on the opening of an Irish Consulate there next year. Brexit was also discussed.</p>  <p>  My final official meeting was with the leader of the FDP (Liberal) Party, Christian Lindner who was particularly interested in the border in the context of Brexit and the possible effects on our economy.</p>  <p>  During the visit I also conducted a number of press interviews and media briefings.</p>  <p>  I met members of the Irish community in Berlin at a reception at the Embassy of Ireland where I launched &ldquo;Ireland in Germany: A Wider and Deeper Footprint&rdquo;, the report on the outcome of the comprehensive review of bilateral relations with Germany which I commissioned in December 2017.</p>  <p>  I was honoured to give an address at the Humboldt University in Berlin on the theme of &ldquo;Ireland, Germany and Europe: Shaping the post-Brexit EU&rdquo;.  The speech was part of the prestigious &ldquo;Humboldt Speeches on Europe&rdquo; series.</p>  <p>  Germany is an indispensable partner for Ireland and that informed my decision last year to commission a review of our bilateral relationship.  The review was published in April and we have begun to implement its recommendations, the first of which is to open of a career Consulate in Frankfurt.  This was warmly welcomed by my German interlocutors.</p>  <p>  During my visit to Germany, I was struck by the interest in and goodwill displayed towards Ireland by all interlocutors.  The focus now is on implementing the recommendations of the review of bilateral relations, strengthening and deepening our relations with Germany. </p></reply>

I met Foreign Minister Safadi, and discussed bilateral relations and regional issues, including the Middle East Peace Process and the Syria crisis.  I also visited a refugee camp where I met with Syrian refugees, and with representatives of the Jordanian authorities and the UN agencies which are providing them with assistance.</p>  <p>  In Israel and Palestine on 6 and 7 June, I met on the Israeli side with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli Opposition Leader Itzhak Herzog.  In Palestine I met with Foreign Minister Malki and Chief Negotiator Erekat, and with Dr. Mohammad Shtayyeh, head of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction.  I also met with the United States Ambassador to Israel, to discuss US efforts to develop a peace plan. </p>  <p>  My discussions were focused on the broader prospects to restart the political process, centred on current US efforts.  I also followed up on the discussions I began on my previous visits, relating to practical assistance for Gaza, and ways of changing the dynamic there, something which is especially important following the shocking recent events there, on which my views are clear. Ireland co-sponsored and spoke in favour of the recent UN Human Rights Council resolution setting up a Commission of Inquiry into Israel&rsquo;s handling of the protests which is now being put in place.  My view that the move of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem was unhelpful, and has made the search for peace more difficult, was clear as a backdrop to my discussions.  There was also some discussion of regional issues. </p>  <p>  I did not raise the individual case referenced by Deputy Collins on this occasion, although the Government has previously expressed its strong criticisms of the extensive use of administrative detention by the Israeli authorities.  Prime Minister Netanyahu is already well aware of my views on settlements from previous conversations.</p>  <p>  In Cyprus on 8 June I met Foreign Minister Christodoulides and discussed Ireland-Cyprus relations and EU issues, including Brexit. Cyprus&rsquo; unique position in the EU also allowed for a useful discussion of the issues I had explored in Jordan, Israel and Palestine.  I also met with the UN Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), Elizabeth Spehar.</p></reply>

The CTA is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and the continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of both the Irish and UK Governments.</p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area provides for associated rights and entitlements in both jurisdictions to enable Irish and UK citizens to move freely between them and reside in them.  These rights and entitlements include access to employment, healthcare, education, and social benefits, as well as the right to vote in certain elections. </p>  <p>  Article 2 in the Draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is a translation into legal terms of the acknowledgment between the EU and UK negotiators made in their joint report of December 2017 that the UK and Ireland may &ldquo;continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories&rdquo;.  This has been marked as green, indicating it has been agreed at negotiator level.  This is a welcome provision in seeking to maintain the Common Travel Area, insofar as it relates to the EU-UK negotiations. </p>  <p>  The primary focus of the work to maintain the Common Travel Area is bilateral and therefore does not relate to matters of negotiation between the EU and the UK.

In January 2016, a consultation event was held in Iveagh House on the Working Outline of Ireland&rsquo;s National Plan on Business and Human Rights.  Following an invitation for submissions based on the Working Outline, responses were received from civil society and the business community.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade remains committed to supporting the advancement of human rights in the region, and I condemn unreservedly any act of intimidation or violence perpetrated against those seeking to defend their rights.</p><p>Guatemala has made some strides in its political and social development over the past two decades since the gradual cessation of armed conflict from 1996 onwards.  While overcoming the legacy of human rights crimes committed during the country&rsquo;s civil war remains a challenge, it is essential to Guatemala&rsquo;s future development and I urge the Government of Guatemala to address historical impunity at all levels. </p><p>Most recently, Ireland used the occasion of the 28th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 8 November 2017 to express its concern in relation to attacks against human rights defenders in Guatemala.  Ireland also noted that there have been worrying instances of harassment, intimidation and criminalisation of human rights defenders in the country.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s statement recommended that Guatemala take all necessary steps to protect human rights defenders through the removal of legal and policy measures which inhibit the ability of human rights defenders to carry out their vital work in safety, without fear of interference, obstruction or harassment of any kind, including by finalising the Public Policy for the Protection of HRDs with strong participation by civil society and an adequate budgetary allocation.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s statement on Guatemala at the Human Rights Council is available for review on the Department&rsquo;s website: <i> </i></p><p>Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade also meet regularly with human rights defenders and civil society organisations active in Latin America, including in Guatemala and including those working on land rights, an increasingly important issue in the region. </p><p>While Ireland does not have a resident embassy in Guatemala City, in keeping with our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and working with partners on the ground, we will continue to follow the situation in Guatemala closely, and to raise our concerns regarding threats against human rights defenders in discussions on Guatemala at EU and international level. </p></reply>

This will be an important subject at the European Council next week.</p>  <p>  In such a common approach, it is essential to find additional ways to demonstrate practical solidarity with front-line states, such as Italy.  I acknowledge the generous response by the new Spanish Government.  It is also imperative to respect the dignity and human rights of those who arrive on our shores.</p>  <p>  The Irish Naval Service has saved the lives of many migrants, first as part of Operation Pontus and more recently as part of EUNAVFOR MED, also known as Operation Sophia.</p>  <p>  I strongly believe that solving the migration crisis will ultimately require deeper political, economic and development relationships between the EU and neighbouring countries, including many in Africa, that is fit for purpose and capable of dealing with a variety of challenges on the basis of shared responsibility.</p></reply>

The vote on the resolution was 95 in favour, 15 against, with 65 abstentions.</p>  <p>  Ireland gave considerable attention to the Resolution put before the UN General Assembly on this matter.  We weighed the various points of view and listened carefully to the arguments put forward. </p>  <p>  After very careful review we felt that the most appropriate step to take was abstention, given the arguments from one side that this is an improper attempt to bring a bilateral dispute before the ICJ and from the other that there are matters of general relevance to the international community relating to de-colonisation.</p>  <p>  An abstention is consistent with the position Ireland has taken on previous ICJ referral resolutions, including in 2003 on the separation wall between Israel and the Palestinian Territory and in 2010 on Kosovo&rsquo;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence.</p>  <p>  The ICJ Statute and the Court&rsquo;s Rules of Procedure provide that the ICJ may communicate with States which it believes are likely to be able to furnish information on the question and invite them to submit written or oral statements.  The deadline for written statements has now expired and the Court has not yet indicated whether oral proceedings will take place in this case. </p>  <p>  It is now for the ICJ to decide whether it has jurisdiction to deal with the matter; and, if so, whether it is appropriate to exercise that jurisdiction; and, if it is appropriate to do so, to deal with the merits of the arguments put before it.</p></reply>

In recognition of the frustration felt both in Palestine and here in Ireland over the lack of progress towards that objective, I have made clear repeatedly in the D&aacute;il that I am prepared to recommend to the Government early recognition by Ireland of a State of Palestine, if and when I consider that it might be helpful towards advancing the peace process and achieving the objective we seek.  I have not yet concluded that that moment has arrived.</p>  <p>  I recognise of course that such a gesture by Ireland could be a welcome sign of support for Palestinians, against a backdrop of hardship and frustration.  But it would be a symbolic gesture, and as such, the Government must also consider the likely impact, and the effect of such an action on Ireland&rsquo;s own influence and standing on this and other questions. </p></reply>

Following a plebiscite in October 2016, elements of the accord were renegotiated and a revised agreement was approved by the Colombian Congress in November 2016, ending a conflict which had afflicted Colombian society for over half a century.  </p>  <p>  Since then, historic strides have been made in the implementation of the peace accords, including the full decommissioning under UN supervision of FARC weapons by July 2017, seven months after the agreement was finalised, and the transformation of the FARC into a political party.  Formal peace negotiations between the Government of Colombia and the guerilla National Liberation Army (ELN) resumed in May of this year and a ceasefire was agreed in the run-up and aftermath of both the first and second rounds of the presidential election which took place this month.  It is my hope that these negotiations, which are taking place in Havana, can yield meaningful results. </p>  <p>  However, as we know from our own experience, achieving peace can be complex and challenging and is far from straightforward.  Significant challenges remain in implementation, including in the areas of demining, attention to victims, transitional justice, and rural development, as highlighted earlier this year by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. </p>  <p>  Indeed, the implementation of many aspects of the agreement was put on hold as preparations for this month&rsquo;s presidential elections were taking place.  The first round of the presidential election took place on 27 May 2018.  Iv&aacute;n Duque, of Centro Democr&aacute;tico (CD), and Gustavo Petro, of the Colombia Humana movement, came in first and second place respectively. </p>  <p>  The second round of the election took place between Duque and Petro on Sunday last, 17 June 2018.  With most of the ballot counted, Iv&aacute;n Duque had secured the highest number of votes with more than 10 million votes, representing 54% of the total.  He will assume office as President of Colombia in mid-August for a four year term. </p>  <p>  This is a period of transition in Colombia, and it will be some time before the various actors settle in to their respective roles following the election.  While Mr Duque has pledged to revisit elements of the 2016 peace deal, the official position of the new administration in Colombia in relation to the peace process is not yet known, and I expect that full details will become clearer in the coming months. </p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the agreement, which will ensure a more peaceful future for all Colombians, including by establishing good relations with the new administration once in place. </p></reply>

Conditions are likely to deteriorate over the coming months as the monsoon season progresses.  The exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages. Efforts by the international community to address this crisis have focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis, promoting a political solution and pressing for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred. Most recently, on 6 June, a Memorandum of Understanding has been agreed between Myanmar and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and UNDP, the UN Development Programme, to establish a framework for cooperation between the parties aimed at creating conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of these refugees from Bangladesh to their places of origin.  The MoU also aims to help create improved and resilient livelihoods for all communities living in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively engage with our international partners in these efforts through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses.  Ireland will be active on this issue at the upcoming 38th Session of the Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating and recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position including in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Council Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February last.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, support the mandates of the Fact Finding Mission and Special Rapporteur and provide for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for these acts.  These sanctions are now being put in place. </p>  <p>  While these efforts are aimed at achieving a political solution to the crisis, there is also a critical need for a coherent humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh.  To this end, Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1 million allocated for 2018. Our support has focused on food, shelter, water and sanitation.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response facility, we have provided 37 tonnes of hygiene, sanitation and shelter kits and deployed experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination on the ground.  In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassy in Thailand who are closely monitoring the situation. </p></reply>

The proposal was prepared by the Commission without any input from Member States. The re-launched CCCTB is split into two separate Directives &ndash; a Directive for a Common Corporate Tax Base (CCTB) and a second Directive for a Consolidated CCTB.   Although the Commission presented these as a unified package, the CCTB is being discussed first and consolidation will only be discussed once the CCTB is agreed.  </p>  <p>  At the December 2016 ECOFIN, Council Conclusions were approved in respect of the Commission's wider package which included the CCCTB proposal but there was no specific discussion of the proposals at that meeting.  The work on the CCCTB proposal is now taking place in technical working groups at Council and Ireland is actively involved in this work.  </p>  <p>  By its nature, the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) is a complex and detailed proposal and Member States need to fully analyse and consider its potential impact on national tax systems.  Member States are discussing and debating the various aspects of the proposal in the relevant tax working parties. These discussions are progressing but much more technical consideration is needed.</p>  <p>  Ireland is an active participant at both EU and OECD level in discussions on reform the international corporate tax system. Currently, the focus is on examining how international tax rules may need to be adapted to address the challenges arising from the ongoing digitisation of the economy.</p>  <p>  The reform of the international tax system is regularly discussed at ECOFIN meetings where it is commonly agreed that in order to be effective, any changes to the rules should be globally agreed, evidence based, sustainable in the long run and focussed on aligning taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.   </p></reply>

The reason lies in the incidental number of days the individuals are present in the Republic of Ireland, which creates numerous practical difficulties associated with gathering data.  For example, the vast majority of non-resident entertainers do not file an Irish tax return as they are not obliged to do so on an annual basis, unlike Irish tax residents.</p>  <p>  However, I can advise that in general where a concert takes place in Ireland, the artist&rsquo;s performance fee is also subject to Irish VAT. Where an international performer is engaged by a promoter, it is the responsibility of the promoter to account for the VAT due on the performance fee. This means that where the promoter is established in Ireland, the promoter is required to account for Irish VAT on the performance fee. In circumstances where the artist and promoter are both established outside the State, the promoter is required to account for VAT on the performance fee where she/he is established.</p>  <p>  Where a premises provider allows a promoter who is not established in the State to hold a concert on their premises, the provider must report details of the event to Revenue. Failure to do so can make the premises provider jointly liable for any VAT arising. This is a safeguard provision to ensure the correct VAT is collected and paid in relation to any merchandise sold at the concert venue.</p></reply>

While a number of the recommendations in the Motor Report are relevant to the area of business insurance &ndash; in particular, the recommendations regarding the Book of Quantum, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; it became clear in preparing the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>that there was also a pressing need to examine the drivers for the rising cost of business insurance.</p><p>The second phase work culminated in the publication on January 25<sup>th</sup>2018 of the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>, following its approval by Government.  This new Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out, detailed in an Action Plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation. </p><p>The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:</p><p><b>- Increase Transparency: </b>enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes,</p><p><b>- Review the level of damages in personal injury cases:</b>request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, and</p><p><b>- Improve the personal injuries litigation framework:</b>through a number of measures, including: </p><p>a. ensuring potential defendants are notified in  sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy; </p><p>b. tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and </p><p>c. ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the Judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.</p><p>All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.  The fifth Quarterly Progress Update on implementation was published on 11 May and shows that in respect of the actions from the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>due for completion in Q1 2018, all eight deadlines have been met.  Both of the primary Reports and all of the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.</p><p>As the issue of insurance costs is an important policy area, the Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>in parallel with implementing those from the 2017 Motor Report.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses.</p></reply>

This applies to qualified cohabitants, i.e.  persons who have been in a committed and loving relationship with another person for a minimum period of 5 years (2 years where they are parents of one or more dependent children), whose relationship has ended due to death or separation and neither of whom was married to and living with another person in 4 of the 5 years immediately before the end of the relationship. </p>  <p>  In a case of intestacy, or where a deceased qualified cohabitant has failed to provide in a will for the other qualified cohabitant, the surviving qualified cohabitant can apply for a court order under Part 15 of the CPCROC Act 2010. The court, in considering the application, will take into account a number of factors including the financial circumstances of the applicant and the claim of any other relevant parties to benefits from the deceased&rsquo;s estate. If the applicant obtains a court order for the transfer of property, then the property transferring will be exempt from inheritance tax.</p>  <p>  Where a cohabitant has specifically provided for a surviving cohabitant in his or her will, the usual inheritance tax provisions apply. While transfers between spouses and civil partners are exempt from inheritance tax, a tax-free threshold (Group Threshold), below which inheritance tax does not arise, applies in the case of other types of relationship between the person who provides the inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary).   </p>  <p>  There are three separate Group Thresholds. The Group A threshold (currently &euro;310,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases, including cohabiting couples. </p>  <p>  The redress scheme introduced for formerly cohabiting couples under the CPCROC Act 2010 provided protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples and provided safeguards for an economically dependent cohabitant where a relationship ended or on death. The introduction of an exemption from inheritance tax was part of a suite of changes to the Tax Acts consequent on the redress provisions. Thus, a transfer of property under a redress court order is not liable to stamp duty, the transferor of property does not have a capital gains tax liability on the transfer and the recipient of property is not liable to gift tax or inheritance tax. Without these changes, the cohabiting couple would be treated as unconnected individuals and full charges to each of these taxes could arise. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the exemption from gift tax and inheritance tax in these cases was not intended to give cohabiting couples the same tax treatment as married couples or civil partners but simply legislated for the tax consequences of the redress arrangements for cohabitants under the CPCROC Act 2010.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-19a.265.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061900064#WRG00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 to 143, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it is necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals. As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. </p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)). The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. </p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios). In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined. </p>  <p>  The wealth tax scenarios in the research paper that are closest to the wealth taxes outlined by the Deputy in his questions are the high threshold-large exemptions scenario (which best matches the scenario set out in PQ 26374), and the high threshold-no exemptions scenarios (which best matches the scenario outlined in PQ 26372) in Table 5 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study. </p>  <p>  The first of these scenarios (high threshold-large exemption) has a personal threshold of &euro;1.0 million (doubled if married and a &euro;500,000 increase per child), applies a 1% tax rate and excludes farms, the household main residence, business and pension assets. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;53 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study. The research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioural response to the tax is modelled. The estimate of &euro;53 million, therefore, is likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised. </p>  <p>  The second scenario (high threshold-no exemption), applies a 1% tax rate but allows for no exclusions. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;248 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study. Again, the research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioural response to the tax is modelled. The estimate of &euro;248 million, therefore, is also likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised.  </p>  <p>  Given that the above scenarios are not identical to those outlined in the Deputy's questions, care should be taken in interpreting the revenue estimates. </p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's questions, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose. This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete. It is also noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes. As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question.</p>  <p>  However, there are a number of additional scenarios set out in the paper which the Deputy may find informative.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-19a.286.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061900064#WRG03100"><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms and conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.</p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years and, indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, which was published in January 2017, makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes. </p><p>In line with the EU framework, the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s starting position on insurance for taxi drivers was that it was not possible for it to make a recommendation on pricing as this is primarily a commercial matter for insurers. It did however recognise that this sector serves a social as well as an economic purpose, particularly in rural areas where public transport is less readily available.  This position was acknowledged by the inclusion of Recommendation 10 in the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  This recommended that the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles should enter regular discussions with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector. </p><p>That Fifth Update Report, published on 11 May 2018 at , outlines the implementation of this recommendation.  In summary, Insurance Ireland met with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC), on 22 May 2017.  The TAC submitted the required report in relation to this meeting on 21 June 2017 to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To date, no further meetings have taken place between the TAC and Insurance Ireland.  However, the TAC has advised my officials that it is keeping itself informed of developments in the area, particularly through the industry representatives on the Committee, and future meetings with Insurance Ireland are a part of the TAC strategy.  Recommendation 10 has been completed in the sense that the TAC has reported to the Minister for Transport.  Notwithstanding this, my view would be that work needs to continue on this general issue.  Therefore, I look forward to further engagements between the TAC and the insurance industry.  </p><p>I would add that, notwithstanding the role of the TAC, the issues raised by the taxi sector were in the main similar to those affecting consumers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that the implementation of both the Cost of Insurance Working Group Motor Report and Employer/Public Liability Report should deliver fairer premiums for consumers, including taxi drivers. In addition, I am of the view that this ongoing work should better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently.</p></reply>

This is an increase of &euro;500m from the previous estimate in its 2016 Annual Report, and a testament to the progress that NAMA has made in achieving its primary objective of enhancing the value of its assets in the interest of the State.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that this is a projected surplus - it will only materialise after NAMA&rsquo;s debt is fully repaid and NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing work is completed.  It is expected that NAMA will substantially complete its work by 2020. The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and in April 2018 it redeemed &euro;243m of its subordinated debt. However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of repaying the State&rsquo;s contingent liability, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA. </p>  <p>  This work includes completion of NAMA&rsquo;s residential and Docklands SDZ funding programmes, the repayment of its outstanding subordinated debt of &euro;1.4bn, and deleveraging of the remainder of its loan portfolio. The carrying value of the portfolio as year-end 2017, net of cumulative impairment, was &euro;3.2 billion. I am advised that this residual loan portfolio will require intensive case management and asset management if the projected terminal surplus is to be realised. As such, the projected surplus will not accrue to the State before 2020.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

Generally the regime provides that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising within the investment.  Instead, tax applies at an investor level.  </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2006 introduced the concept of deemed disposals every 8 years in relation to these investments. A deemed disposal occurs 8 years following inception of a policy of life assurance or acquisition of a fund and then every 8 years thereafter.  The deemed disposal rules also apply to equivalent offshore funds.  Any gain on the investment which arises from the date of inception or the date of acquisition to the date of the deemed disposal is subject to tax. This ensures that income isn&rsquo;t being rolled up in life assurance policies or funds without being taxed. On the ultimate disposal of the investment any tax paid which arose as a result of a deemed disposal is allowed as a credit against any final tax liability on disposal. </p>  <p>  The 8 year deemed disposal rule is not currently under review at this time.</p></reply>

For Ireland this is currently a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP.</p>  <p>  Assessment of compliance with the requirements of the preventive arm takes a two-pillar approach. Assessment of the structural balance, the first pillar, is complemented by an analysis of the growth rate of an expenditure aggregate net of discretionary revenue measures, i.e. the expenditure benchmark, which constitutes the second pillar. Compliance with the preventive arm is assessed through an overall assessment taking both elements into account.</p>  <p>  Member States at their MTO must ensure that government expenditure grows at most in line with a medium-term rate of potential GDP growth, unless any excess growth is matched by discretionary revenue raising measures. The medium-term rate of potential growth ensures adherence to the MTO over time.</p>  <p>  If a Member State has overachieved its MTO then any deviation on the expenditure benchmark shall not be considered significant, taking into account the possibility that significant revenue windfalls and the budgetary plans laid out in the Stability Programme do not jeopardise the MTO over the programme period.</p></reply>

The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan in the Report.</p><p>Work has been ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group prepare quarterly updates on its progress.</p><p>The <i>Fifth Progress Update</i>was published on the Department of Finance website on 11 May 2018.  It shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set up to the end of Q1 2018 within the Action Plan, 40 have been met, while substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;. </p><p>In relation to both the outstanding actions from previous quarters and to the remaining 12 actions scheduled for completion in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2018, all efforts are being undertaken in order to complete them as soon as possible. At this juncture, as highlighted in the last update report, it is anticipated that the action points likely to be delayed beyond 2018 are those related to the large-scale initiatives under the remit of the Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  These include the completion of the Master Licence Record project and the database to identify uninsured drivers.  However, it is expected that the vast majority of the Action Plan will be completed by the end of this year.</p><p>For more information on the status of each individual recommendation, including the envisaged timeframes for completion, I refer the Deputy to the quarterly update reports.

While it is accepted that motor insurance premiums are still at a very high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis.  I am hopeful that this trend in pricing will be maintained and that premiums shall continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 the rate was 0.60% of the scheme assets.  For the year 2014 the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%.  Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy was passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p><p>The legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it was applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.  In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.</p><p>Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme.  The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.</p><p>The Pension Scheme Levy has ceased since 2015. </p><p>Revenues raised from the Pension Levy were not hypothecated and formed part of the Exchequer.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-19a.315.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061900065#WRH00900"><p>I am aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy in relation to the financial strain which the cost of insurance is placing on some community and voluntary organisations.  However, the Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and that neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.</p>  <p>  However, what was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group was that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.  In this regard, the initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The second phase of the Cost of Insurance Working Group under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, published its report in relation to employer liability and public liability insurance in January 2018.  This Report acknowledges that many of the difficulties being faced by business are also impacting community groups.</p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s second Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out.  The recommendations and actions are detailed in an action plan contained in the report with agreed timelines for implementation.  All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.   The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:</p>  <p>  - Increase Transparency: enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes</p>  <p>  - Review the level of damages in personal injury cases: request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries and</p>  <p>  - Improve the personal injuries litigation framework: through a number of measures, namely: </p>  <p>  - ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy; </p>  <p>-     tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and </p>  <p>-    ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.</p>  <p>  The fifth Quarterly Progress Update on implementation was published on 11 May and is available on the website of the Department of Finance. In respect of the actions from the Report due for completion in Q1 2018, all eight deadlines have been met.  </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all of the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group are implemented fully in order to drive the reforms listed above.  It is envisaged that the cumulative effect of the implementation of these recommendations, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and will also beneficially impact community, voluntary and charitable organisations across the country.</p></reply>

Zucman, T. T&oslash;rsl&oslash;v and L. Wier, that examines attribution of profits by mutlinationals around the world.</p><p>In the first instance, I reject any assertion that Ireland is a tax haven.  The report does not provide any definition of a tax haven and appears to assert that Ireland, and many other countries, are tax havens without providing a rationale for that assertion. </p><p>In the report, the authors appear to use the terms &quot;low-tax countries&quot; and &quot;tax havens&quot; interchangeably. The inference that Ireland is a tax haven simply because of our longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate is totally out of line with the long established position that a low corporate tax rate applied to a wide tax base is good economic policy for attracting investment and supporting economic growth. </p><p>The central analysis of the paper looks at links between level of profit booked in a country and the level of wages paid in a country.  This creates a totally misleading impression that corporate profits are or should be directly linked to wage levels rather than to the outputs of investment in all income generating activities such as investment in R&amp;amp;D, intangible assets, capital intensive machinery and investment in staff etc.</p><p>It is important to be very clear &ndash; corporation tax is paid where value is created not simply where companies have their highest wage bills.  It is therefore misleading to assert that profits are being artificially shifted by focusing on the ratio of profits to wages in each country.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime is designed to encourage the location of real, substantive and high-value adding investment in the country.  We do not apologise for having a competitive tax regime because we ensure that our overall regime is fully in line with international standards for fair tax competition as agreed at the EU and the OECD. </p><p>It is clear that the only way to ensure that the right tax is paid in the right place is to ensure that all tax authorities have access to all relevant information for assessing whether they are owed any tax.  This is why tax transparency and exchange of information among tax authorities is so vital.  </p><p>Ireland has continuously made changes to our tax legislation to ensure we meet all international best practices for exchange of tax information.  Last August, the Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information (an OECD led peer-review) awarded Ireland the highest international rating on tax transparency and exchange of information, one of only twenty two jurisdictions globally to be so rated following a new and enhanced peer review process.  </p><p>Ireland actively contributes towards preventing aggressive tax planning through the implementation of the OECD BEPS reports and the numerous EU Directives we have agreed on tax avoidance.  We continue to play our part in this ongoing work.  It is widely acknowledged that difficulties in the international tax system mainly arise from asymmetries between the taxation systems of different countries. Only by acting together can we ensure that companies are taxed appropriately. </p></reply>

The foregoing would suggest that contractors should have been taking wage inflation into account when tendering for construction contracts; public or private.  Indeed the SCSI tender price index would suggest that contractors have been taking wage inflation into account in pricing work.</p>  <p>  Circular 08/2018 was issued on 24 May 2018 through the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which sets out the amendments that have been undertaken to the CWMF to reflect the introduction of the SEOs in the construction sector.  These amendments will apply to tenders and contracts that are commenced after the periods set out in the circular and do not change the fixed price nature of the contracts.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement is commencing its engagement on the development of a Medium Term Strategy for the procurement of public works.  The Strategy will incorporate a broader review of the procurement of public works projects with a view to better manage risk generally and to ensure quality outcomes.  The engagement on the Strategy will involve all industry stakeholders and public bodies involved in the delivery of the public capital programme.</p></reply>

In relation to the PSSA, the measures agreed were given legal effect through the enactment of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.  The PSSA also makes provision for pay increases to be made to those public servants for whom FEMPI pay measures have already been unwound. </p><p>The cost of the PSSA Agreement in the years 2018-2020 is &euro;887m.  Carry over costs of &euro;227m associated with the final 2% pay increase in October 2020 fall in 2021.  In addition a further &euro;78m is required to complete FEMPI restoration for those public servants whose salary will not be fully restored (those on annualised remuneration greater than &euro;70,000) through the PSSA increases.  Under section 19 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act for those covered by the Agreement, these remaining amounts will be paid no later than July 2022.

The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch on 3<sup>rd</sup>May, 2018 of 29 flood risk management plans which propose118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW).  All of these projects are to be funded under the Government's 10 year flood risk investment programme of almost &euro;1 billion under the <i>National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>.  </p><p>As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country was also announced which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by local authorities.Aside from the 5 largest schemes and the 31 small or minor projects, the remaining projects in the initial phase of implementation were selected on the basis of those projects which would provide the greatest benefit in terms of the greatest number of properties protected on a regionally balanced basis.</p><p>A proposed flood relief scheme at Castlemartyr has been identified by the CFRAM programme to be progressed at a projected cost of &euro;1.4 million.  This proposed scheme  comprises the diversion of the Kiltha away from the village of Castlemartyr and construction of flood defence walls to protect properties to the south of the village which will protect 22 properties when completed. </p><p>The proposed scheme is not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed but the OPW and the local authority will work closely to ensure that it will be commenced as soon as possible within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p><p>Once consultants are appointed to progress the scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies as well as the general public takes place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme.</p></reply>

The first and only such pay increase to date is the 1% salary increase of 1 January 2018. The pension increases arising by reference to that salary increase are also due with effect from 1 January 2018, and are mostly confined to the pensions of persons who retired in the period from 1 March 2012 to 31 December 2017. </p>  <p>  Separate from the pension increases based on salary increases which are covered in the aforementioned circulars, public service pensions which at end-2017 stood reduced by the FEMPI-legislated &ldquo;Public Service Pension Reduction&rdquo; (PSPR), were entitled to an effective increase by way of lower PSPR with effect from 1 January 2018. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the large number of public service pension payroll managers in the diverse sectors of the public service to apply these pension increases.

It is open to Sligo County Council to undertake coastal erosion remedial works using its own resources. If necessary, it may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat. The Office of Public Works (OPW) operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications from local authorities are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. Full details are available on the OPW's website at: .</p><p>Sligo County Council applied for and was approved funding of &euro;40,500 and &euro;57,055 under this scheme in 2009 and 2015 respectively to carry out Coastal Erosion Risk Management Studies of Rosses Point,Co. Sligo.  All funding was drawn down following completion of the studies. </p><p>Sligo County Council has written to the OPW recently in relation to possible protection works or studies at a number of coastal locations including Rosses Point. The OPW will be responding to the Council indicating that it will need to prioritise the proposed works and, if appropriate, to submit specific applications for funding under the Minor Works scheme in relation to each one demonstrating that they meet the eligibility criteria of the scheme.  OPW staff are available to discuss the proposed works with the Council. There are currently no applications on hand under the Minor Works scheme for works at Rosses Point.</p></reply>

In relation to contracts closed within the previous five years, there is a risk that sharing information relating to the PSB and wider procurement process could have negative repercussions for the State, both in terms of managing the construction phase of the contract and in potentially influencing the price that future bidders for education projects might seek.

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  </p><p>Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.  </p><p>Notwithstanding that, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries (and caretakers) who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools  implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers).  </p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at: </p><p>Circular 0078/2017: <i></i></p><p>Circular 0079/2017: <i></i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator's recommendation applies.</p></reply>

The Review set out to ensure that the Scheme is achieving the best outcomes possible for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme was published by the NCSE on 30 May 2018 and contains 13 recommendations.  One of these recommendations is the development of a frontloaded model for allocating supports to schools for children with special educational needs who have additional care needs.</p>  <p>  My Department is developing proposals to implement the recommendations of the Review.  This will involve substantial engagement with key Departments and agencies as well as consultation with Education and Health Partners, Parent representatives and other stakeholders and developing proposals for early action on developing, on a pilot basis, a new allocation model and a national training programme.</p>  <p>  The SNA allocations for September 2018 have already been made as part of the normal applications process.  In order to meet the level of assessed demand, I announced on 18 May 2018 the provision of 800 additional Special Needs Assistant posts for allocation to schools for the beginning of the next school year, with a further 140 expected to be allocated over the period September to December 2018.  Accordingly there is no prospect of a new model being implemented from September 2018.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring children with special educational needs are given the opportunity to fulfil their potential is a key priority for this Government.  There will be 15,000 SNAs working in our schools by the end of the year, a 42% increase on 2011.  My Department's policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p></reply>

The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. </p>  <p>  In relation to school admissions, parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. It is the responsibility of the Board of Management to create and operate the enrolment policy for its school. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718500.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of the Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that an application for additional accommodation has been received from the patron of the school referred to in the details supplied. My Department is currently liaising with the patron in relation to the application and is awaiting receipt of additional information which the patron has undertaken to provide.

Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers within each sector. My Department is committed to supporting the increased registration of apprentices across all sectors.  New apprenticeship registrations have risen from 2,698 in 2014 to 4,843 in 2017, which represents an increase of almost 80%.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry. Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 eleven new apprenticeships have been developed in a wide range of sectors, including financial services, engineering, ICT and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway later in 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposals, I recently announced 26 new programmes for further development into national apprenticeships across a wide variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture. These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs of our economy.</p></reply>

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions Order) 2016 (S.I. No. 12 of 2016) commenced the bulk of the Act with effect from 18 January 2016.  That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 474 of 2017) commenced provisions of the Act relating to adoption by civil partners and cohabiting couples with effect from 2 November 2017. </p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015. </p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act, which related to adoption, was not commenced and was repealed by section 2(2) of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which came into operation on 19 October 2017, as provided for by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 443 of 2017). The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.  </p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act which amends section 2 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 has not yet been commenced. Following adoption of the 34th amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits. To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend section 177 to will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender. </p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  </p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  That Bill will provide for the establishment of an Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority which will, among other things, undertake certain functions under Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. </p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced and my Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.</p></reply>

There are no definite plans as yet for this strategic State asset but this is kept under review.  </p>  <p>  The Thornton Hall site comprising of 156 acres was purchased in 2005 for a proposed large scale prison campus to replace Mountjoy Prison which was to be sold to fund the development. Due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available and the project did not proceed.  Over the decade since the original plan, international research has tended towards smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation.  In addition, in light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years to upgrade accommodation and eliminate the practice of slopping out.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service now proposes to further develop the Mountjoy site through a Masterplan over the period 2021-2031 as referred to in the National Development Plan.  The aim is to bring the remainder of the prison up to an acceptable modern standard capable of serving needs into the future, including requirements for contemporary vehicular and emergency access, prisoner reception and discharge facilities, appropriate modern visitor facilities for families, much enhanced facilities for prisoner care and rehabilitation, indoor and outdoor recreation, healthcare, education and work/training, appropriate staff facilities, and improved wider service areas such as laundry and kitchen facilities.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while future plans for the Thornton site will be considered in the context of broader State requirements for land assets, plans in relation to the Prison estate continue to evolve and respond to changing requirements and practices in relation to detention of prisoners.</p></reply>

It is a response to calls by Member States, law enforcement agencies and industry for the regulation of this sector.  The publication of the Regulation and the Directive follows an extensive period of consultation by the Commission with Member States, industry and civil society.  </p>  <p>  The proposed Regulation introduces binding European Production and Preservation Orders.  Both orders are required to be issued by a judicial authority (a prosecutor or a judge).  An order can be issued to seek preservation or production of data that is stored by a service provider located in another jurisdiction.  Such orders may only be issued if a similar measure is available for the same criminal offence in a comparable domestic situation in an issuing State. </p>  <p>  The proposed Directive makes it mandatory for relevant service providers to designate a legal representative to receive and comply with orders issued under the proposed Regulation. </p>  <p>  The legal basis of the proposed Regulation is Article 82 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.  Article 82(1) provides that measures may be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure to lay down rules and procedures for ensuring recognition throughout the Union of all forms of judgments and judicial decisions. </p>  <p>  The legal basis of the proposed Directive is Articles 53 and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  As such, it is binding on all States, including Ireland, and there is no opt out facility afforded to Ireland where the Directive is concerned.   </p>  <p>  This proposed Regulation falls under "Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union".  The Regulation requires the approval of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.7 of the Constitution for Ireland to opt into it.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to seek the approval of Government to take the necessary measures to seek Oireachtas approval for Ireland to opt into the Regulation at a suitable juncture.</p></reply>

The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities, businesses (in particular the night-time economy) and other stakeholders to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. </p><p>I am, of course, aware of the introduction of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 in the U.K., which replaces 'traditional' ASBOs with an injunction (a civil order) and a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO).  I can assure the Deputy that officials in my Department keep all legislation under constant review and will also continue to monitor the implementation of the new measures adopted in the U.K.  Of course, if the Deputy has any specific proposals that he wishes to make in relation to ASBOs, or indeed the legislation governing them, I would be happy to examine them. </p><p>In setting up the ASBO regime in Ireland back in 2007, these interventions - warnings, good behaviour contracts and referrals to the Juvenile Diversion Programme - were intended to address the problem behaviour.  The rationale was that if they succeeded, there would be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  It was only if they failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question that a court order would then be applied for.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that the use of ASBOs is only suitable in certain circumstances and indeed it is only one crime prevention option open to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling this type of behaviour.  As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already employs a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour.  These measures are underpinned by a comprehensive legal framework.  Of course, addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Community Policing Model and a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard, including those under:</p><p>- the Criminal Damage Act 1991;</p><p>- Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;</p><p>- the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and </p><p>- the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p><p>While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle this problem head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone.  In relation to our young, it is up to us all, particularly the parents and guardians, to ensure that children are brought up to be respectful and law-abiding.  These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by society in general.  We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. </p><p>Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society.  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which <i>inter alia </i>supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.</p><p>Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To this end, the House will be aware that 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting recently.  The new recruits are visible proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 including 15,000 Garda members.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of personnel under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Limerick Division was 565.  There are also 27 Garda Reserves and 53 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just over 1,960 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 63 members have been assigned to the Limerick Division, 10 of whom were allocated from the latest attestation on the 15 June 2018. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 400 of whom have attested to date.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June. </p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the Limerick Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in tabular form the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to each Garda District in each of the years 2007 to 2017 and  as of 30 April 2018 the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th colspan="13">Strength of the Limerick Division by District 2007-2018</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2007</td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td><td>2018*</td></tr><tr><td>Bruff</td><td>41</td><td>45</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>46</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>43</td><td>41</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Henry Street</td><td>330</td><td>358</td><td>363</td><td>376</td><td>363</td><td>341</td><td>329</td><td>314</td><td>311</td><td>317</td><td>313</td><td>309</td></tr><tr><td>Newcastle West</td><td>47</td><td>49</td><td>47</td><td>44</td><td>45</td><td>43</td><td>81</td><td>78</td><td>75</td><td>74</td><td>75</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Roxboro Road</td><td>134</td><td>139</td><td>141</td><td>140</td><td>148</td><td>137</td><td>134</td><td>129</td><td>124</td><td>125</td><td>129</td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>Askeaton</td><td>41</td><td>44</td><td>40</td><td>39</td><td>37</td><td>38</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>593</td><td>635</td><td>635</td><td>643</td><td>637</td><td>605</td><td>589</td><td>565</td><td>554</td><td>559</td><td>558</td><td>565<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 30 April 2018.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division, which ensures local Garda management has the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational needs and address critical issues as they arise taking account of, amongst other factors, the incidence of crime and crime trends in each District in the Division.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware Caherciveen forms part of the Killarney Garda District.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that Caherciveen Garda Station operates on a 24-hour basis, during which it is open to the public from 9am to 5pm Monday to Sunday.</p>  <p>  I am informed that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available the strength of the District was 107, including one Superintendent District officer based in District Headquarters, in Killarney Garda Station, and 18 Garda&iacute; assigned to Caherciveen Garda Station</p>  <p>  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  The Government's Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.  Indeed in the period 2013 to the end of 2017, almost &euro;44 million has been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period to assist Garda&iacute; in being mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p>  <p>  I am informed that there are currently 2 Garda vehicles attached to Caherciveen Garda Station.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the Southern Region is to be allocated 30 Garda vehicles in 2018, with 5 of these vehicles intended to be allocated to the Kerry Division.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda District, including the Killarney District as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Sligo/Leitrim Division on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 302 of whom 4 were allocated to the Divisional Drug Unit.  There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Sligo/Leitrim Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the Commissioner, established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GDOCB), which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime, as it currently exists in this country. </p>  <p>  The GDOCB leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.  This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  I am informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide. </p>  <p>  We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. </p>  <p>  Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just over 1,960 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources he needs to allow him to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.</p>  <p>  I have requested from the Garda Commissioner the specific information sought by the Deputy regarding the number of vehicles  and I will write to him on receipt of same.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner's final report on the matter, which is available on my Department's website, recommends that Stepaside Garda Station be reopened, along with stations in Bawnboy, Co.

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities, particularly in the Summer months.</p>  <p>  I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents of anti-social behaviour.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close contact with local and senior management in Irish Rail and other transport providers. Garda&iacute; also have a good working relationship with the public transport services providers and patrols of uniformed and plain-clothes Garda&iacute;, including personnel on foot patrols and other community engagement duties, are routinely employed when deemed appropriate by Garda management.</p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle this problem head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone.  In relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding.  These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by society in general.  We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Cohort model of resource allocation has been in use by Garda management since 2015 and is currently the model utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer garda&iacute; from the Garda College.  The model is a dynamic distribution model and aims to impose a numerical/mathematical measure on the policing needs of each Division nationwide.  The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel, is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues.  When allocation of resources is under review, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all relevant factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p>  <p>  In relation to the allocation of newly attested garda&iacute;, it has to be factored in that they have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. </p></reply>

The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational law enforcement actions.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Oversight Group of the Task Force is chaired jointly at senior management level by the two police services in order to provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  This group also includes senior personnel from relevant agencies.</p>  <p>  Senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland jointly chair the Operations Co-ordination Group, which is bringing forward the operational actions in six priority areas that have been the focus of the work of the task force: Rural Crime; Immigration-related Crime; Excise Fraud; Drugs; Financial Crime and Human Trafficking. These priorities are, of course, kept under review. There has been very considerable operational activity, with a variety of different operations undertaken across all of the priority areas since the establishment of the Task Force. I commend the efforts of all of the agencies involved in this important work.</p>  <p>  As the Joint Agency Task Force is a multi-agency co-ordination structure it does not have a defined staffing complement or budget.

It is also an offence for a person to give false or misleading instructions or information to a solicitor or expert in relation to a personal injuries action or to cause false or misleading instructions or information to be given with the intention of misleading the court.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide information with regard to the number of convictions arising under section 25 of the Act.  I have requested the Courts Service to examine the requirements, including system development and resource issues, needed to enable the compiling of such statistics going forward.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that the issue of fraud in the personal injuries litigation area is being examined as part of the ongoing work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, and an initial roundtable was convened by the Department of Finance in late 2017 to listen to the views of all of the key stakeholders in relation to insurance fraud.  In January 2018, the Working Group produced its &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance&rsquo; which includes a number of specific recommendations in relation to the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the Working Group's employer and public liability insurance report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims.  While guidelines were published in 2004, the Working Group noted that these have only been used to a very limited extent over the years and proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 protocol as a starting point.  Consultations with various interested parties on the proposed guidelines have taken place and it is anticipated that a new set of guidelines will be completed during Quarter 3 2018. </p>  <p>  It should be noted also that the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaging with my Department on an ongoing basis in relation to the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that the Department of Finance issues regular quarterly updates on its website of the progress of the respective reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, the latest and Fifth Quarterly Progress Update having been published on 11 May 2018.  </p></reply>

Specifically, this involves considering the feasibility of establishing a specialised and dedicated insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, funded by industry.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) has engaged with Insurance Ireland, submitting a mechanism for further co-operation and a costed proposal to Insurance Ireland in the latter half of 2017. Insurance Ireland has agreed to explore the proposal further, subject to a full cost benefit analysis, to be carried out by Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officers Working Group. The intention would be that such a dedicated Garda unit would be funded by Insurance Ireland members and non-members alike, i.e. all entities writing non-life insurance business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Further progress on this recommendation is dependent upon the outcome of this cost benefit analysis, which is currently awaited. As I have previously informed the House, Insurance Ireland has indicated that it expects to be in a position to provide an update in this regard by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  Any proposed agreed mechanism will, of course, ultimately be subject to the approval of the Garda Commissioner and myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

The intention is not to interfere with the discretion of the courts to deal with cases appropriately but to assist in enhancing the effectiveness of the statutory requirement for a plaintiff to serve a notice in writing on the defendant stating the nature of the wrong alleged to have been committed by him or her.</p>  <p>  Among the amendments recommended to be made to section 8 is a reduction from two months to one month in the statutory time period for a plaintiff in a personal injuries action to serve a notice in writing on the alleged wrongdoer stating the nature of the wrong alleged to have been committed by him or her.  In the view of the Working Group, this may be justified by way of being in alignment with data protection legislation which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained.  This is relevant for personal injuries cases where CCTV may have captured relevant footage.  Generally, the retention period for data protection purposes is one month, beyond which retention is only permitted in certain circumstances, including for example, in the context of an investigation.</p>  <p>  In keeping with the relevant recommendations and timelines of the Working Group the relevant amendments to section 8 are under preparation at my Department so that a suitable legislative vehicle can be availed of for their timely introduction and enactment.</p></reply>

This is, of course, an issue which has been the subject of particular debate in relation to the insurance sector where so-called &ldquo;claims harvesting&rdquo; companies have been in operation and may be considered to have an undesirable impact on the levels of litigation and costs in that sector. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy&rsquo;s specific concerns are about those companies or firms which specialise in managing or harvesting insurance claims, their regulation will be a matter for appropriate consideration in the context of insurance regulation under the policy aegis of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  For my part, therefore, I would have no specific plans to bring forward legislation to regulate claims management companies in that context at this time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, this is an issue which has been considered in the context of the ongoing work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance Michael D'Arcy TD, which is undertaking a review of the factors which are influencing the increased cost of insurance, and brings together all the relevant Departments and Offices involved including my own Department.  </p>  <p>  As part of that work, the Working Group sought the views of the Law Society on the matter of claims harvesting and those preventative measures contained in the Solicitors Acts which are of relevance.  In the first instance, section 62 of the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business and provides that any such agreement is void.  The Law Society informed the Working Group of its continued proactive approach to breaches of section 62 and has published an updated practice note on claims referrals and section 62 in June 2017 by way of ensuring that the solicitors&rsquo; profession is fully informed.  The Law Society has also directly notified claims referral companies found to be targeting solicitors about the statutory prohibition on solicitors paying referral fees.</p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 also generally prohibits unqualified persons from advertising a service of a legal nature that could otherwise be provided by a solicitor for a fee or reward.  This includes advertising in relation to personal injuries claims in the context of claims harvesting websites.  The Law Society has informed the Working Group that 14 claims harvesting websites have been taken down as a result of the Law Society&rsquo;s investigations since 2014.  The Law Society has also instituted High Court proceedings against non-solicitors relating to two leading claims harvesting websites one of which resulted in a High Court order directing its permanent closure.  The Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, which was published in January 2018 and is available on the website of the Department of Finance, refers.</p>  <p>  In so far, therefore, as claims management companies are seeking to directly or indirectly engage solicitors in their claims work, the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2015 are being used as a bulwark against &ldquo;claims harvesting&rdquo; and the relevant regulatory and disciplinary provisions under the Acts are being applied rigorously by the Law Society.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, these are matters which I expect will be taken up by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority in the ongoing roll-out of its functions including of the new public complaints framework and of the new Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal which are scheduled to take place early in 2019.  Along with my Department I will, of course, continue to support the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group including, as appropriate, in relation to those specific matters which have been raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

While legislation has a role to play in curbing the resale of tickets at inflated prices, sporting bodies, artists and promoters also have a responsibility to address the issue. I am encouraged by the fact that the level of ticket resale for a number of recent major entertainment events, and the prices paid on the secondary ticket market for tickets to those events, have both been relatively low due to factors such as the use of personalised or paperless tickets and the decision of some acts to put on sufficient shows to meet the demand for tickets.  </p></reply>

This data is collated on a national basis only. Information on the value of investments made by IDA client companies in Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) is therefore unavailable.  However, the value of investments is reflected in the number of jobs created across the country. I am pleased to say that the level of investment by IDA client companies in counties Louth, Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Westmeath remains strong with 19,533 people employed in 104 FDI companies. </p><p>It should also be emphasised that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. Enterprise Ireland supported companies continue to perform well in the regions with all five counties reporting increases in job numbers. In 2017, a 7% increase was reported in Westmeath, with a 5% increase reported in Meath, Louth and Kildare and a 4% increase reported in Wicklow.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland does not conduct site visits.  Data on IDA Ireland site visits and jobs are collated on a county-by-county basis only and details on site visits in Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Westmeath and Louth from 2013 to Q1 2018 are outlined in Table C. IDA Ireland continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in all counties of Ireland to its client base. It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  </p><p>Tables A and B provide a breakdown of employment by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies in counties Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Westmeath and Louth from 2013 to 2017.  The employment figures for 2018 will not be available until my Department's Annual Employment Survey is carried out in November 2018.</p><p><b>Table A: Total employment of EI-supported companies in Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Westmeath and Louth 2013-2017</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>6,520</td><td>7,512</td><td>8,308</td><td>8,632</td><td>9,134</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>6,072</td><td>6,658</td><td>6,855</td><td>7,007</td><td>7,302</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>3,622</td><td>3,628</td><td>3,903</td><td>4,104</td><td>4,132</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,854</td><td>3,436</td><td>3,548</td><td>3,653</td><td>3,741</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>5,032</td><td>5,434</td><td>5,600</td><td>5,819</td><td>6,121</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table B: Total employment of IDA-supported companies in Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Westmeath and Louth 2013-2017</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>10,327</td><td>10,285</td><td>10,628</td><td>10,229</td><td>9,282</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>2,568</td><td>3,053</td><td>3,236</td><td>3,593</td><td>3,702</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,540</td><td>1,536</td><td>1,533</td><td>1,526</td><td>1,491</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,202</td><td>2,386</td><td>2,519</td><td>2,573</td><td>2,794</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,348</td><td>2,324</td><td>2,199</td><td>2,234</td><td>2,264</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table C: IDA site visits in Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Westmeath and Louth 2013-Q1 2018</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>Q1 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>28</td><td>36</td><td>42</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>22</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This included a Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter the &ldquo;Copyright Directive&rdquo;). The intention of the Directive is to craft modern copyright legislation suitable for all European citizens. Among the Directive&rsquo;s many proposals are provisions aimed at ensuring greater rights for press publishers seeking to protect their content online (Article 11), and intended to address the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo;, whereby rights-holders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have been thoroughly engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal and have been successful in achieving a number of amendments to address the concerns of our stakeholders. On 25 May, the Copyright Directive was discussed by Ambassadors at COREPER and the Presidency gained approval for a mandate to commence negotiations with the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Negotiations on the Copyright Directive have been exhaustive and while I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, I fully support the intention of this proposal which is vitally important to both the DSM and the digital economy. Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rights-holders, and citizens. To that end, there has been extensive engagement with stakeholders across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage positively with the negotiations on the proposal going forward to ensure that Ireland can benefit from its many merits as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While I very much regret this news, I welcome Coca Cola's stated commitment to making every effort to help those employees who will lose their jobs. This includes redundancy packages, as well as financial advice and re-training. Despite this disappointing decision, Coca-Cola has made it clear that it remains fully committed to its other facilities in Ireland. We understand more than half of the jobs that will be lost in Athy will transfer to its facility in Ballina, County Mayo.</p>  <p>  The Government will also make every State support available to those impacted. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is aware of the situation and we will be working collectively, across Government, to help these workers transition and find new employment opportunities. The IDA is engaging closely with senior management at Coca-Cola Ireland and I met last week with stakeholders in Athy, including local representatives, to discuss the issue. </p>  <p>  This meeting was a useful opportunity to hear first-hand the impact that this announcement will have on Athy and the surrounding area as well as specific challenges Athy faces. At the meeting, I reiterated the Government's commitment to work towards bringing regional unemployment to within one percentage point of the national average. I am pleased that the Mid-East, as a region, is currently performing very strongly on that measure with an unemployment figure of 5.2% at the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  The Government's role is to ensure that the right conditions are in place to allow enterprise to thrive. I was glad to see that everyone around the table in Athy &ndash; TDs, Councillors, the Local Authority, and local businesses &ndash; are committed to a collaborative approach to drive enterprise in the region. </p>  <p>  From the Government's part, and to back the ambition and potential of all regions, I announced in April the opening of the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) which is worth &euro;30 million. </p>  <p>  Under the first round of the Regional Fund, the Co. Kildare Community Network Company secured significant funding to develop a Mid-East Regional Innovation 'Think-Space' to be located in Naas which will be a great support to start-ups and businesses emerging in Kildare and the wider Mid-East. Also, IT Carlow was successful in securing funding for the Insurtech Network Centre, which again will be an important asset to the Carlow/South Kildare area. </p>  <p>  I want to see more successful projects from this Region under the second call of REDF. In addition, under Project Ireland 2040, the Government will continue to make this funding available on a rolling basis. </p>  <p>  The support of the National Development Plan over coming years will be crucial to delivering on regional development potential, where three quarters of new growth is envisioned for places outside of Dublin by 2040. The Government recently launched four Funds under Project Ireland 2040 which will also help to ensure more balanced regional development and will stimulate renewal and investment in rural and urban areas, the environment and innovation. In particular, the &euro;1 billion Rural Development Fund will support job creation in rural areas, address de-population of rural communities and support improvements in our towns, villages and their hinterlands that enhance the quality of life of communities and enhance their attractiveness for families who want to live and work there.  A collaborative mindset along with the Regional Action Plans will be important mechanisms to ensure this funding will be targeted in the right areas. </p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient's symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.</p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to the patient and recoup this amount from the GP. The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 provides for the creation of an offence of FGM and other offences relating to FGM.  The legislation takes a human rights perspective and stipulates that the right to practice one's cultural traditions and beliefs cannot be used to justify FGM. </p>  <p>  The HSE is working to raise awareness of the health implications of FGM among at risk communities through staff information and support. An FGM resource pack for health professionals and relevant staff in maternity and associated settings has been disseminated.  The HSE provides funding to AkiDwA, a national network of migrant women, to facilitate working with target communities around raising awareness of the illegality of FGM and sharing information about the risks of this practice. In addition, the HSE funds a specialist clinic operated by the Irish Family Planning Association for girls and women who have undergone FGM.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of NGOs to discuss how their work on FGM can be supported by Government departments and agencies. The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work with relevant departments and with AkiDwA to improve health outcomes for groups vulnerable to this form of gender-based violence. In this regard, the HSE intends to include FGM in its forthcoming intercultural health strategy.</p>  <p>  I understand that the monitoring committee for the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence has recently agreed that the strategy will include an action relating to FGM. This strategy comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

The medicine has conditional market authorisation from the European Medicines Agency for Europe - (the condition being that the company carries out further clinical trials to determine the clinical efficacy of the drug). </p>  <p>  Applications for reimbursement were considered by the HSE Drugs Committee and Leadership Team in 2016 and 2017.  The applications were considered carefully, however the final decision was that the HSE was not in a position to fund the medicine on the basis of the current clinical evidence of effectiveness and the prices being charged by the pharmaceutical company.</p>  <p>  The HSE informed the applicant company of this decision, in keeping with the requirements of the 2013 Act. The applicant has appealed the HSE&rsquo;s decision to the High Court, which is part of the statutory process under Section 27 of the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has informed the company that any new information it may have in relation to clinical benefits or evidence (or in relation to price) can be considered as part of a new application.  The HSE has confirmed that there will also be no delay in bringing such an application to a speedy conclusion and decision stage.</p></reply>

They currently support 150 families with a person with autism in the Inishowen region, many of whom have been referred to them by the HSE, although without funding. </p><p>iCare receives minimal state funding. HSE briefing indicated that iCare received &euro;75,523 in funding in 2017 but iCare said that this is money the HSE pays through iCare to a landlord for the rental of a facility &ndash; iCare merely pay out the money but get no benefit from it.  The HSE Disability Manager CHO1, Jacinta Lyons, undertook to investigate this.  The other state funding received is Lottery funding - &euro;2k in 2017.</p><p>Services provided by iCare and primarily community support and day respite &ndash; approximately 2 hours a day for 25 children, and another 2 hours a day for over 18s.  They also provide services at weekends and summer holidays, including nights away.</p><p>iCare is looking for two things:</p><p>- A SLA with the HSE providing funding of &euro;100,000 per annum to cover the services it provides to families with autism in the area;</p><p>- Capital investment from the HSE to build a permanent centre on land that it has purchased. The operation is currently running out of two pre-fabs which are nearing the end of their usable life</p><p>iCare had previously submitted a business case for ongoing funding but it was turned down.  They have submitted a new case as part of the 2018 estimates; this has been escalated to HSE National level.</p><p>The submission for capital funding needs to be submitted through the CHO.  The Disability Manager supports the work of the organisation and will assist with the application.</p><p>The Minister undertook to follow up with the HSE regarding service planning and said that he and/or Minister McGrath may visit the facility when they are next in Donegal.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of this policy is to show through a series of demonstrator projects how a critical mass of Advance Nurse Practitioners (ANP) can contribute to providing a solution to a number of challenges facing the health service including access to services, avoiding unnecessary hospital attendance, supporting early discharge and contributing to addressing waiting lists. </p>  <p>  The first 120 ANP commenced the programme in October 2017 and a further 30 will commence in October 2018.  The selection criterion for nurses to be appointed to this programme are clearly set out in the letters requesting expression of interest.  The ANP programme is one of many initiatives to enhance the educational qualifications and improve career paths of nurses.</p>  <p>  I understand that one ANP post was assigned to the hospital mentioned by the Deputy in 2017 as part of the central ANP programme.  However it is important to note that this central ANP programme is only one pathway to becoming an ANP.  One of the benefits of the programme is that in recognising the importance and benefits of having ANPs on their staff, approval to attend ANP or equivalent courses can be give at CHO or Hospital Group level provided costs can be met from within their existing resources. </p></reply>

The Children's Hospital Group committed to a two-year service development plan to implement an orthopaedic service that provides timely access for Outpatient and In-Patient services. The HSE has confirmed that as part of this plan it will maintain the 4-month target in 2018 and beyond, which is international best practice, for all patients who are clinically deemed to require surgery now.</p>  <p>  In addition, a Paediatric Scoliosis Services Co-Design group is in place, which includes clinicians, hospital staff and representatives from the scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive, contemporary, and patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, two new consultant posts for paediatric orthopaedics have been provided in the HSE 2018 National Service Plan. The two new posts are currently being processed through the Consultant Appointment Approval Committee process and are expected to be appointed in quarter 4 of 2018.

Two changes were made to the schedule with the introduction of Meningococcal B (Men B) and Rotavirus immunisation for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  As the first doses of these vaccines are administered to children when they reach two months, these changes  took effect from 1 December, 2016.  There are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p>  <p>  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme. </p></reply>

An additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE in 2018 specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including further increasing access to scoliosis services. The Children's Hospital Group is committed to a two-year service development plan to implement an orthopaedic service that provides timely access for Outpatient and In-Patient services. The HSE has confirmed that as part of this plan it will maintain the 4-month target in 2018 and beyond, which is international best practice, for all patients who are clinically deemed to require surgery now.</p>  <p>  In addition, a Paediatric Scoliosis Services Co-Design group is in place, which includes clinicians, hospital staff and representatives from the scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive, contemporary, and patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, two new consultant posts for paediatric orthopaedics have been provided for in the HSE 2018 National Service Plan.

While the Inpatient and Day Case (IPDC) Action Plan was published in April to address waiting times for IPDC procedures, the Outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge to be addressed in 2018. </p>  <p>  Each year, 3.3 million patients attend Hospital Outpatient clinics for appointments. The HSE has commenced the development of an Outpatient Department Action Plan for 2018. The HSE will work with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the Department of Health to finalise a joint plan focused on improving overall use of resources and ensuring timely access to treatment and care for our patients.</p>  <p>  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) continues to work with the NTPF to manage long waiting lists for clinically appropriate groups, and with the HSE&rsquo;s Acute Hospital Division to secure year on year investment in critical pressure areas. Capacity challenges are managed daily with each of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals supporting each other in terms of bed utilisation and availability. </p>  <p>  Part of the rationale for the development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital is the challenges with existing physical infrastructure across the hospitals in the Group. The design of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and Paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centres at Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals is based on a thorough analysis of capacity and demand and services will be provided in line with best practice and the National Model of Care for Paediatrics and Neonatology, the acute strand of the HSE&rsquo;s Integrated Care Programme for Children. </p></reply>

The intense efforts of 2017 primarily focused on addressing legacy issues. This involved the introduction of a number of short-term measures, including the outsourcing of surgeries abroad.  </p><p>As part of the outsourcing initiative 46 surgeries were performed in 2017 at Cappagh and the Mater Hospitals, Stanmore and Portland Hospitals in the UK and St Franziskus Hospital in Germany.  For those patients and their families who opted for overseas treatment, they have had a positive outcome and experience. These contracts are still in place between the HSE and the outsourcing hospitals for 2018.</p><p>In addition to outsourcing surgeries to specialist centres in the UK and Europe, other initiatives introduced resulted in an increase in public capacity in terms of additional theatre sessions at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin (Crumlin), Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital (Cappagh) and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (Mater).  </p><p>In 2017, 22 patients opted to remain on the Crumlin list with their treating consultant rather than taking up offers of other treatment options in Ireland and overseas.  Some of these patients have now had their surgery and others are continuously under review in relation to a plan.While no families have availed of the offer for treatment outside of Ireland thus far in 2018, Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin will be contacting families within the coming week to offer them outsourcing in the UK and Germany. </p><p>  The Children's Hospital Group (CHG) advise that their focus for 2018 is on reducing the backlog and the unacceptable waiting times for children and young people and ensuring that those patients, who require surgery, receive it. The CHG's plan for the year ahead in partnership with the clinicians and all other stakeholders is to drive further progress in reducing waiting times by developing a long term sustainable and safe paediatric model of care for paediatric orthopaedic services which will ensure that clinical criteria will determine the timeframe for the delivery of care.</p><p>In relation to the issuing of letters to patients, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly. </p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p><p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p><p>I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

Management were already engaged with the Psychiatric Nurses Association concerning limited action it commenced in December 2017 in relation to capacity issues at the hospital.</p>  <p>  In April, SIPTU indicated to management through the Workplace Relations Commission that they were concerned with the level of overcrowding, believing it impacts on patient safety. </p>  <p>  Since then, local management have introduced several measures to address the issues raised by the staff associations. These measures include: the provision of additional nursing staff resources when overcapacity arises; daily communication of in-patient activity and weekly &ldquo;bed management&rdquo; meetings.  Regular delayed discharge meetings are held and measures taken to progress patient discharges.  In order to address any potential risks a quality and patient safety committee has been established to deal with any risks highlighted in a positive, solution focussed and timely manner. </p>  <p>  A dedicated recruitment campaign for CHO 5 commenced on the 28th May to source additional staff.  For the longer term, work has commenced to include the development of two new units in the HSE Capital Plan. </p>  <p>  It is hoped that these measures will go some way to address the concerns raised by the unions.  While SIPTU have served notice of industrial action to commence on 26th June, local management remain actively engaged with the staff associations with a view to averting the proposed action.  I have requested the management of CHO 5 to attend a meeting on Tuesday to up date me on progress on this issue.</p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines.  The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) are currently undergoing a full pharmacoeconomic assessment by the NCPE.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  This statutory based scheme replaced the Nursing Home Subvention which had been in existence since 1993.  Any person who was supported in a private nursing home before the commencement of the NHSS in October 2009 could choose to transfer to the NHSS or retain their existing subvention arrangements.  Any person who was in a public or voluntary nursing home or in a contracted bed in a private nursing home before the commencement of the NHSS could also continue with their existing arrangements.  The National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme states that nothing in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 or in the National Guidelines shall operate in a way that diminishes the overall financial position of an applicant in receipt of Nursing Home Subvention, or who is currently in a public nursing home bed, including contract beds.</p>  <p>  The rules for qualifying for a subvention were that the person must be sufficiently dependent to need nursing home care and be unable to pay any or part of the cost of care in the home.  This involved a means test.</p>  <p>  No new applications for the subvention scheme were accepted after the introduction of the NHSS on 27 October 2009 when the maximum weekly subvention rate was &euro;300.  There are no plans to increase the State Subvention rate in the 2019 budget.  Subvention rates continue to be paid from the total NHSS budget which in 2018 is &euro;962 million.</p></reply>

Poultry litter containing residual poultry carcases must be disposed of in an incineration plant approved by this Department or the EPA or in a rendering plant also approved by the Department.  However, as poultry litter that does not contain residual poultry carcases is considered to be an organic fertilizer/soil improver and is a valuable source of nutrients for farmers, it can be disposed of by spreading on land subject to strict conditions.  The other main disposal routes for this material is in composting and biogas plants or as a fuel for combustion.  </p><p>Poultry litter must be transported by a haulier registered with the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine  in accordance with Regulation No. (EC) 1069 of 2009 and must be accompanied by a commercial document that provides details of the place of origin of the material and place of destination of the material.  The material must be transported in covered, leak-proof containers or vehicles which are maintained in a clean condition with signage stating  &quot;Category 2 Material - Manure&quot;</p><p>Poultry manure must be spread without delay and, where in the event that the material  is being held for a short time prior to land-spreading, it must be stacked on a concrete base away from rivers, streams and other water courses and any run-off must be collected. </p><p>The Department has issued Good Practice Guidelines for poultry farmers, for poultry litter hauliers and for the end-users of poultry litter to ensure each stakeholder is aware of their legal obligations for the  transport, use and disposal of the material.  </p><p>The codes  good practice for poultry farmers, poultry litter hauliers and end-users of poultry litter can be found on the DAFM website at</p><p><i>www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/diseasecontrol/botulism/.</i></p></reply>

However, from an industry perspective it is of benefit that suspect cases of botulism are reported to my Department in order that the incidence and extent of outbreaks may be monitored. DAFM veterinary laboratories are available to assist in diagnosis and to rule out other diseases which can present in a similar manner to botulism.  Suspect cases may be reported by the herd owner's private veterinary practitioner to the Regional Veterinary Laboratory or the nearest Regional Veterinary Office (RVO).</p><p>Botulism outbreaks in cattle are most commonly, but not exclusively, associated with exposure to contaminated poultry litter &ndash; often coinciding with the recent spreading of poultry litter on land when the management of poultry litter is poor or deficient.  Cattle grazing these contaminated pastures or coming into contact directly or indirectly with poultry litter are at risk of contracting the disease.  </p><p>As part of controls on the poultry sector, my Department carries out certain inspections of poultry units to monitor compliance with the requirements of the Animal By-Products (ABP) Regulations as they relate to the proper disposal of dead poultry and the disposal of manure.  Poultry producers are required to ensure that litter does not contain any residual poultry carcases.  Transporters of poultry litter/manure are required to be registered as ABP transporters with the Department.  Transporters must keep records, including the details of the place of origin of the material they are transporting and the place of destination. </p><p>My Department may also undertake follow-up investigations in situations where poultry litter is suspected of being the source of a botulism outbreak to ensure that adequate measures are being taken to prevent outbreaks - on the farm where the poultry litter is being spread, by the poultry litter haulier and on the poultry units that supplied the poultry litter.</p><p>The Department has drawn up Codes of Good Practice for poultry farmers, poultry litter hauliers and end-users of poultry litter, providing advice in relation to the management, transport and use of poultry litter in order to minimise the risks of contamination of pasture to cattle on the end user&rsquo;s farm and neighbouring farms.  These and other information in relation to botulism are available on the DAFM website at this link: <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/diseasecontrol/botulism/.</i></p><p>I would particularly encourage all farmers handling or spreading poultry litter to advise their neighbours of the fact so that they can move cattle that may be susceptible to fields that are not adjacent to the handling/spreading area.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie,</i>which shows those areas that will be served by commercial operators and those that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.  This includes approximately 300,000 premises to be passed as part of eir's rural deployment of high speed broadband as part of the Commitment Agreement signed in April 2017.  As of Q1 2018 circa 145,000 of those committed premises had been passed.</p><p>The NBP State led Intervention covers 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s land mass, traversing 26 counties and including some 542,000 premises.  These premises are coloured AMBER on the Map and are part of an ongoing procurement process.  The formal procurement process to engage a company who will roll out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area is now in its final stages.  The successful bidder will deploy and operate this State intervention network for the next 25 years.  </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website at<i>www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/communications/topics/Broadband/national-broadband-plan/latest-news/Pages/Broadband-Officers-Workshop.aspx.</i></p></reply>

However, the levy does not apply to plastic bags designed for re-use which are used to contain goods or products and which are sold to customers for a sum of not less than 70 cents each.</p><p>The introduction of the levy in March 2002 led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags supplied to consumers, from an estimated 328 bags per person per year prior to the introduction of the levy, to 21 bags per person by the end of 2002, and a further reduction to an estimated 8 bags per person by the end of 2016.</p><p>My Department monitors the receipts from the plastic bag levy to gauge trends in the average per capita consumption of single-use plastic bags.  This data is used to ensure that the plastic bag levy is set at an appropriate level.  <i>The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Report 2016</i>reports that plastic bags constituted 0.23% of litter arising in 2016.  This compares with 5% prior to the levy&rsquo;s introduction. </p><p>Receipts from the plastic bag levy for each year are published in the Environment Fund Annual Accounts.  The 2017 Annual Accounts will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website after they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, while copies of the Annual Accounts, up to and including 2016, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblink: </p><p><i>www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/environmental-protection-and-awareness/environmental-fund/Pages/default.aspx.</i></p><p>I very much welcome the more sustainable practices resulting from the introduction of the plastic bag levy, and its very positive impact on litter and on our environment generally.  Indeed, Ireland is often cited internationally as an example to others in this regard and the amendment to the EU Packaging Directive, which seeks to reduce the usage of plastic bags across the EU, was informed by the positive Irish experience.</p></reply>

The programme concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area. The primary use of the data is in improved charting for safer shipping, offshore environmental protection, fishing, aquaculture, marine planning, offshore renewable energy, marine tourism and marine development.  The data is also used to a very limited extent by the oil and gas sector.  The programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS).  The combined costs of both of these seabed mapping programmes since 1995 is &euro;78.5 million.  An external independent evaluation indicated the return across all sectors to be more than four times the costs incurred.  In respect of petroleum related surveys, these are primarily undertaken by exploration companies.  However, since 1995 my Department has initiated and funded at a total cost of &euro;7.4 million a seismic survey and a bathymetric survey for the purposes of the delineation of the Irish continental shelf, and a regional seismic acquisition programme over Ireland's major Atlantic basins   to complement existing datasets and to fill data gaps. </p></reply>

This event, which will also be attended by An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar TD, and other members of the Cabinet, will have the theme of Empowering Communities for Climate Action.  The event is being organised by my Department.</p>  <p>  Recognising the key role of communities as enablers and drivers of the low carbon transition in society, this event will include two panel discussions exploring how to engage society with climate change and how, once engaged with the challenge, citizens can be empowered to act, focusing especially on the role of Government expenditure policy, taxation measures and regulation in underpinning climate action.  These panel discussions will, in turn,  further inform the development of initiatives under the National Dialogue on Climate Action, with the first Regional Gathering under the National Dialogue scheduled to take place on 23 June in Athlone.</p>  <p>  Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action in the next decade.  Reflecting the strong commitment of the Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society.  In addition, the national development plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.  This means that well over &euro;1 in every &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the period to 2030. </p>  <p>  The key investment priorities in the national development plan that my Department will take forward include:</p>  <p>  - ​energy efficiency upgrades of 45,000 homes per annum from 2021 and providing support for a major roll-out of heat pump technologies; </p>  <p>  - delivering energy upgrades to BER 'B' level in all public buildings and a minimum of one third of commercial buildings; </p>  <p>  - implementing the new renewable electricity support scheme to deliver an additional 3,000-4,500 MW of renewable energy, with the initial focus on shovel ready projects which could contribute to meeting our 2020 targets; </p>  <p>  - the roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat and national smart metering programme; </p>  <p>  - transitioning the Moneypoint plant away from coal by the middle of the next decade; </p>  <p>  - having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 with additional charging infrastructure to cater for planned growth; and </p>  <p>  - a &euro;500 million climate action fund, under which I will shortly open applications for funding, to leverage investment by public and private bodies in climate action measures.</p>  <p>  Both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan explicitly recognise that the reliance solely on Exchequer expenditure schemes is neither affordable nor adequate to meet the scale of the challenge to be addressed, and that climate mitigation action will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change. </p>  <p>  In certain cases, taxation policy may have a stronger role to play in changing individual or business behaviour and investment decisions, including harnessing non-Exchequer finance.  Carbon tax, in particular, has a critical role in climate mitigation policy and the national mitigation plan commits the Department of Finance to completing a review in 2018, with a view to setting a long-term trajectory for the evolution of this tax.  Clear long-term signalling by the Government on the future evolution of the tax is vital, as well as an examination of what other changes to the taxation regime could be considered that would assist with the achievement of climate targets.  The low emission vehicle task force is bringing forward proposals in this regard.</p>  <p>  As regards significant regulatory change, the National Development Plan commits the Government to no new non-zero emission cars to be sold in Ireland post-2030, with no NCT certificates to be issued for non-zero emission cars post-2045.  There is also to be a transition to a low emission urban bus fleet, including electric buses, with no diesel only buses purchased from 1 July 2019.</p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing climate mitigation policy development, the European Union requires that we produce a draft National Energy and Climate Plan by the end of 2018, with the final plan to be developed by the end of 2019.  This represents a further opportunity to build on the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan to ensure Ireland moves to a pathway of long-term decarbonisation.  Furthermore, as well as the ongoing development of the National Mitigation Plan as a living document, I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years.  The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-19a.1201.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061900081#WRY05300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463, 469, 470 and 472 together.</p>  <p>  I have welcomed the principles of the Private Members' Bill on Waste Reduction and I asked the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to look at the merits of the proposals therein.  The Committee have published their report on the Bill and there are clear issues arising that need to be addressed.  Firstly, it is clear that the Bill as it currently stands cannot proceed without amendments.  The EU recently published its proposal to address the top ten single use plastic items that make up approximately 70% of beach litter (cotton bud sticks, cutlery, plates, straws, beverage stirrers, balloon sticks) and these proposals do include a possible ban on some items.  I fully welcomed the EU proposal on plastics, having written to the EU Commissioner in support of this, and I will not delay in introducing the necessary bans on the items provided for in the proposal when the EU legislation is finalised.  However, the provision provided in Section 3 of the Waste Reduction Bill goes beyond the EU proposal to include plastic beverage containers which are considered as packaging under the EU Packaging Directive.  Under this Directive, I am prohibited from banning such items.</p>  <p>  Secondly, more information is needed in relation to the introduction of a Deposit and Return scheme.  As such I cannot support a mandatory introduction of a scheme about which we do not have sufficient information to fully understand the impacts, positive or negative.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee report supports these concerns, particularly around costs of implementation, the effectiveness of this in achieving the desirable environmental outcomes and any potential impact on the existing kerbside collection system.  To address this, I have asked my officials to set up a pilot scheme which is in early planning stages.  This will allow us to assess the likely impacts and costs of Deposit and Return in an Irish context. </p>  <p>  Finally, in line with Oireachtas procedures, once a Bill is examined after second stage, the Ceann Comhairle may write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requesting a money message which informs both the Committee and the sponsors of the Bill as to the decision received.  The Ceann Comhairle has determined that this Bill could place a cost on the exchequer and as such, at this juncture the Bill can only progress in accordance with the procedures of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  I have made it absolutely clear to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, at every opportunity, that I am very happy to help progress this important Bill.  However, in addition to the proposals which are incompatible with EU law, I cannot agree to the compulsory introduction of a national Deposit and Return Scheme.  To agree to a mandatory scheme without proper analysis on the likely effect of increased costs for families and householders or evidence of its effectiveness in improving the recycling rates in this jurisdiction would be financially reckless. </p></reply>

The second study is focused on the levels of compensation provided to land and property owners in proximity to high-voltage transmission lines in a European context.​   I indicated previously that the Consultants undertaking the two studies have finalised their reports and  it is my intention that these will be brought to Government and made publicly available.

Under this scheme, &euro;25 million was targeted at commercial salmon fishermen, who were active in the fishery at the time, and funding was provided to fishermen for them to permanently cease fishing and diversify into new activity. In addition, &euro;5 million was provided for community based initiatives in areas affected by the cessation of fishing.  It closed for applications on 31st December 2007 and was ceased, with all funds expended, in 2008. There are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme.  My officials have engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine who are the National competent authority for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and with the European Commission.  I understand that any support schemes aimed at cessation of fisheries are not eligible under EMFF. </p></reply>

Fishing for eel was by way of public licence and therefore the issue of compensation does not arise. However, I directed my officials to engage with the European Commission in relation to Ireland's proposals to fund a support scheme for former eel fishermen. The outcome of that engagement confirmed that funding for the proposed measure is not eligible for support under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  However both Minister Naughten and I have secured Exchequer funding to support the measure and our position that this does not constitute State Aid has been confirmed to the Commission.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>There are circa 297 premises in the townland of Castlecomer, Co. Kilkenny.  These premises fall within a BLUE area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map available at www.broadbad.gov.ie and are within the area targeted for delivery of high speed broadband by commercial operators.  Therefore a high speed broadband service (minimum download speed 30 Mbps) for this area will be realised through commercial operators.</p><p>It is important to note that telecommunications companies operate in a liberalised market and while I have no statutory authority to intervene in their day to day operations, my Department is collating information in relation to cases/areas where commercial plans to provide access to high speed broadband to premises do not materialise. In this regard, where a premises situated in a BLUE area is unable to obtain a high speed broadband service I would encourage citizens to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie with details - quoting their address, eircode and fixed line telephone number (if available) and details of operators they have contacted with a view to obtaining a broadband service. This information will assist my Department in identifying the areas of concern and will facilitate engagement with telecommunication operators on this issue.</p><p>In addition, for those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

Newer systems such as LUAS are fully accessible.</p><p>My Department funds an ongoing programme of accessibility improvement grants to upgrade older existing infrastructure and facilities which is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA). In Budget 2018 I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the accessibility retro-fit programme to &euro;28m, as part of the 4 year capital envelope announced. </p><p>Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 the NTA has functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network, as well as having responsibility for the management of the accessibility retro-fit programme.</p><p>During my appearance last February at the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, in relation to the accessibility of public transport for people with disabilities, I undertook to ask the NTA to provide information on (i) the accessibility status of existing public transport infrastructure, (ii) the cost of making public transport services wheelchair accessible and (iii) the accessibility improvements planned with the available funding for the 4 year 2018-2021 under the retro-fit programme. My Office recently forwarded the information received from the NTA to the Clerk to the Committee. For the assistance of the Deputy, I have outlined in the table the cost figures provided by the NTA, of making public transport services wheelchair accessible.<table><tr><th>Bus   Stations</th><th>Buses/Coaches (PSO Services)</th><th>Bus Stops (PSO coach services)</th><th>Train Stations</th><th>Taxis/Hackneys</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;16.35 m</td><td>&euro;22.5 m</td><td>&euro;10 m</td><td>&euro;76 m</td><td>&euro;214 m</td><td>&euro;339 m</td></tr></table></p><p>I would emphasise that the figures provided by the NTA are estimates, due for example to complexities in relation providing accessible bus stops in rural/regional areas. In addition, the figures relate to Public Service Obligation (PSO) services only, and to Exchequer funding rather than industry costs in the case of Taxi/Hackneys. </p><p>Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the National Development Plan (NDP) over the next ten years and beyond to support the development of an integrated, accessible and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are proposed to be delivered under the NDP over the period to 2027 and these will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. In addition, there will be continued investment in the retro-fit programme under the NDP.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the pool in question received funding of &euro;3,809,214 under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme with the final (retention) payment made in March 2009.  As is the norm for grants under the Swimming Pool Programme, the original grant was conditional on the Council maintaining the facility.</p>  <p>  In terms of any possible future funding, the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) contains a commitment to establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100m available over the coming years.  It is intended that the Fund will primarily be targeted at larger new projects, including swimming pools, where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount currently available for individual projects under the Sports Capital Programme.  The draft terms and conditions of the new scheme are expected to be finalised shortly and an announcement in relation to when applications will be accepted will be made once this work is complete.  At this stage, it is envisaged that the fund will be initially focused on the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities and the possibility of accepting applications for larger scale refurbishment work is being considered.  Accordingly, it will be a matter for  Limerick City and County Council to consider any possible suitable projects for application once the new scheme opens later this year.</p></reply>

In May 2016, the company entered into an agreement with a German company Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft &amp;amp; Co.KG (FSG) to construct the WB Yeats at a contract price of &euro;144million.</p>  <p>  My Department through the IMDO works closely with all existing ferry operators and have been in contact with the Company. Irish Ferries was advised by the German company on Friday 20 April of a delay in the delivery of the new vessel by at least a month. On the 12 June 2018 Irish Ferries issued a press release advising that the delivery of the W.B. Yeats from FSG was further delayed. The Company have stated that this delay is due to extraordinary circumstances beyond its control.</p>  <p>  As a result of this Irish Ferries has now taken a commercial decision to cancel all planned sailings to France for the W.B. Yeats vessel this summer. They are proactively handling the situation and they are contacting affected customers informing them of the cancellations and offering alternative travel options, including alternative direct sailings. </p>  <p>   Up to 90% of those affected can be accommodated on the Oscar Wilde sailings from Rosslare to France or on sailings on the Epsilon from Dublin to France at weekends or can opt for a land-bridge option i.e. sailing to the UK from either Dublin or Rosslare and then to France.</p>  <p>  I understand that customers who choose the land-bridge option will be reimbursed the cost of their fuel requirements from the port of arrival in the UK to the port of arrival in France.</p>  <p>  If alternative travel options do not suit customers full refunds of any monies paid will be given. They are also offering each affected customer a &euro;150 voucher which can be used on any of their Ireland-France routes next year.</p></reply>

It will include a full redesign of the bus network in order to provide a better and more efficient network for passengers; an expanded and modern fleet of vehicles; new road infrastructure to facilitate bus priority and faster journeys for public transport users, and also upgraded facilities for cyclists and pedestrians; improved passenger information and ticketing technology; and transition to a lower emission bus fleet.</p>  <p>  Currently, on the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are only in place for less than one third of the corridor.  This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.</p>  <p>  Approximately 70% of people travelling into Dublin city each morning do so by sustainable transport.  The bus system is important because each day the majority (57% of all public transport trips) use the bus for this journey.</p>  <p>  Bus is therefore the main component of the solution to address our current congestion problem and to meet our future transport needs.  As those numbers grow, and as congestion worsens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region.</p>  <p>  Last week, the NTA published a discussion document outlining the Core Bus Corridor Project that is part of a wider BusConnects programme for Ireland&rsquo;s cities, starting in Dublin and rolling out to Galway, Cork and Ireland&rsquo;s remaining cities.</p>  <p>  The NTA&rsquo;s document focusses on the 230 km of continuous bus priority across 16 core bus routes expected achieve up to 40%-50% savings on current journey times and the 200 km plus of cycle tracks/lanes and pedestrian facilities that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of Dublin city under this new investment Programme.  These proposals are going to revolutionise traffic in the centre and outskirts of Dublin.  It takes into consideration the current congestion situation and the challenges and opportunities that Dublin will face over the coming decades while setting out some of the key impacts, issues and challenges that relate to the 16 corridors.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve this, in some areas on these corridors, roads will need to be widened, traffic lanes will have to be converted to bus lanes, on-street parking will have to be restricted and trees and parts of front gardens will have to be removed.  These are the difficult decisions that have to be made if we are to provide a fit-for-purpose bus system for Dublin city.  Dublin will become increasingly congested and a less attractive place to live and work if we decide not to make these changes now.</p>  <p>  The document also sets out mitigations to these challenges including compensation as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Following, last week&rsquo;s launch by the NTA of a discussion document focussed on 16 core bus routes, the NTA will conduct a public consultation on the redesign of Dublin's bus network, including proposals on a major redesign of routes, schedules and fare structures.  This is expected in July.</p>  <p>  Later this year, the NTA then plans to hold a public consultation on the emerging proposals for the 16 core bus corridors, expected in September/October.</p>  <p>  This is to ensure that the public are fully informed by NTA about the BusConnects programme as it progresses and have ample opportunity to input at various stages to its development.  It should be stressed that all of the routes and options are indicative only at this stage.  Individual properties will not be identified until detailed designs have been completed and that will feed into the consultation process expected in September/October.</p>  <p>  There is a clear need to expand attractive public transport alternatives to car transport to reduce congestion and emissions and enable the transport sector to cater for the demands associated with longer-term population and employment growth in a sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  This is why the major flagship investments to be delivered within Project Ireland 2040 and the 10-year National Development Plan horizon such as Bus Connects for Ireland&rsquo;s cities and projects like the Metro Link, DART Expansion, expanded Luas services and cycling and walking infrastructure are needed to ease congestion, lower carbon output and add greatly to the quality and standard of our transport system.</p>  <p>  Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred your queries to the NTA for consideration and direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Unfortunately I was unable to travel to Luxembourg to attend Council on this occasion; however, I am hoping to reschedule these meetings in the near future.</p><p>In May, I met both Professor P&eacute;ter Bal&aacute;zs, the EU Coordinator for the North-Sea Mediterranean TEN-T Corridor, and Brian Simpson, the EU Coordinator for the Motorways of the Sea programme.  Brexit was a key point on the agenda and both Coordinators are cognisant of the unique challenges facing Ireland as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union.</p><p>In October 2017 I met the EU Transport Commissioner, Ms Violeta Bulc, during her visit to Ireland and raised with her Ireland's concerns in relation to the implications of Brexit on transport and connectivity.  I previously met Commissioner Bulc at the Transport Council in Luxembourg in June 2017.</p><p>In September 2017, I held a conference call with Ken Skates AM, the Welsh Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Infrastructure, on Brexit related matters.</p><p>In June 2017, I met the Austrian Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology, J&ouml;rg Leichtfried, in relation to Brexit and Road Safety.  I also met with members of the External Affairs Committee of the National Assembly for Wales on matters primarily relating to Brexit.</p><p>In May 2017, I met the Swedish Minister for Infrastructure, Anna Johansson, on road safety and Brexit matters.</p><p>I also met the UK Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, on two occasions in 2017.</p><p>As can be seen from the above, I have engaged with relevant European colleagues on this importance issue throughout the last 12 months and will continue to do so in the coming months ahead.</p></reply>

This is a long term Strategy with the aim of increasing the number, length and regional spread of greenways across the country.  It will set out guidance to project promoters on matters including strategic nature, length, design standards, accommodation works and early consultation with communities and land owners along proposed routes.</p>  <p>  It is important that the National Strategy for the future development of Greenways would be subject to indepth consultation with relevant stakeholders.  That consultation has now been completed and my officials are currently finalising the Strategy.  I expect to publish the Strategy in the coming month.  This will be followed by call for applications later in 2018 with a view to awarding funding to a number of projects for drawdown between 2019 to 2021.  In this regard, I was pleased to secure additional funding for greenways last year bringing the total available for the period 2018 to 2021 to &euro;55.9m.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Galway to Dublin Greenway it is not possible at this stage to estimate how long it will take for it to be constructed.  The development of the Greenway west of the Shannon was paused in 2015 to allow all stakeholders to reflect on the issues raised locally and to consider how best to progress this project, especially in terms of route selection and landowner consultations.</p>  <p>  With this in mind I recently requested TII and the Steering Group managing this project to look again at the route options report to see if a route can be identified that works locally and has the support of key landowners.  While the work of TII and the Steering Group is ongoing I am not in a position to comment on either the timeframe or budget required to construct the greenway between Athlone and Galway.</p>  <p>  Since 2015 progress has been made on other greenway projects, namely the sections of the Galway to Dublin Greenway in Kildare and Meath, and the opening of the Waterford Greenway.  The high standard of accommodation works provided to adjacent landowners on the Waterford Greenway have demonstrated how measures can be put in place to significantly mitigate potential impacts on operational farm holders.  The Waterford Greenway has also had a very significant economic impact on towns such as Kilmacthomas.  I believe the same impact can be replicated in Roscommon and Galway and development of the Dublin-Greenway remains an objective for the Government.</p></reply>

The 27 projects to be funded will provide supports and assistance to more than 2,600 young people with disabilities aged between 15 to 29 years old. The programme will promote employment prospects and meaningful social roles for young people with disabilities and in particular, young people who are distant from the labour market, using a range of person-centred supports.</p><p>The initiative is being co-funded by the Exchequer and the EU (under the European Social Fund, as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020) which demonstrates the commitment, at both a Governmental and EU level, to supporting and assisting young people with disabilities to achieve their individual employment and other goals. </p><p>Pobal have been contracted by DEASP to manage the programme including the application and evaluation process. Details of the application process are available on Pobal&rsquo;s website (under &ldquo;Useful Links&rdquo;) at </p><p>As part of the application process, Pobal undertook an extensive information campaign (including information events held in Cavan, Dublin and Limerick) and a facility to address questions that potential applicants might have about the process.</p><p>Pobal received 59 applications which were assessed in detail and made recommendations for funding for 27 applications to the total value of &euro;15,615,690 over three years.  At the time of the launch of the measure, it was expected that funding for the programme would amount to some &euro;10 million over a three year period. However, given the number and quality of the proposals received, enhanced funding arrangements have been put in place of &euro;16 million to support all 27 projects recommended for funding by Pobal.When account is taken of costs associated with administration and evaluation of the programme, total programme cost over its entire lifetime is expected to be in excess of &euro;16 million.</p><p>Summary of statistics related to number of applications, number of successful applications and financial allocation by county are shown in Table 1.</p><p><b>Table 1: Ability programme &ndash; applications, recommendations and funding by county</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Applications received</th><th>Applications recommended for funding</th><th>Recommended funding by county</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;1,929,042</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Down</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>24</td><td>13</td><td>&euro;8,007,900</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;724,583</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;531,176</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;264,421</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;514,776</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;570,853</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;633,919</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;1,240,655</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;1,198,365</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>59</td><td>27</td><td>&euro;15,615,690</td></tr></table></p><p>Recommendations as to which applications should receive funding were based on a detailed and independent assessment process undertaken by Pobal.  Pobal awarded scores (out of 100) for all applications, with scores being assigned to each proposal based on a weighted marking system linked with the schemes evaluation criteria as follows:</p><p>- Meeting the programme/ measure priorities (40%)</p><p>- Need for the proposal (20%)</p><p>- Capacity of the organisation (20%)</p><p>- Value for money (20%)</p><p>The assessment process was based on the materials provided by the applicant as to how they proposed to address the objectives of the scheme in line with the award criteria, as set out above.  This process was based entirely on the quality of the application and this applied irrespective of where the application originated.  Only projects receiving a score of 60 or above were deemed by Pobal to be of sufficiently high standard to be recommended for funding.  </p><p>On this basis, Pobal recommended 27 projects as being suitable for funding; this represents some 46% of the proposals received.  These recommendations were accepted as they were made by Pobal on the basis of the above objective criteria only, which were communicated to all applicants equally as part of the information campaign and programme materials. </p><p>One application was received from Co. Donegal.  It was not recommended for funding as it received a score of less than 60.  </p><p>Decisions as to funding were based entirely on the assessment and on the recommendation coming from the Pobal assessment process.  Neither I, Minister Doherty nor the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection had any role to play in deciding on individual recommendations under this completely independent assessment process.  Therefore the question of the application being supported by the Minister or otherwise did not arise.</p><p>It is important to note that Pobal has put in place an appeals procedure for applicants who feel that decisions taken and procedures followed by Pobal in relation to its administration of funding applications was not applied fairly or consistently. Details of the procedure are on Pobal&rsquo;s website (under &ldquo;Useful Links&rdquo;) at: </p><p>It is also important to note that while some of the successful applications came from organisations that are headquartered or based in particular locations, some of the projects will be providing services beyond that county in which they are based, and in some cases providing services across the country.</p><p>It is also important to acknowledge that even though support has not been allocated to specific counties under the Ability programme, the DEASP and other agencies provide a range of supports throughout the country.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection continues through its nationwide network of Intreo offices and through the EmployAbility service (a specialist service that has been designed to support people with disabilities &ndash; which is delivered on behalf of the department by 23 companies located around the country) to offer a full range of supports and services to people with disabilities who wish to pursue their employment ambitions. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s will be extended beyond twelve months and it is not in the interest of any participant that such work placements extend for prolonged periods of time.

The duration of a person's jobseekers claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment, any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks are considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment &ndash; this is known as linking the claims.  Long-term jobseekers that have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that 52 week period.  The linking of claims allows the client to retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits), it also ensures they are also available for selection for activation services including JobPath as it is a priority of my Department to ensure that all Jobseekers receive support in returning to the workforce in a most timely and efficient manner as possible</p>  <p>  In the case mentioned, the person concerned engaged with the JobPath service up to August 2017 and shortly afterwards was successful in finding a temporary position for 5 months before returning to the live register where they were again eligible for selection for receipt of activation support and the person was randomly selected for referral to the JobPath service in March 2018.</p>  <p>  For this person in common with other jobseekers who are referred to the JobPath service after short periods of employment, the one to one case managed service will provide the support and assistance necessary to build on skills gained in the employment; to reconsider employment preferences if necessary and ensure that the work experience and other relevant information is factored into all future job applications. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;237 million this year on HHB for over 437,000 customers.  </p>  <p>  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Therefore anyone aged less than 70 years of age must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department or satisfy a means test in order to qualify for HHB.  </p>  <p>  People in receipt of HHB aged under 66 are generally in receipt of payments such as Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance or Carers.  These payment types mean that the recipients are unable to work full time and earn additional income.  This is not the case for people in receipt of widow&rsquo;s contributory payment who are aged less than 66.  These recipients, who are of working age and generally are capable of work, may take up full-time employment, at any level of remuneration, without losing entitlement to their widow&rsquo;s contributory payment.  </p>  <p>  In general, widow&rsquo;s pension only becomes a qualifying payment for HHB once the recipient reaches the age of 66 (State pension age) to ensure alignment with secondary benefits that are available to people in receipt of the State pension. </p>  <p>  The concession whereby widows aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse/civil partner received HHB from my Department, may qualify for the package was introduced at a time when State pension age was 65 and this cohort of widows were seen as significantly less likely to be in a position to take up employment than those of a younger age.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the concession to widows aged less than 60 or to allow recipients of widow&rsquo;s pension of any age to qualify for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  It would also be necessary to consider whether they would be a priority group for the extension of such benefits ahead of other groups such as the unemployed or lone parents.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Report Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il is scheduled for 26 and 27 June. </p><p>The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is an important piece of legislation. It contains a range of measures designed to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. It aims to do this by:</p><p>- Providing that employees are better informed about their terms of employment, particularly their core terms at an early stage - this includes much greater clarity about the hours they will be expected to work in a normal working day and a normal working week.</p><p>- Improved compensation for low-paid employees called in to work but sent home without the expected work.</p><p>- Introducing a Banded Hours provision for employees whose contracts of employment do not reflect the reality of the hours they have worked consistently over a 12 month reference period.</p><p>- Stronger anti-penalisation provisions for employees where they seek to exercise their rights under the Bill. </p><p>I will continue to work with colleagues on all sides of the House to progress this Bill as expeditiously as possible so that we deliver legislation that is fair, balanced and that works in practice.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>The average processing times for all appeals determined by Appeals Officers from 2013 to 2017 and to the end of May 2018 broken down by all social welfare scheme types are set out in the tables.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that these times are averages only.  Some straightforward appeals may take much less time than the average to be determined, while others can take considerably longer depending, for example, on the type and complexity of the case and whether an oral hearing is required. </p><p>In cases where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person without the need for the case to be referred to an Appeals Officer. </p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;<i>de-novo</i>&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p><p>Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures to the end of May 2018 are 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.6 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>A number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office. </p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. </p><p><b>2013 - Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01/2013 &ndash;

This is to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p>  <p>  All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects all aspects of the appeal process including time spent in the Department preparing the appeal submission.  The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages which is to the benefit of the appellant. </p>  <p>  Appeal processing times are kept under constant scrutiny by the Chief Appeals Officer.  The Deputy will be aware that significant effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to reducing the length of the time taken to finalise an appeal.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for May 2018 are 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.6 weeks for a summary decision.</p>  <p>  A number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department may make an urgent needs payment (UNP) to a person who may not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time.  The Government has provided over &euro;36.4 million for ENPs and UNPs in 2018. </p><p>There are a number of categories specifically excluded in legislation from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme, including ENPs.  These include people in full-time work and people in full-time education.  These exclusions do not apply under the UNP scheme. </p><p>The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The principle consideration in making a payment under the ENP scheme is to address a particular once-off and exceptional need.</p><p>The guidelines issued to staff administering the ENP scheme assist them in the decision making process.  The guidelines do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise, so that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>Statistics are maintained relating to payments under the ENP and UNP schemes, however they are not maintained on the number of applications or the outcome of those applications.  Details of the number of payments made under the ENP scheme for the years 2013 to 2017 and to end of May 2018 are set out in the following tabular statement.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   </p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the Exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, and in particular the long-term unemployed. </p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in reducing long-term unemployment.  For example, the most recent data shows that the rate of long-term unemployment in Ireland has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 2.5%. in Q4 2017.  This downward trend indicates that Ireland is well on course to bring long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with <i>Pathways to Work</i>targets for 2020, and maybe even improve on it.</p><p>Policy continues to focus on support for the long-term unemployed.  For example, the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people &ndash; most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; through targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  </p><p>The table shows the most recent end of month statistics on the number of people availing of a range of programmes targeted primarily at the long-term unemployed (over 12 months).

Up to 20 years of HomeCaring credits, and/or 10 years of other qualifying credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.</p><p>Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements with effect from 30<sup>th</sup>March 2018.  Following this, IT solutions must be developed in line with that legislation.</p><p>Pensioners do not need to contact the Department about this.  Instead, the Department will invite over 50,000 pensioners, who were assessed under the current rate bands in place since 2012, to have their pensions recalculated under this interim TCA solution to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  The Department expects to send out these invitations from Quarter 4 of 2018 and to begin payments, including arrears for any period from 30 March 2018, from Quarter 1 of 2019.</p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-19a.1513.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061900087#WREE05100"><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p><p>The schemes with the highest number of appeals to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2017 and 2018 (to the end of May) were - disability allowance (5,077 in 2017 and 1,883 in 2018), carer&rsquo;s allowance (3,200 in 2017 and 1,137 in 2018), jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance - payments (1,676 in 2017 and 637 in 2018), jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance - means (1,504 in 2017 and 607 in 2018), supplementary welfare allowance (1,302 in 2017 and 390 in 2018), invalidity pension (1,381 in 2017 and 576 in 2018) and domiciliary care allowance (1,199 in 2017 and 577 in 2018).  </p><p>The tables set out the following in respect of 2017 and 2018 (to the end of May); (1) all appeal receipts, (2) the appeal outcomes in respect of the schemes with the highest number of appeals and (3) the outcomes of appeals determined by way of oral hearing. </p><p>Overall, 60.1% of the 18,980 appeals which were finalised in 2017 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer/Designated Person.  57.5% of the 7,562 appeals finalised to date in 2018 had a favourable outcome for the appellant. </p><p>Of the 13,556 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2017, 5,412 (39.9%) were determined following an oral hearing.  3,444 (63.6%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 5,620 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers to date in 2018, 2,100 (37.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  1,289 (61.4%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. </p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person as was the case in some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2017 and some 35% in 2018.  Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at the oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Decisions concerning entitlement to a social welfare payment or insurability of employment often require a high level of judgment and may involve complex legal questions.  The Courts have found that decision makers are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.</p><p>Where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Receipts 2017 &ndash; 2018</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2017</th><th>2018<br /><br />(to 31 May 2018)</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive

The on-line calculator on this website has also been amended in order to take the cost of mortgage protection insurance into account.  This will therefore give potential applicants a clearer indication of the amount that they could be eligible to borrow under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to clarify issues that arise around the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, as necessary, as is the case with any other scheme.  I have not asked for a formal review of the scheme at this stage, nor do I believe that one is necessary, given the positive response to it to date. This is evident from the almost 1,500 loan applications submitted by local authorities to the Housing Agency, for assessment, as of the end of May.  </p></reply>

The intention was that this investment would be off-balance sheet and in Budget 2015, the Government announced that &euro;400m of public investment would be made available, including the proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is, to provide 2,000 homes.  The objective was that this investment could leverage private sector finance from the EIB, ISIF, pension funds, credit unions and other financial institutions.  </p>  <p>  A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.  A body called the Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group was established in 2015 to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved.  However, despite a detailed investigation of options to use the available funding in this way, including a high level of engagement with potential social housing providers and potential financiers of social housing, no new model that would, of itself, be capable of providing and/or financing social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified that would be capable of utilising the available funding.  </p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided to modify the original commitment in relation to the &euro;400m funding to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a longer period (20 years), which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme, as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland.  Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated to my Department's Vote in 2017.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore and taking account of the work and analysis of the Clearing House Group, it was considered that it would be more constructive to use the existing social housing funding and support mechanisms and, where appropriate, make adjustments to those mechanisms, in order to provide a framework with more realistic prospects of harnessing private investment in an off-balance sheet manner.  </p>  <p>  This approach resulted in the design of an alternative delivery mechanism, the Enhanced Long-term Leasing Social Housing Scheme, which was launched on 31 January 2018.  Funding is in place to support the delivery of this new scheme and the principal objective of the scheme is to encourage larger levels of private investment in social housing, while ensuring that the resulting leasing arrangement is off-balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure.  The scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available for leasing existing properties.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the commitment to develop an affordable rental model, this is now being progressed through an initial pilot project in Dublin, based on a cost rental model, where local authorities can release the value of their land, and also access funding for enabling infrastructure, to reduce the construction costs of providing such rental units and facilitate the delivery of the optimal number of affordable homes to rent for low- to moderate-income households, as part of mixed-tenure developments.  Lands held by local authorities, particularly in urban areas where there are high rental costs and significant housing demand, are being identified for cost rental projects, including a large-scale cost rental site in Dublin city, details of which I expect to announce shortly.  </p></reply>

This included an analysis of the financial impact of the EUROSTAT decision to reclassify the majority of Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) as part of the local government sector.  This was an important first step in the Government's assessment as to the impact of the EUROSTAT decision.  The Department of Finance is now undertaking an analysis of the implications for General Government Expenditure and General Government Debt up to 2021.  My Department continues to engage with the Department of Finance in relation to this work.  </p>  <p>  Following the completion of the initial analysis, which has defined the scope of the financial implications of this decision for the Exchequer, my Department also held discussions with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that AHBs can continue to fulfil their full potential in the delivery of the targets set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the AHB sector and has had constructive discussions with it on the issue.  I understand that the sector itself has engaged its own research on the matter and my Department is evaluating that research, as part of its ongoing consideration on the issue.  I understand that the AHB representative bodies have indicated that they intend to submit further proposals to my Department concerning possible suggested ways forward, and these will be evaluated as soon as they are submitted.  I remain fully committed to continuing to work with the AHB sector to assess the options available to create the necessary conditions to allow this classification decision to be revisited in the future.  </p>  <p>  As previously noted, the Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain the momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the Action Plan.  </p></reply>

To date its efforts have been focussed on Pillars 3 and 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, &ldquo;Build more homes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Utilise existing housing stock&rdquo;.  A key consideration for the group is the provision of timely and detailed data to assess the numbers of new homes becoming available to meet housing demand.  </p>  <p>  In parallel to the work of the group, my Department initiated a process of discussions with the ESB and the Central Statistics Office to identify if the CSO could provide a more detailed disaggregation of the ESB data set.  The Central Statistics Office has particular powers arising from the Statistics Acts and also has a wide breadth of other data sets at its disposal, including but not limited to the results of Census.  The CSO can combine data from these various sources to create a new and much more detailed dataset for analysis and reporting.  </p>  <p>  Arising from this process the Central Statistics Office published a new measure of New Dwelling Completions on June 14th and I welcome the additional clarity that this has brought to this issue and the evidence it provides that Rebuilding Ireland is working to significantly increase the numbers of new homes available for use since its introduction.  </p>  <p>  The Housing Data Analytics Group will be considering the new CSO report at its next meeting and will continue its consideration of other initiatives in respect of housing statistics more generally.  </p></reply>

The scheme applies to adaptations that are necessary to address the needs of older people or people with a disability who may require stair-lifts; grab-rails; showers; wet-rooms and ramps etc.  It also provides funding for extensions such as the installation of a downstairs bedroom or bathroom. </p>  <p>  The scheme is demand-led and allows local authorities to prioritise works based on need.  Exchequer funding meets 90% of the cost of such works, with the local authority providing the remaining 10%.</p>  <p>  The scheme also provides funding for Improvement Works in Lieu of Social Housing (IWIL&rsquo;s) in order to improve or extend privately owned accommodation where the applicant is already approved for social housing.  This allows people to remain in private housing while their housing need is met without increasing the strain on current social housing stock and also reduces the numbers of persons who might otherwise find themselves homeless. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that there were no delays for priority and urgent cases, all local authorities were advised that they may undertake works of up to 65% of their 2017 allocation in advance of the notification of their 2018 allocation.  This allowed them to plan and progress works under the scheme and allows for the full utilisation of the 2018 allocation throughout the year.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have submitted to my Department details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this scheme in 2018.  These proposals have now been evaluated and funding allocations will be confirmed to the local authorities shortly. </p></reply>

CIRI was established on a voluntary basis in 2014 and over 800 building and contracting entities are currently included on the register. </p>  <p>  At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the CIRI on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.

The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  In addition, it will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.</p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP.  Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector.  My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications or payments.  The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC.  On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  More than 37,000 households are currently in receipt of HAP support.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. </p></reply>

However, the NTICI was not intended as an ongoing funding support to the taking-in-charge process but rather an exercise in developing new approaches to analysing the level of estates not yet taken in charge and the steps to be taken in expediting applications on hand.</p>  <p>  The findings and recommendations from the NTICI process will be included in a report on the initiative that I intend to publish shortly.  The publication of the NTICI report will be of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) also includes provision of &euro;31 million for resolving developer-provided infrastructure for the period 2018-2021.  This is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to transitioning from a pilot phase under NTICI to a programme phase, commencing with an Estimates provision of &euro;3m in 2018 and on which I intend to announce further details in the coming months.</p>  <p>  It is therefore a matter for Kerry County Council, as the authority that granted planning permission for the development in question, to consider what steps it intends to take in relation to the taking-in-charge or otherwise of the development in conjunction with the residents, in the light of its experience with the NTICI and its identification of appropriate funding to resolve any issues in relation to the development.

Under the cost rental approach, rents are set at levels to recover construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, with only a minimal amount of retained earnings included.</p>  <p>  The pilot project is currently being progressed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, at Enniskerry Road, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB), using land owned by the Housing Agency.  Delivering 50 cost rental units as part of a 150-home development, this pilot is providing very valuable learning to inform the wider roll-out of the cost rental model.</p>  <p>  The development of local authority sites for cost rental homes must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework and procurement rules, the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money, and financial accountability.</p>  <p>  Planning permission for the Enniskerry Road project is in place, and I expect that the development will go out to tender in the coming weeks, with a site start later this year.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, local authorities have statutory powers in relation to their roads and planning functions which enable the taking in charge of housing estates, once completed, and a valid application for taking in charge has been received from the developer or residents.  They also have extensive enforcement powers to ensure that the conditions attaching to planning permissions are complied with.</p><p>The taking-in-charge of residential estates is therefore a matter for the relevant local authority and is provided for under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) and procedures for this are initiated under section 11 of the Roads Act 1993.  A planning authority, where requested by the developer and/or by the majority of the owners of the houses involved, may take a development in charge, including the provision of roads, open spaces, car parks, and sewers.</p><p>My Department, by way of circular letter PD 1/2008, dated 26 February 2008, issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities on Taking in Charge of Residential Developments/ Management Arrangements.  A copy of the circular is available on my Department's website at the following link:  <i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Planning/FileDownLoad%2C16779%2Cen.pdf. </i></p><p>This circular advised each planning authority to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking-in-charge, based on the following principles (among others):</p><p>-  Certain core facilities/infrastructure to be taken in charge on request - public roads and footpaths, unallocated surface parking areas, public lighting, public water supply, foul and storm water drainage and public open spaces; and</p><p>-  The procedures for taking-in-charge to begin promptly, on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate.  Protocols, including time frames, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking-in-charge.</p><p>Local authorities also perform many important road safety functions, and if residents have concerns in relation to the safety of roads and public thoroughfares in a particular housing development, these should be referred to the designated road safety officer within the relevant local authority for consideration in the context of the enforcement and taking-in-charge functions of that authority.</p></reply>

It is intended that this action plan will be published shortly. </p><p>In terms of directly ensuring that spoken Irish is recorded and preserved for the benefit of future generations, the Department has funded a number of projects in recent years which are relevant to this area, namely:</p><p><b>Logainm.ie - Sound Archive of the Placenames Branch</b></p><p>Logainm.ie is a comprehensive management system for data, archival records and placenames research conducted by the State.  It is a public resource for Irish people at home and abroad, and for all those who appreciate the rich heritage of Irish placenames.  The sound archive consists of the placenames recordings of my Department's Placenames Branch. It contains more than 1,200 hours of recordings made mainly in the 1960s and 1970s.  The recordings were made in 24 counties and placenames were collected from more than 4,000 people during that period.</p><p>The audio material and its catalogue were digitised in 2009.  As a result of that work, the audio and catalogue material are now available online for the staff of the Placenames Branch and for other researchers.  In addition, the Logainm website has associated sound files which allow users to listen to the pronunciation of each placename in Irish and English.</p><p><b>D&uacute;chas.ie </b></p><p>The D&uacute;chas project, co-funded by my Department, with support from the National Lottery and University College Dublin, is the result of a partnership, beginning in 2012, between the National Folklore Collection in UCD, one of the largest folklore collections in the world, UCD Digital Library and Fiontar &amp;amp; Scoil na Gaeilge, the Irish-medium teaching and research unit in DCU.  The objective of the project is to digitize the National Folklore Collection and make it available to the public online.  To date, almost 500,000 manuscript pages of folklore compiled by schoolchildren in the 1930s have been digitized and published on the duchas.ie website. </p><p>Last year, over 11,000 digitised photographs from the The Photographic Collection, were added to the site.  The aim of the current phase of the project is to continue the development, digitisation and editorial work, focusing on the Main Manuscript Collection.  The collection also has over 12,000 hours of audio recordings and 1,000 hours of video recordings in its archives, many of them in the Irish language.  Most of the sound recordings are on tape but other formats are also included and it is envisaged that many of these will be digitised to ensure their ongoing preservation.</p></reply>
