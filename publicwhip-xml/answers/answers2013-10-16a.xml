It delivers on the commitment in the Programme for Government to review the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid and sets out the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in international development over the coming years.  I believe this new framework which will help bring greater coherence to our work, and enable us to better plan for and measure more comprehensively the results which our development efforts are achieving.    The fight against global poverty and hunger remain at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme and our policies on international development.  However, we are also placing a strong emphasis on responding to situations of fragility and conflict, on inclusive and equitable economic growth, and on the promotion and protection of human rights. Importantly, the new policy also promotes more rounded relationships with our Key Partner Countries stressing the need to bring economic and political relations further into our dialogue and work with them.</p><p>  In this context, One World, One Future makes a commitment to ensuring that economic development, including engagement by Irish companies, is compatible with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to human rights. It states that we will be guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council on 16 June 2011. These principles highlight the duty of states to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, the corporate responsibility to respect human rights and the need for victims to have access an appropriate remedy when violations take place.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which manages the Government&rsquo;s development programme, is now preparing an implementation plan which will set out the steps to be taken to give effect to the commitments made in One World, One Future, including those on business and human rights.  These steps will also inform the broader considerations by Government Departments on how best to develop a National Action Plan on the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  </p></reply>

NAMA&rsquo;s role is that of a secured lender, like any bank they own the debt while the debtor or appointed liquidator still owns and controls the assets and is ultimately responsible for these assets, the Agency is therefore not in a position to compel its debtors and receivers to cede property either free of charge or at less than market value.</p><p>  Decisions relating to the disposal of properties securing NAMA loans are an operational matter for the Board of NAMA which is guided by its commercial mandate under the NAMA Act 2009.  Section 10 of the NAMA Act statutorily obliges NAMA to &lsquo;obtain the best achievable return for the State&rsquo; from the management or its acquired loan portfolio.  NAMA is obliged to carry out its functions in the context of the overriding commercial objective provided for by Section 10 of the Act and to recover the greatest amount possible for the taxpayer from the sale of loans and properties securing its loans.</p><p>  NAMA fulfils its social obligation remit by facilitating a dialogue between NAMA debtors and 3rd parties so as to enable the latter to acquire suitable property for social, sporting and other public purposes.  Importantly, the NAMA Board has committed to giving first refusal to any public authority, including Government departments, State agencies and local authorities, in respect of the purchase of property from NAMA debtors and receivers which may be suitable for their purposes.  In line with this commitment, NAMA has accommodated the release of lands and property for schools, health care facilities, community and recreational amenities and other uses. Examples include:</p><p>- The identification of 4,350 houses and apartments for social housing</p><p>- The identification of more than 70 sites as potentially suitable for new schools</p><p>- The sale of sites to University College Dublin and University College Cork</p><p>- The sale of the Opera Centre site in Limerick to Limerick City Council</p><p>- The release of lands in Baldoyle, north Co. Dublin to Fingal County Council for parkland</p><p>- Co-funding, with Fingal County Council, of an N2-N3 link road through lands in west Dublin to facilitate identified development requirements</p><p>  NAMA is also engaging with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive in relation to possible sites and buildings for primary health care centres and other step-down and community health care facilities.</p><p>  The Agency, therefore, whilst working to obtain the best achievable financial return for the taxpayer, is very open to realistic proposals that achieve desirable social objectives and there are numerous examples of this.  In addition to NAMA&rsquo;s on-going engagement with public bodies in relation to specific initiatives, such as social housing, it is open to any public body to identify its interest in lands and property securing the Agency&rsquo;s loans.</p><p>  I believe the approach determined by NAMA&rsquo;s Board is contributing in terms of its primary commercial objective, while at the same time contributing to the achievement of wider public policy objectives.  In light of this I do not intend to intervene, through legislative amendment or otherwise, in NAMA&rsquo;s positive work in this area.</p></reply>

The EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC) generally provides that supplies of goods and services be chargeable to VAT at the standard rate but that lower rates are permitted in very limited circumstances.  Food products can only benefit from the zero rating in accordance with Article 110 of the VAT Directive which permits the retention of the zero rate for &ldquo;clearly defined social reasons&rdquo; where the products were liable to VAT at the zero rate on 1 January 1991.  This does not apply in the case of smoothies, and accordingly they are liable to VAT at the standard rate. </p></reply>

The decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.   I understand that insurance companies as a matter of course carry out reviews of the risks that they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make a decision to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk such as homes close to a river which has previously flooded. These types of decisions are made sometimes on the basis of their broad past experience rather than looking at the individual circumstances of householders. </p><p>  The idea of making flood insurance compulsory has been considered. However, since it would never be possible to prevent insurance companies quoting based on the underlying risk, it would mean that in areas where there was likely to be regular flooding, the cost of insurance would almost certainly be prohibitive and could make premiums unaffordable for policyholders in general.</p><p>  What the Government can do, however, is try to address the underlying flooding problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works is committed to doing all it can to alleviate the impact of flooding through the provision of defences and by taking steps to manage and reduce flood risk in the future through a strategic and sustainable approach under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which, along with expenditure on maintenance of arterial drainage schemes, will see up to &euro;250 million being spent on floor relief measures over a five year period. </p><p>  The OPW aims at all times to ensure that any major flood relief works it carries out, either directly or which it funds local authorities to carry out on its behalf, are executed to a very high standard and, insofar as possible, offer protection against a 1 in 100 year flood event.  The OPW has carried out extensive flood relief works in urban areas throughout the country since 1995 and it is satisfied that those works have been effective in protecting a significant number of properties from flood damage. The OPW inform me that works on the Clonmel flood relief schemes 2 main phases (West and North/East) are now completed and the properties previously at risk of flooding are now protected to a 1 in 100 year standard. </p><p>  I am also informed that the OPW and the Irish Insurance Federation have been engaged in discussions to agree a system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW or, in certain instances, by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.</p><p>  These discussions are aimed at putting in place a process which will provide the necessary reassurance to insurance companies that remedial works have been carried out to a sufficiently high level to enable them re-commence the provision of flood cover in areas which previously have been vulnerable to flooding. </p><p>  Agreement on the format of that information has been reached and the OPW has supplied an initial batch of information to Insurance Ireland, including the design standard and extent of benefitting properties and lands in a number of locations where capital flood protection works have been completed by OPW in recent years.  The State has made a very significant investment in ensuring that households and businesses in Clonmel are protected from flooding and detailed information on the completed scheme/works has been provided in the agreed format to Insurance Ireland for dissemination to its member companies. </p><p>The OPW met with Insurance Ireland recently to review the arrangements and timelines for Insurance Ireland's constituent member companies to incorporate that information into their IT platforms and risk assessment systems. This work will take time but it is hoped that the insurance companies will be in a position to have their systems updated and operational before year end  .</p></reply>

Depending on the Credit Union's own risk assessment of the customer, additional ID verification may be required. The relevant statutory provision is set out in section 33(2)(a) of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Acts 2010 - 2013.   While it is up to each institution to decide on a risk based approach whether they will accept other forms of customer ID, the documentation set out above should be considered the standard expected to be applied in most cases to meet the obligation in section 33 of the Acts to confirm the identity of the customer. </p><p>However, guidelines which were devised by the Irish League of Credit Unions in January 2013 provide assistance to credit unions with younger prospective customers.

However, that which can be measured is the tax, together with associated interest and penalties, recovered by the Revenue Commissioners from the compliance interventions carried out by their officials.  I must emphasise, however, Revenue&rsquo;s compliance interventions target all forms of tax non-compliance, which can include innocent error, technical misinterpretations as well as fraudulent behaviours like deliberate overstatement of expenses and suppression of income.   The yield, incorporating tax, interest and penalties, derived from Revenue&rsquo;s compliance interventions since 2007 may be summarised as follows &ndash;</p><p><b>Table 1:  Audit &amp;amp; Compliance Interventions 2007 &ndash; 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Compliance Interventions</th><th>Compliance Yield</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>251,934 (Audits 14,308)</td><td>&euro;733.82m (&euro;687.6m)</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>360,859 (Audits 13,414)</td><td>&euro;632.3m (&euro;569.2m)</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>373,899 (Audits 12,419)</td><td>&euro;668.0m (&euro;602.m)</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>465,804 (Audits 11,088)</td><td>&euro;492.7m (&euro;434.7m)</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>557,568 (Audits 11,066)</td><td>&euro;521.8m (&euro;440.5m)</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>537,821 (Audits  9,066)</td><td>&euro;492.4m (&euro;359.1m)</td></tr></table></p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue compliance interventions in 2012 gave rise to a total yield of &euro;492.4m of which &euro;359.1m derived from Revenue audits and &euro;133.3m from cases that did not require a Revenue audit.

This measure followed on from measures in the previous year&rsquo;s Budget which also supported farm expansion and the transfer of land.    Section 48 of Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from capital gains tax on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring, subject to a Commencement Order, which I made on 6 June 2013.  The terms of the relief are set out in Section 604B, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.     </p><p>  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes. The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase. </p><p>  Full relief from capital gains tax will be given where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is equal to or exceeds the consideration for the sale or the other land that is exchanged. Where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is less than the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged, relief will be given in the same proportion that the consideration for the land that is purchased or exchanged bears to the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged. </p><p>  Provision is made for the clawback of the relief where qualifying land in respect of which relief has been given is disposed of within 5 years of the date of the purchase or exchange of that land. A clawback does not apply where the disposal arises under a compulsory purchase order. </p><p>  A prerequisite to any disposal and acquisition of farm land qualifying for this relief is that an application for a farm restructuring certificate is made to Teagasc and that Teagasc grants such a  certificate (that has not been withdrawn).  Guidelines relating to the application for, and the issue of, a Farm Restructuring Certificate are available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s website. </p><p>  Based on the limited facts presented, it is not possible to say definitively whether all conditions governing the relief are satisfied &ndash; in particular:</p><p>-   Whether the lands are qualifying lands</p><p>-   Whether or not the sales are as a result of a compulsory purchase order</p><p>-   Whether the full proceeds of the sales are invested in the purchase of the new land</p><p>-   Whether the person in question is an individual who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming.	</p></reply>

In general, the FEMPI Act continues to apply to teachers employed in Voluntary Secondary schools. In dual-union schools (Designated Community Colleges and Community and Comprehensive Schools), the FEMPI Act continues to apply to teachers who are not members of TUI. </p><p>  While certain issues of dual representation require further consideration, the position set out above provides an initial basis for the implementation of the Haddington Road Agreement. It is stressed however, that the application of the Agreement is entirely conditional upon adherence to its terms by the teachers to whom it is applied.</p><p>As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Haddington Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers). It is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.</p></reply>

There were a plethora of long-standing clustering arrangements in place which were not the most practical, efficient or cost effective way to allocate resources. In September 2012 new arrangements were introduced designed to address the limitations of the previous arrangements.Under the reforms to the teacher allocation process, schools were empowered to cluster and arrange their General Allocation Model resources in a manner that best suits their local needs, including in a manner that reduces travel between schools. This school led process has resulted in over 97% of the overall GAM/EAL allocation being in full-time stand-alone or shared posts.</p><p>  The new arrangements relating to resource hours for individual pupils involved the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools and again are designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level. 85% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours in the 2012/13 school year were allocated to schools that had resource base posts.</p><p>  The staffing arrangements for the current school year 2013/14 are outlined in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the Department website. Schools that have complied with the arrangements outlined in the circular will be given some discretion to operate, where possible, their own temporary local arrangements in relation to the day to day work arrangements of teachers in full-time shared posts. These arrangements are aimed at minimising any time lost in travelling between schools.</p></reply>

This is not a European average.  While Ireland has 17.9% at this level, this proportion is not considered to be statistically different from the survey average and is in line with nine other countries including Germany, England and Poland. I am also pleased to see that Ireland is one of only five countries that improved its performance at level one or below.</p><p>It is important to note that a person scoring at or below level one on the PIAAC survey should not be characterised as being illiterate. In fact, the reading component tests administered as part of PIAAC show that even at the lowest levels of literacy proficiency there are significant levels of reading skill. For example, persons scoring at level one show knowledge and skill in recognising basic vocabulary, evaluating the meaning of sentences and reading paragraph text.</p><p>This Government is committed to assisting people improve their life chances through improving their literacy. The results of the PIAAC survey has reinforced my view that we need to work hard on core skills. A major review of the adult literacy service has just been published and work has begun on implementing its recommendations.  In addition, SOLAS will be producing a strategy on literacy and numeracy provision as part of its development of an overall Further Education and Training Strategy.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. There are 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts available for allocation in the 2013/14 school year which is the same number of posts which were available for allocation for the 2012/13 school year. The NCSE has notified schools of their SNA allocation for 2013/14, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</p><p>  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs. The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.</p><p>  To date the NCSE has allocated 10,490 WTE SNA posts to schools. Every child who meets the criteria for access to SNA support in the current school year is in receipt of this support. The remaining 85 posts are available for allocation throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme. Based on discussions with the NCSE, it may be the case that additional SNA posts above the figure of 10,575, may be required to respond to need for the current school year. This issue will be dealt with if and when it arises. The NCSE is still processing SNA applications for the current school year.</p><p>  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the SNA allocations were made, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the current school year.

The continuum of assessment allows for the identification of pupils with special educational needs, their nature and severity by harnessing the experience of class teachers and support teachers, in consultation with parents, and with the support of the psychologist. It also provides for the development of immediate responses and interventions designed to ameliorate the particular needs identified at the appropriate level, either in the classroom or with the assistance of the support teacher. This allows for a response to be put in place at the earliest possible juncture for students before their difficulties can become intractable. Assessment of needs at this stage of the continuum involves information gathering, testing and observation by the various school personnel involved and support from the NEPS psychologist, as required.</p><p>  Where the pupil does not make adequate progress following the interventions, or  where the nature of the child's special educational needs are significant, </p><p>severe and complex, the school may agree with the psychologist that a psycho-educational assessment be conducted to identify the specific nature of the needs and the appropriate response necessary. Students, so identified, are scheduled for assessment within that school year.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that the number of psychologists employed by my  Department's NEPS service has increased annually in the lifetime of this Government from 154 (148 w.t.e.) to its current level of 177 (168 w.t.e) and that I am satisfied at the level of service it is providing to school communities nationwide. It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above. I would advise that the school Principal, in the first instance, should be contacted in relation to concerns for any pupil which requires intervention from the NEPS service.</p></reply>

It will provide the enforcement element of the so-called &lsquo;Patents Package&rsquo; which includes the Unitary Patent, ensuring that this single patent for the twenty-five participating Member States can be enforced or challenged in a single court action, rather than in multiple actions in national courts.</p><p>  The structure of the Unified Patent Court includes a Central Division that will be centred in Paris with branches in Munich and London, each catering for different competencies.  In addition, Local and Regional Divisions of the Court will also be established as appropriate.  </p><p>  My Department is currently examining the potential options for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Unified Patent Court.  The options are to confer jurisdiction on the central division in Paris alone, to set up a local division of the Court or, to participate in a regional division of the Court with one or more Member States.</p><p>  Of course all of these options must be fully considered, including cost considerations, in order for Government to decide what is the most efficient and effective means of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Unified Patent Court.  In this context, my officials are currently consulting with key stakeholders to ensure that all of the policy choices are well informed.</p><p>  As the international agreement on the Unified Patent Court entails a transfer of jurisdiction from an Irish court to an international court, an amendment to the Constitution, requiring the carrying of a referendum, is necessary before Ireland can ratify the Agreement.  The Taoiseach has previously indicated that this referendum will take place in 2014.</p></reply>

In relation to the employment relationship, responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  Enterprise policy and equality issues come within the respective remit of my colleagues, the Minster for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  It is also recognised that the range of policy areas which influence working and retirement decisions fall within the remit of a range of departments and requires a co-ordinated responses if labour market participation rates and effective retirement ages of older workers are to improve.  In this regard, an Interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group is currently considering cross departmental policy issues that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  This Group is considering the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers and will prepare preliminary proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers. </p><p>  In terms of State pension reform measures, increasing State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) are steps that have been taken to ensure the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. </p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.   State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.   </p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65, all short term schemes are payable up to age 66.   The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before State pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  Where a person does not meet the qualifying conditions for insurance based schemes, assistance schemes may be available to them provided they meet the qualifying conditions for these schemes.   Further consideration is being given to the position of those exiting the workforce before pension age.</p></reply>

Community Employment (CE) schemes are also available to people with disabilities.</p><p>  In relation to activation measures for people with disabilities, I would also like to point out that I launched the Disability Activation Project at the end of 2012.  This is providing over &euro;7 million to 14 projects (which will run until early 2015) across the BMW region to address four specific strands around the employment of people with disabilities : (i) Improving Access to Employment, (ii) Progression Programmes for Young People,(iii) Support for Progression and Retention of People with an Acquired Disability; and (iv) Innovative Employer Initiatives.</p><p>  I am confident that these projects will provide invaluable guidance and learning on how best to ensure that the untapped potential of people with disabilities is allowed to flourish and that they are enabled to participate fully in the labour market. The outcomes of these projects will be crucial in determining the optimum approaches which can be taken in relation to mainstreaming activation measures generally for people with disabilities. In the meantime, while priority is being given to unemployed people on the Live Register in terms of the INTREO service at the moment, it is open to any person with a disability to apply to avail of the service.</p></reply>

Details of these Acts are set out in the attached table.</p><p>Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) are not ordinarily undertaken in relation to the package of measures announced in the annual Budget Day Statements or similar packages of measures.  Accordingly, a RIA was not considered necessary in the case of the Social Welfare Act 2011 and the Social Welfare Act 2012, both of which enacted social welfare measures announced in the 2012 and 2013 Budgets, respectively.  A RIA was not considered necessary in the case of the social welfare measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 and the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, as these measures either implemented budgetary decisions or made miscellaneous amendments to the social welfare code which were not considered amenable to the undertaking of a RIA.</p><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Acts of 2011 and 2012 and the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 also amend the provisions of the Pensions Act 1990.  Part 4 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 transposed Article 17 of Directive 2003/41/EC on the Activities and Supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPS Directive) relating to the regulation of occupational pensions.  However, as the types of pension scheme envisaged in Article 17 are not operated in Ireland, a RIA was not considered feasible in relation to these provisions.</p><p>Part 3 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 amended the Funding Standard applying to defined benefit pension schemes.

Child benefit is paid to around 606,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion. Child benefit as a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; payment is paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability. </p><p>  The Department currently notify around 48,000 customers each year that child benefit for their child has ceased because of their child turning 18 years of age.  Data as to whether these children are still in education at the time of the 18th birthday are not available. </p><p>  Budget 2009 provided for the reduction of the age for which child benefit is paid from under 19 years of age to under 18 years of age. This measure was implemented in full in 2011 and has resulted in savings of &euro;79 million on an annual basis.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the 18 year age limit for child benefit. I have no immediate plans to make any changes to the age threshold for child benefit.</p><p>  Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including;</p><p>  - Qualified child increases to primary social welfare payments in receipt of either;</p><p>  - The family income supplement (FIS), which is paid to low paid employees with children and is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments;</p><p>  - The back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which provides a one-off payment to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn.</p><p>  On a more general level, the range of child and family income supports raises issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the supports provided to families and their children. In 2011, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, to recommend cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. I am considering the Group&rsquo;s report on the restructuring of child and family income supports into a more effective and efficient two-tier child and family income support system.</p></reply>

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). Broadband services are provided by a number of commercial service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite. Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware from my response to his previous Question on 10 July 2013, the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas. The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.</p><p>  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The 2011 Bill itself was enacted on 23 November 2011 as the Access to Central Treasury Funds (Commission for Energy Regulation) Act 2011.</p><p>  The second was the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011. A RIA for the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 was published with the Bill on the 27 September 2011. The Bill, Explanatory Memoranda and RIA were made available on my Department&rsquo;s website and also on the Oireachtas website. The Bill itself was enacted on the 25 February 2012 as the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2012.</p><p>  The third was the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy)(Amendment) Bill 2012. This was emergency legislation on foot of a Supreme Court Decision and therefore was exempt from RIA requirements. The Bill itself was enacted on 25 May 2012 as the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy)(Amendment) Act 2012. In addition to the above, the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, while not initiated by me, was enacted on 2 August 2011.</p><p>  A further Bill, the Gas Regulation Bill 2013 was published on 25 July 2013 and is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. A RIA on the Gas Regulation Bill 2013, setting out the policy context and rationale for the implementation of full ownership unbundling, including for the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, was prepared. Some of the material contained in the RIA was considered to be commercially sensitive in light of the ongoing transaction process. Therefore, it is not intended to publish the RIA at this stage.</p><p>  There are a number of other Bills currently in preparation in my Department which will be brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course. My Department undertakes RIA in accordance with the procedures set out in the RIA Guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach. </p></reply>

The award of such licenses, the imposition of terms and conditions to access that spectrum and the associated monitoring of compliance by licensed providers with those terms and conditions are matters for the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Accordingly, I have no statutory power to intervene in the manner suggested by the Deputy. I expect that with the continued significant capital investments being made by mobile operators, the quality of mobile services will continue to improve across the country.

My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the borrower can sustain the loan over the full term. Of equal importance, in view of recent developments in the domestic property market, is the imperative for a local authority to ensure that prudence and pragmatism are applied to all aspects of the management of its housing loans book. In a time of limited resources, deploying those resources in a focused and effective manner ensures the management of its loans portfolio can be achieved as efficiently as possible.</p><p>  The current credit policy has been in effect since 2009. It was deemed appropriate at that time to update the elements associated with local authority lending and to have a homogenous regime in place that ensured best practice was followed across the sector. All applicants are now assessed according to the same criteria, and their applications subjected to the same independent scrutiny. Underwriting of the application by the Irish Credit Bureau is an intrinsic element of that independent scrutiny. This approach represents prudent lending practice , and the current guidelines achieve equitable consideration of all applications. There is anecdotal evidence that loans issued since the introduction of the revised credit policy are more likely to be fully performing. I consider that the current mortgage loan model is fair, adequately meets the needs of prospective borrowers, and facilitates participation in housing acquisition initiatives such as the tenant purchase schemes.</p></reply>

To this end, they have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. I expect local authorities to use their statutory powers as they consider appropriate.</p><p>  Section 23 of this Act provides that a levy may be charged by a local authority on any urban land which is entered on the derelict site register and in respect of which a market value has been determined. This levy must be paid by the owner of the urban land to the local authority in whose functional area the land is situated. The levy is payable until the dereliction ceases. </p><p>  The National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments (NCC), which I chair, identified the 1990 Act as a potential legal instrument that could be used by local authorities as part of a range of measures to deal with the problems generated by, for example, unfinished housing developments. Part of the work of the NCC involved an assessment of the adequacy of existing legislation in tackling the issues associated with unfinished housing developments. Its remit was to review legislation such as the Derelict Sites Act 1990; the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010 and the Water Services Act, 2007 with a view to strengthening or amending provisions to take account of the issues associated with unfinished developments. It concluded that the existing legislation was adequate and no amending legislation was necessary.   </p><p>  While I have no plans to amend the Derelict Sites Act at this time, I will keep the need for further legislative reforms to assist local authorities in addressing the issues of dereliction, including unfinished or unoccupied estates, under review. </p></reply>

The Occupiers Liability Act of 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, but the upfront costs of successfully defending a claim from a recreational user can be significant. In that regard, the proposed indemnity scheme would remove the burden of dealing with insurance companies and engaging legal advisors from any landowner faced with the prospect of a claim arising from injury or damage to the property of a recreational user.   </p><p>  There are a number of important issues and technical matters to be addressed as part of this process. In addition, a comprehensive and robust risk assessment model must be developed and subsequent risk management processes identified and put in place. Initially it was envisaged that individual indemnity schemes would be provided to facilitate Mountain Access and other recreational projects in specific areas. However, due to the administrative and financial costs associated with such a fragmented approach, it was determined that the possibility of introducing a National Indemnity Scheme that could be administered in a more efficient and cost effective manner should be investigated.</p><p>  Progress to date has been positive following meetings with farming organisations and with the State Claims Agency but a number of issues still remain to be finalised. It is hoped that a National Indemnity Scheme can be implemented in 2014.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.</p><p>Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing which is financed from my Department&rsquo;s capital allocations for social housing, Traveller-specific accommodation, private housing assisted by the housing authority or voluntary organisations, private rented accommodation and through their own resources. It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation; including Traveller-specific accommodation and local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes are intended to reflect these preferences. My Department provides 100% capital funding for Traveller-specific accommodation and also provides funding for accommodation related supports to operate in tandem with the capital programme.</p><p>In accordance with the 1998 Act, housing authorities are statutorily required to prepare and adopt multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes for their areas. The current round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes for the period 2009 - 2013 are due to be completed in December and authorities are currently making arrangements for the next round of programmes which will run from 2014 to 2018. In preparing their Traveller Accommodation Programmes, housing authorities are required to identify the accommodation needs of Traveller families within their functional area and to set out how these needs are to be met, using all the housing supply options available to housing authorities including through Traveller-specific accommodation.</p><p>The Government remains committed to meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers. Since the adoption of the third round of programmes in 2009, it is estimated that over 450 units of Traveller-specific accommodation had been provided to end 2012, supported by the provision of approximately &euro;50 million in capital funding from my Department. Over &euro;7 million is being provided for Traveller accommodation purposes this year.  This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority housing and other housing supports. The results of this substantial financial commitment are reflected in the significant reduction in the numbers of Traveller families on unauthorised sites, notwithstanding the steady increase in the numbers of Traveller families nationally over recent years.</p><p>The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) is a statutory body established for the purposes of advising me on all matters relating to housing for Travellers. This committee includes representation from local authorities, other Government Departments and Traveller groups. The fifth such committee since the enactment of the 1998 legislation held its first meeting last week and has already set about preparing its work programme for the next three years. A proposal for a statutory Traveller accommodation agency, as set out in the 1995 Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, was considered by my Department. However, it was subsequently decided not to establish such an Agency and, having regard to the inclusive and effective consultation arrangements already in place through the NTACC, I have no plans to review the matter.</p><p>Details of the capital allocations to housing authorities over the past 10 years for Traveller-specific accommodation, the amounts recouped by my Department and the overspend/underspend in each of these years are set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Allocation &euro;m</th><th>Amounts recouped <br />to LA's &euro;m</th><th>Underspend/<br />Overspend &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>23.12</td><td>26.64</td><td>3.52</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>30.00</td><td>28.95</td><td>-1.05</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>40.00</td><td>35.69</td><td>-4.31</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>45.00</td><td>37.00</td><td>-8.00</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>45.51</td><td>35.56</td><td>-9.96</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>39.00</td><td>35.00</td><td>-4.00</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>40.00</td><td>35.00</td><td>-5.00</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>35.00</td><td>19.60</td><td>-15.40</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>35.00</td><td>16.11</td><td>-18.89</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>15.00</td><td>9.32</td><td>-5.69</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>6.00</td><td>4.00</td><td>-2.00</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>353.63</td><td>282.87</td><td>-70.77</td></tr></table></p><p>Over this 10-year period, housing authorities have drawn down almost 80% of the available capital allocations. Due to a range of issues associated with the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation projects, some local authorities were unable to draw down their full capital allocation. When requested by my Department to account for variations between Traveller accommodation targets and output, housing authorities cited a number of reasons including Traveller families refusing offers of accommodation, families only willing to live in certain areas where housing availability may be an issue, difficulties in obtaining Traveller agreement locally, planning and legal problems, difficulties in obtaining site access and anti-social behavior by Traveler families which can delay development of projects.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i>, which was published on 6 September 2012, indicated that on Census night, 10 April, 2011, a total of 3,808 individuals were sleeping rough or housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term. Of this total, some 163 Irish Travellers were enumerated as homeless, making up just over 4 per cent of the homeless population.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Plan, all materials used in construction should be assessed for environmental impacts (including carbon reduction) over the appropriate appraisal period for the project. Public procurers should consider the impacts of the most commonly used materials including embodied energy (and associated CO2 and other pollutants) and should ensure that the environmental advantages claimed by material suppliers can be verified.</p></reply>

In the present economic circumstances it is understandable that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans has become restricted and a number of loans have fallen into arrears. </p><p>  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned. </p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in July 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This has further enabled local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty. Furthermore, my Department is currently reviewing the Central Bank&rsquo;s most recent Code of Conduct which issued in July 2013, and will update the local authority code where appropriate.</p><p>  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, has presented borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these guidelines has standardised the approach across the whole sector, introduced a systematic structure to this area and provided borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution. </p><p>  My department has no record of any recent submissions from the City and County Managers Association in this regard.</p></reply>

This funding was originally drawn from the National Lottery surplus but, as with other National Lottery funded subheads, it is now drawn also from exchequer funds.</p><p>  Because of the urgent need to make savings in Government expenditure, this Scheme cannot be sustained in the current circumstances.   Beneficiaries were advised in October 2012 that it would be phased out on a gradual basis over a 3 year period, with the first reduction taking effect in late 2013. This is   in order to give affected organisations as much time as possible to adjust to the change and to consider how they may increase the funding they receive through other fundraising projects. As the decision to phase out the Scheme is currently the subject of legal proceedings initiated by The Rehab Group and Rehab Lotteries, I am not in a position to comment further in relation to this issue, at this time.</p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that provision for an increase in the prize fund limits applicable to private charitable lotteries is included in the National Lottery Act 2013 which is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I understand that it is the intention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to commence this provision shortly. This will update the total prize fund limit for lotteries held under section 27 of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act from &pound;3,000, where it has stood since 1987, to &euro;5,000. For lotteries held under section 28 of the 1956 Act, the limit will increase from &euro;20,000 (set in 2002) to &euro;30,000.</p><p>  Separately, in July 2013, the Government approved the General Scheme of a Gambling Control Bill, which will update our laws on gambling, and will involve the repeal of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act.  This legislation will cover lotteries, but will exclude the National Lottery.  The General Scheme, which is available on my Department's website, sets out the proposed increases in prize fund limits for lotteries that fall within the remit of this proposed legislation. The General Scheme has been referred to the Attorney General's Office for formal legal drafting.  It is anticipated that this will be a lengthy process, given the complexities of the issues involved.</p></reply>

The Courts Service is continuing to consider possibilities within the limits of its capital budget and will continue to do so should other opportunities present in the future.</p><p>  The provision of a new Garda Divisional Headquarters in Galway was included in the special Government stimulus package announced in July 2012.

The application is currently being processed and once completed will be returned to the registered organisation concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the number of vetting applications received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) each year has risen from 187,864 in 2007 to 327,903 in 2012 and it is expected that there will be upwards of 350,000 applications this year.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nonetheless, this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. This improvement reflects the fact that I have given this matter particular priority as it is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.</p><p>  In that context,  I have been actively engaged on this issue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 136 whole time equivalent staff assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170, more than double that of the average allocation of 78 staff at the Unit over the past two and a half years.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place during late 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

However, records indicate that the person concerned has made three visa applications in 2010, 2011 and in 2012. All applications were for short stay visits, i.e, of less than 90 days, to Ireland. These three applications were, following full consideration by the visa officer concerned, refused.</p><p>  The most recent application was refused on 17 July 2012 and the decision to refuse was upheld by an appeals officer on 18 October 2012.  The visa appeals officer did not consider that the person concerned provided sufficient evidence of her obligations to return home following a visit to Ireland and had concerns that she would not observe the conditions of a visa were it to be approved.  Furthermore, the person concerned was requested by the visa appeals officer to provide a copy of a letter of refusal of a UK visa application.  This was not provided.  The visa appeals officer had concerns that the person may attempt to use the common travel area between the UK and Ireland to enter the UK unlawfully.</p><p>  It is open to the person concerned to make a new application should she so wish. Where doing so, the applicant should be in a position to address the reasons for the refusal, in particular in this case, by showing stronger evidence of obligations to return home on the expiration of the permission to remain in Ireland. Guidelines regarding the visa  application procedure are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service - .</p><p>  Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.     </p></reply>

However, he will also be aware of the numerous studies and reports over many years on the reform of our laws on gambling, the most recent being in 2010. Almost all of those earlier reports entailed a level of consultation. </p><p>  On taking office in March 2011, I decided that the time had come to move to the next stage, i.e. to prepare legislative proposals, with the result that in July, the Government approved the General Scheme mentioned above. My Department took account of those previous consultations when preparing the General Scheme.   </p><p>  I considered it important to hear from as wide a range of opinion as possible about the proposals in the Scheme. I therefore decided to avail of the new enhanced Oireachtas scrutiny procedures. I wrote to the Chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in July requesting that the Committee should furnish to me its views on the General Scheme by the end of October. </p><p>  The General Scheme was also published on my Department's website within days of it being approved by the Government.</p><p>  The Deputy is, of course, aware that the Oireachtas, including its Committees, has full discretion on the conduct of its business. In the present case, the Committee decided to invite written and, later, oral presentations on the Scheme. I understand the Joint Committee is now preparing its Report. </p><p>  Separately from the work of the Joint Committee, the General Scheme has been submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. That Office has responsibility for the drafting of legislation. The Committee's Report and any recommendations it may contain will be given full consideration as drafting  progresses. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the broad scope and complexity of the Scheme. Bearing that and the workload of the Office in mind, I am unable at this time to give a firm indication as to when the Bill will be published but I do not anticipate publication until the second half of 2014 at the earliest. However, I should add that the very positive reaction to my Scheme, as evident from the presentations to the Joint Committee, is very encouraging. I am looking forward to receiving the Joint Committee's Report. I expect it will be of assistance in having the drafting completed as early as possible. </p></reply>

In the course of preparing that Scheme, my Department examined relevant provisions in the laws of many other jurisdictions, including Italy, and, where appropriate, drew on those provisions in framing the proposals appropriate to this jurisdiction. </p><p>  I note the Deputy's reference to &quot;eliminating revenue avoidance&quot;. It is important to understand the role of the proposed Gambling Control Bill in relation to taxation and revenue matters. Although not concerned with taxation, the new legislation will, nevertheless, be of assistance to the Revenue Commissioners in identifying those liable to taxation in the gambling sector. This will come about because the new legislation will provide that only licensed operators may offer gambling services and it will also provide the means to ensure compliance with that  requirement. The Revenue Commissioners can therefore rely on the licensing system to identify all those liable under the relevant taxation provisions. </p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that I, as Minister, have no role in relation to the conduct of business by Committees and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the correspondence in question. </p><p>  However, on the question of the Scheme's treatment of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, I draw attention to Head 49, in particular to paragraphs (2) and (7) of that Head. Paragraph (7) provides for a ban on FOBT in this jurisdiction and gives effect to the Government's policy on FOBT. Paragraph (2) provides powers to 'prohibit or restrict' any device, game, etc. It is available to deal with as yet unknown risks, be they from new devices, games, etc that may emerge in the future or from existing devices, etc where new evidence demonstrates a serious risk of harm. As can be seen, Head 49 provides a mechanism that will ensure a high level of protection for consumers when the evidence supports the need for action. </p></reply>

The last such discussion took place in 2008.  To this end, the European Council on 13 -14 December 2012 adopted brief procedural conclusions inviting the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Cathy Ashton, and the Commission, inter alia, to develop further proposals and actions to strengthen CSDP and improve the availability of the required civilian and military capabilities.  In summary the conclusions fall into three clusters as follows:</p><p> 1. Increase the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP;</p><p> 2.Enhance the development of defence capabilities;</p><p> 3. Strengthen Europe&rsquo;s defence industry.</p><p>Since the adoption of Council Conclusions in December 2012, Member States have actively addressed this topic through a range of fora, at both political and official level. On 24 July, the Commission&rsquo;s Communication &ldquo;Towards a more competitive and efficient defence and security sector&quot; was published.  The High Representative&rsquo;s (HR&rsquo;s) Report on the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) was circulated on 10 October.  Both documents are currently being considered by my officials in consultation with their colleagues from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of An Taoiseach. They will be on the Agenda for the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers format in Brussels in November and then at the General Affairs Council prior to the European Council.  </p><p>  The forthcoming thematic discussion on Defence issues at European Council meeting of Heads of State and Government in December was a priority issue during Ireland's recent Presidency of the Council of European Union. It was discussed at a number of high level meetings, including the Defence Ministerial which I chaired in Dublin on behalf of the High Representative. Ireland also hosted a presidency seminar on the topic.  </p><p>  It is not possible to say whether the European Council meeting of itself will change the nature of public debate in Ireland.  However, Ireland has been a strong supporter of the role of the EU in international crisis management through CSDP.  There is a need, clearly identified, to ensure that the Union collectively has the capabilities to undertake crisis management operations and for Member States to commit the required capabilities to support operations mandated by the Council.  To this end, it is important that the industrial capacity exists within the Union to provide the requisite capabilities. In the case of the Defence Forces, we rely, in many instances, on European suppliers to provide the Defence Forces with the defence capabilities necessary to undertake the roles assigned to them by Government. How the market can continue to provide the required defence capabilities is among the matters which are due to be discussed in December at the European Council.   </p><p>  In relation to the pooling and sharing of defence resources, this remains a matter for national decision on a case-by-case basis and there is no proposal to change this. The concept of pooling and sharing involves groups of Member States coming together and pooling resources so as to retain, maintain and/or enhance their military capabilities which they can make available for crisis management operations. Ireland is also strongly supportive of initiatives to improve capability development for use in crisis management operations in tandem with other member States.  In this regard, Ireland has participated in the European Defence Agency (EDA) since 2004 and we are involved in a number of EDA programmes in cooperation with other Member States, in areas such as Force Protection, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Protection and Maritime Surveillance. </p></reply>

To  assist in its development, I announced a Beef Genomics Scheme (BGS) yesterday specifically aimed at suckler farmers,  that will help to accelerate the kind of genetic improvement that will drive efficiency and increase profitability at farm level. </p><p>  This scheme will provide vital support for suckler farmers, and begin the process of building a genetic database for the beef sector that will position Ireland as a global leader in beef genetics and ultimately lead to a more efficient and profitable farm sector. </p><p>  I have been able to secure &euro;23 million of funding for this new scheme. The BGS will provide a &euro;40 per calf payment subject to an overall scheme limit. In order to be eligible for the BGS, a farmer must also be in the Beef Data Programme (BDP). Full details of the scheme&rsquo;s terms and conditions will be available from my Department shortly.</p><p>  In addition to the BGS a further &euro;10 million in funding will be paid under the Beef Data Programme (BDP) in 2014. Approximately 34,000 farmers applied for BDP in 2013. This assists farmers in improving the quality of their livestock while maintaining a flow of crucial data to ICBF that will generate further advances in cattle breeding at a national level. Farmers in BDP will receive a further &euro;20 per calf up to a maximum of 20 calves. Added to the BGS Scheme, this will give suckler  farmers  a payment of up to  &euro;60 per calf in 2014.</p><p>  In addition to BGS and BDP a further allocation of &euro;5 million will be made in 2014 so that the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) will continue for another year. Some 5,500 farmers received an annual payment of &euro;925 each under the 2012 programme. </p><p>  In total, these measures, added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme will provide an investment of &euro;40m to suckler farmers in 2014.  </p></reply>

To qualify, the herdowner must comply with the conditions of the BVD Eradication Programme, the statutory basis for which is set out in S.I. 532 of 2012.  In particular, the calves must have had an initial positive or inconclusive test for the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVD), and be removed from the herd, with a date of death notified to the Animal Identification Movement System (AIM).

As a consequence, it is always found in combination with other elements. CAS number 16984-48-8 relates to the fluoride ion. Fluoride compounds have different CAS numbers, e.g.16961-83-4 for Hydrofluosilicic Acid (HFSA), which is used for water fluoridation. The fluoride currently used for water fluoridation is sourced as a primary product. It is mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar as calcium fluoride (CaF2). It then goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce HFSA. It should  also be noted that there are fluoridated public water supplies where there are  existing background levels of naturally occurring fluoride and these levels are  augmented using HFSA to the prescribed optimal  level.</p><p>  The principles for approval of use of HFSA in treatment of water intended for human consumption are no different to those relating to other chemicals used in drinking water treatment, such as disinfectants and coagulants. No water treatment chemical is intended for direct human consumption. The level of fluoride in drinking water in Ireland has been set at between 0.6-0.8 parts per million.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. </p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  </p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process. The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources. </p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  </p><p>  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally. </p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly. It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.   Officials from my Department are currently engaging with the HSE and the NDA to further consider the findings contained in this Report.  </p></reply>

The size of the market can also be a factor in the prices set by manufacturers.</p><p>  In October 2012, Aspen Pharma Trading Ltd  informed the HSE that, following an examination of the viability of a number of product lines, it had decided to increase the price of Purinethol in Ireland and a number of other EU countries (including Germany, UK, Denmark and Finland). </p><p>  The HSE engaged with the company in an attempt to negotiate a lower price, however, it was unwilling to do so.  The HSE was faced with the choice of allowing increased pricing (in line with other international markets) or running the risk that the product would be withdrawn.  Having regard to the importance of the product and the fact that Aspen Pharma Trading Ltd is the sole supplier to the Irish market, the HSE considered that a price increase was necessary to maintain supply and agreed to grant a price increase from 1 March 2013.  Despite the price increase, no other supplier has chosen to enter the Irish market.  Reversal of the price increase in the absence of an alternative supplier could result in the sole supplier exiting the market and patients being left without access to this medicine. </p></reply>

The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual&rsquo;s difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. </p><p>  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents /carers so that they can work to help improve the individual&rsquo;s speech and language. In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate. The HSE has stated that it is committed to working in partnership with other service providers to achieve maximum benefits for children and adults with speech and language therapy requirements, and aims to ensure that, the speech and language therapy resources available are used in the most effective manner possible. </p></reply>

The service is provided by contracted dentists. The HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs. The HSE will continue to monitor the operation of the DTSS to ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of available resources. </p><p>  Responsibility for the Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme rests with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection. Changes introduced in Budget 2010 restricted the treatments available under the Dental Benefit Scheme to an annual free examination. Over 2 million PRSI contributors and their dependant spouses remain eligible for the free dental examination and the other Treatment Benefit schemes.  In 2012 almost 271,000 customers claimed a free dental examination at a cost of &euro;8.9 million.  While all Social Welfare expenditure is kept under review, there are no immediate plans to reverse the changes to the dental benefit scheme in the current budgetary climate.</p><p>  The Department of Health has been unable to fill the post of Chief Dental Officer on a full time basis due to the moratorium on recruitment. Accordingly, it was agreed with the HSE that the HSE National Oral Health Lead would be released to the Department for two days each week to undertake the function of Chief Dental Officer, with effect from 20 May 2013. The arrangement will be reviewed after 3 years. Among the priorities for the Chief Dental Officer is the need to review certain aspects of oral health policy, including training. The Department of Health will engage with the public, the Irish Dental Association and other relevant stakeholders in developing oral health policy, ensuring equity of access and prioritisation of patients with greatest needs.</p></reply>

These are the 375mg and the 625mg strengths.  A shortage of the 375mg tablet is anticipated from November 2013 and a shortage of the 625mg tablet is anticipated from January 2014.</p><p>  According to the manufacturers, GlaxosmithKline (GSK) who advised health professionals on 27th   September of the situation, the shortage arises due to a combination of manufacturing problems at two manufacturing sites in the UK.   At the same time there has been an increase in demand.  The shortage is anticipated to last up to Quarter 3 2014.</p><p>  The shortage is likely to impact not just in Ireland but also in the UK and Europe.  GSK has introduced stock management measures to avoid stockpiling of remaining stocks in a number of markets, including Ireland and the UK.</p><p>  The HSE and the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) have been engaged with GSK and other suppliers to manage the supply problem and to identify alternative sources of supply.   There is one Irish generic manufacturer of co-amoxiclav products which obtains its supplies from a manufacturer other than GSK and the IMB is currently checking with this company to see if it can increase its supply to the Irish market. </p><p>  In addition the IMB has been engaging with Irish manufacturers of co-amoxiclav to see if products manufactured for other markets can be made available on the Irish market or indeed if products manufactured outside of Ireland could also be made available for the Irish market.</p><p>  The HSE has also been engaging with clinical experts to develop prescribing guidelines for clinicians and other health professionals both within hospitals and primary care to identify alternative treatment regimes so that patient care is not compromised in any way.</p><p>  As there are a number of other antibiotics that could be prescribed as alternatives to Augmentin, the HSE is working on developing clinical guidelines for prescribers on prescribing suitable alternatives. This is also an opportunity to emphasise to prescribers that antiobiotics may not be an appropriate treatment depending on the infection eg viral infections.</p><p>  This is going to be an evolving issue over the coming months. It is important to bear in mind however that there is currently no shortage of Augmentin and none is anticipated until November 2013 in respect of one tablet strength and January 2014 in respect of the second tablet strength.   It is extremely important that all stakeholders work together in the meantime to ensure that there is no panic buying which would accelerate the problem. </p></reply>

While symbol F 40 is used to indicate the presence of a speed camera or such cameras along a road, there is presently no <i>Speed Camera</i> symbol within the TSM which displays the speed limit applying in a particular area. To so do so may imply a target, rather than an appropriate limit at which a motorist should drive. Such a scenario may serve to dilute the road safety aspects of <i>Speed Camera</i> signs in safety camera zones which are known to be dangerous locations, where speed related collisions occur. It should also be borne in mind that it is the responsibility of the motorist to be aware of the speed limit of the road on which they are driving.  In terms of giving advance warning of prescribed speed limits in particular speed limit zones, sections 4.5.4 to 4.5.7 of the TSM - <i>Speed Limits Ahead</i> details when the <i>Speed Limit Ahead</i>   sign -  F 401 may be used to warn drivers that they are either approaching a lower speed limit ahead, or approaching a special speed limit or an urban speed limit where the approach speed is likely to be high; i.e. at the approach to a town on a high speed national road.</p><p>  In view of the road safety concerns already outlined, and bearing in mind that there are <i>Repeater Speed Limit</i> signs already in existence on either side of every junction on the road network where the speed limit changes, I see no merit in attaching yet another set of signs to existing <i>Speed Camera</i>   signage. </p></reply>
