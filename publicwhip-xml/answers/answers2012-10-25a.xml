It also serves as a basis for establishing a set of priorities for the coming three-year work cycle which commences with the Irish Presidency.  In particular, the draft EU Youth Report recommends strengthening the link between the EU Youth Strategy and Europe 2020. The draft report states that youth work has the potential to do more in the fields of the EU Youth Strategy including education and training, employment, entrepreneurship, creativity, innovation and social inclusion.  The draft Report will be discussed at the upcoming Council of Youth Ministers meeting in November in which I will participate.</p><p>  This report is timely as it is my aim to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of Ministers with responsibility for Youth Affairs is relevant and responsive to current issues affecting young people in the EU and that our Presidency makes a substantial contribution to the development of both national and EU policy for the coming years. In this regard, Ireland&rsquo;s priority for our Presidency term will focus on the contribution of quality youth work to young people&rsquo;s development and well-being and as a means of achieving positive outcomes for young people in all areas of their lives including vocational and employment readiness.</p><p>  I consider that youth work has a particular relevance and potential when it comes to seeking to support those young people, who may not be in formalised education, in employment or training. This group of young people is a significant concern across all Member States.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency Programme, I plan to host a high-level roundtable event in June 2013 which will explore youth work&rsquo;s contribution to achieving the goals of Europe 2020, including issues relating to youth employment. Officials of  my Department are working closely with other Government Departments including Education and Skills, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection on coordinating the progression of this issue under Ireland's Presidency Programme</p></reply>

While the drafting of the Heads of Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department and consideration of the policy issues in relation to all aspects of the proposed Bill is ongoing, it is intended that the proposed legislation will provide for a structured and regulated way of both safeguarding adoption records and providing access to adoption information.  It is currently intended that the Heads of Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority of Ireland to have responsibility for the safeguarding and maintenance of all adoption records in the State. This will include the establishment of a register of all relevant records held in various locations, which would be maintained by the Adoption Authority.</p><p>  It is also intended that the Heads of Bill will provide that the Authority is to have responsibility for ensuring that access to those records is provided to an adopted person or to a birth parent, in accordance with the Bill. As all persons have a constitutional right to privacy it is envisaged that there may be some restrictions on the information that could be made available without the consent of the parties involved.</p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will establish the National Adoption Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis so that adopted persons, birth parents and others separated as a consequence of an adoption will have access to the tracing and information service. The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  The applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  It is also intended to establish a National Tracing Service on a statutory basis to assist persons who have been separated by adoption and are seeking assistance in tracing or making contact with relatives. It is intended to also provide the Tracing Service to persons who have been separated as a consequence of an &quot;informal arrangement&quot; (for example in the case of an informal or unlawful birth registration where no actual adoption took place).</p><p>  The draft Heads of Bill will be submitted to Government for approval prior to commencing the drafting of the Bill. It is my hope to publish the Bill as early as possible having regard to the current priority workload relating to the Children's Referendum, Adoption (Amendment) Bill and Child and Family Support Agency Bill.  I recently met with the Adoption Rights Alliance and committed to further discussions ahead of publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-25a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102500052#WRA01100"><p>The National Children&#8217;s Strategy was published in November 2000.  The three national goals of the strategy are that:</p><p>1) Children have a voice in matters which affect them;</p><p>2) Children's lives be better understood; and</p><p>3) Children receive quality supports and services.  </p><p>  The National Children&#8217;s Strategy has had considerable impact and has informed the development of a range of policies and services over the intervening period.  My Department has developed a comprehensive programme of <i>children&#8217;s participation</i>   and works with other Departments to ensure that children&#8217;s views are taken into account when developing policies relevant to them.  At county level there are thirty-four Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in place where children and young people can identify priorities and seek to have these addressed.  The D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g is an annual national parliament for young people aged 12 to 18 years.  The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g National Executive follows up on the recommendations from the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and tries to make changes for young people in those areas. The over-riding philosophy underpinning my Department&#8217;s participation activities is that children and young people are the citizens of today and not just the adults of tomorrow.</p><p>  Improved understanding of children&#8217;s lives has been brought about through my Department&#8217;s comprehensive <i>children&#8217;s research programme</i>. This has seen the development of a funded programme of children's research and initiatives to develop research capacity in this area.  It includes the commissioning of the national longitudinal study of children ( through an investment of over &#8364;30 million. The , which is published by my Department biennially, is an important resource in understanding Irish children and placing their experience in an international context.  A detailed review of the progress achieved in the area of children&#8217;s research was completed in the  which I published last year.  This Strategy sets out key priorities in this area over the period 2011 to 2016.</p><p>  There have also been significant developments in the <i>quality supports and services</i> which children benefit from since the National Children&#8217;s Strategy was published in 2000.  Notably the free pre-school year provided through the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme is being made available to 66,000 children at a cost of over &#8364;170 million annually.  My Department has also funded a Prevention and Early Intervention Programme for children in three local areas in conjunction with Atlantic Philanthropies at a total cost over the period of &#8364;36 million.  There is also greater understanding of Child Protection issues than there was in previous decades.  This is reflected in the priorities the Government has attached to establishing the new Child and Family Support Agency, and in legislation regarding the reporting of child abuse.  The forthcoming constitutional referendum and the all-party support it has attracted, demonstrates, I believe, a broader understanding on the importance of the rights of children than existed heretofore.</p><p>  The experience gained from the range of initiatives taken since publication of the National Children&#8217;s Strategy and the views of a wide range of stakeholders are being drawn upon in the development of the Children and Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework.  This includes a consultation with children and young people, in which almost 67,000 participated; an open consultation with the general public which attracted over 1,000 submissions; and the advice of the National Children&#8217;s Advisory Council which comprises representatives of a range of organisations, both statutory and non statutory, that work with children and young people.</p><p>  These consultations have provided a means of reflecting on the experience in implementing the National Children&#8217;s Strategy and the strengths and weaknesses of the achievements. In February 2011 the Children&#8217;s Rights Alliance published an independent review of the implementation of the National Children&#8217;s Strategy.  This was broadly positive in its assessment.  It found that over 80% of the National Strategy&#8217;s 136 Actions have been either achieved or have made some progress.  Therefore, the new Children and Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework will build on the goals of the National Children&#8217;s Strategy. It will cover the 5-year period from 2013 to 2017, and will be the overarching framework for the future development of policies and services that will improve children and young people&#8217;s outcomes.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-25a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102500052#WRA01300"><p>The recent publication of the HSE&#8217;s diocesan audit report represented the culmination of a long process of engagement between the HSE and the diocesan authorities, to establish the position with regard to the Catholic Church, in terms of the safeguarding of children and on responding to allegations of child sexual abuse against members of the clergy.  The Audit highlights recent improvements in church safeguarding practices. However, as I stated on the day of publication, I am concerned by some aspects of the report&#8217;s findings.</p><p>  In particular, the report identifies difficulties in categorising allegations with accuracy in terms of the time taken to report the allegations to the civil authorities. This applies particularly to allegations that were retrospective in nature. There were significant delays in reporting allegations to the civil authorities in the case of some of the dioceses. Also, in some instances dioceses had stated in their audit returns that they had reported all allegations promptly, but the HSE found that this was not the case.</p><p>  I welcome the audits finding that there has been a marked improvement in Church child protection practices in recent years, in particular since the Church&#8217;s new &#8216;Safeguarding Children&#8217; standards were introduced in 2009.  It is also encouraging that the HSE found that the practice of responding to immediate risk to children was found to be generally good and is given priority. The review found that prompt action has been taken by Bishops to remove priests from ministry where allegations have been made.  While the audit highlights recent improvements, it is clear that the focus must remain on addressing the need for ongoing improvements, in particular in those Dioceses identified by the audit as requiring further work.</p><p>  The audit recommends that the State apply &#8220;its resources to intervene and work with all dioceses in a systemic way to address the shortcomings outlined&#8221; and &#8220;to achieve closer monitoring by the State of dioceses&#8221;.  With this in mind I previously requested that Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the HSE&#8217;s National Director for Children and Family Services (and CEO-designate of the new Child and Family Support Agency), engage on an ongoing basis with Mr. Ian Elliott, CEO of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on this issue. The purpose of this engagement is to ensure that the Church has in place all necessary structures and practices to safeguard children in line with the <i>Children First</i>   National Guidance and the Church&#8217;s own guidelines.  This engagement will continue to be prioritised within the new Child and Family Support Agency when established from January, 2013, with a particular focus on dioceses where shortfalls have been identified.  Ensuring compliance with <i>Children First</i>   will be a key priority for the new Agency.</p><p>  I have publicly welcomed the publication by dioceses of reviews carried out by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church. Ten of these reviews have now been published.  The continuation by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church of its robust review process into remaining dioceses and approximately 150 Religious Congregations, together with the HSE&#8217;s review of the Congregations, will provide further transparency in relation to current safeguarding arrangement within the Catholic Church. While there has been very notable improvements compared to historic practices that were entirely unacceptable, there is no room for complacency, as evidenced by the concerns I recently expressed about the outcome of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church review of three Religious Congregations, published in early September of this year.  It is important that the work of the HSE and the NBSCCC be brought to a conclusion as speedily as possible, so as to provide a complete picture of child protection practices and compliance by the Catholic Church.</p></reply>

It is planned to publish the report by the end of the year.  There is no delay in publishing the report, which is a composite work covering three audits in Roscommon, Waterford and Dublin. A decision was taken within the HSE to produce this composite report as the best means of disseminating the learning from the three projects. The report will be based on a sample of 30 cases examined from each of the three areas subject to audit.</p><p>  I previously advised the Deputy (Parliamentary Question Replies 18226/11, 32331/11, 15172/12) that an external consultant conducted a Review of Practice and Audit of the Management of Cases of Neglect in Roscommon, which highlighted both strengths and challenges. Positive outcomes included:</p><p>- Well established multi-disciplinary arrangements and organisational structures which facilitated teamwork and communication;</p><p>- Initial assessments routinely completed;</p><p>- An emphasis on direct work with children and young persons and commitment to listening to children and ensuring their voices were heard.</p><p>  The Review found that in a majority of the cases, staff and managers displayed a commitment to early assessment of need and provided a range of supports to assist children and families, resulting in improved parenting capacity and better outcomes for children.<b></b>  The Review concluded that the challenges involved are similar throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom including the need for more authoritative social work, senior managers reviewing and auditing files, national supervision policy implementation and establishing thresholds for legal intervention in cases.  A Review of Progress was undertaken after three months, and again this had many positive outcomes. Achievements included<b>:</b></p><p>- The recommendations of the Inquiry Report and the Review of Practice and Management of Neglect are being implemented via an Interdisciplinary Child Care Steering group.</p><p>- A monthly child care meeting chaired by the General Manager considers specific developments within the Child Care Service, including budgetary and resourcing issues, waiting lists and individual cases which require to be notified to senior management.</p><p>- The streamlining of Family Support Services to include a single point of entry and realignment across new social work boundaries.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware<i></i>Ready, Steady, Play: A National Play Policy, published in 2004, provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland with the overall aim of ensuring that children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood.  The policy provides a framework for future development of play and looks at a range of issues, including:</p><p>- Guiding principles;</p><p>- A partnership approach between the statutory, community, voluntary and private sectors;</p><p>- Developing infrastructures;</p><p>- Safety and public liability insurance; and</p><p>- Funding arrangements.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Ready, Steady, Play! A National Play Policy in 2004, over &#8364;28 million of Government funding has been expended on improving play infrastructure.  According to the National Play Policy, there were 168 playgrounds in the country in 2004 under the management of Local Authorities. Today there are an estimated 900<b></b>  playgrounds in the country.  Most of these are managed by Local Authorities.  Many Local Authorities have developed world class recreational facilities and integrated play plans benefiting thousands of children and their families.  My Department&#8217;s role is to encourage innovation and a &#8216;joined up&#8217; approach to the development and use of the extensive range of facilities which are now available throughout the country.</p><p>  I established the first ever National Local Authority Play and Recreation network (LAPRN) in February 2012. This brought together for the first time key personnel responsible for implementation of play and recreation policy in local communities across the country. The group has met to date on three occasions. Early achievements are the successful branding and expansion of national play day and national recreation week events as well as improved coordination between local authorities and improved training and networking to increase staff expertise and information sharing.

I have discussed the content of the report in detail with Mr Shatter, Minister for Justice and Equality and Government colleagues and I have been assured that the action plan which has been drawn up by the Irish Prison Service will be implemented as a matter of urgency.  This damning report provides further evidence<i></i>of the fact that accommodating children in adult prison facilities is wrong.  The Programme for Government has a strong commitment to end the practice of detaining children in St. Patrick's Institution and I am determined that this will happen at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  I assumed legal responsibility for the children detention schools in January of this year. An immediate priority of mine was to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment and end the practice of detaining children in St. Patrick's Institution which has been criticised in domestic and international reports for decades. In April, following agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I announced a capital funding package of approximately &#8364;50 million for the project to expand the detention places and facilities on the Oberstown campus in Lusk, Co Dublin.  This will involve the delivery by mid 2014 of sufficient new   facilities to accommodate all children that are subject to detention by the courts. This will allow for the ending of the practice of detaining any person under 18 years in St. Patrick&#8217;s Institution.</p><p>  Although planning for this much needed development has taken place under previous Governments this is the first time that this major construction project has been given the priority and necessary budget to ensure its delivery in the shortest possible timeframe. Since April, work has been ongoing in my Department and the Office of Public Works on the design, statutory planning, logistical and tendering aspects of this project.  The required statutory planning notices were published in August and the public observation period has been completed.  I expect that this process will be finalised in the near future, following discussion between the Office of Public Works and Fingal County Council.  I can also report that tender documentation will issue shortly for the technical specialist contractors for the project and I expect that tender documentation for the main contractor will issue by December.  My aim is to deliver suitable detention facilities on the earliest possible date, in a manner that complies with all design, planning and heath and safety requirements.  I  am also conscious that the Oberstown campus is already the location of the existing children detention facilities and these must remain in operation during the construction project.  </p><p>  As an interim measure, I have also announced the ending of the practice of detaining 16 year old boys in St Patrick&#8217;s Institution from 1 May 2012 by using existing capacity that was available on the Oberstown campus.  Since July there have been no 16 year old boys detained in St Patrick&#8217;s Institution. On foot of legal changes made by me all 16 year old boys are now detained at Oberstown and for the first time are no longer sent to St. Patrick's Institution. In conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Equality, I also extended the remit of the Ombudsman for Children from July 2012 to include all boys under 18 years of age detained in St Patrick&#8217;s Institution. </p><p>  Ending the practice of detaining 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution will be achieved through the provision of further capacity in Oberstown under the capital project now underway.  This is being progressed as quickly as possible.  However, I also intend to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of the 17 year old age group in Oberstown which are currently in St Patrick's Institution before mid 2014.  I have asked the Oberstown Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service to keep this matter under review based on the trend of occupancy in Oberstown under the recent change in age categories and to report to me no later than February 2013 on this matter. </p><p>  With these measures, I am satisfied that substantial progress is being made toward meeting the Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in St Patrick's Institution and I intend that this will be achieved at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. There were 6,258 children in the care of the state in July 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care (5,739) and general residential care (339).</p><p>  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability. The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland.  For this small number of young people, the HSE is on occasion, in exceptional cases, required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and highly-specialised therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child. These placements are made in line with the <i>HSE National Protocol for Special Arrangements</i>   and are made under the order and supervision of the High Court.</p><p>  The Child Care Regulations 1995 apply to all children in the care of the HSE. These regulations provide inter-alia that   <i>'a health board shall satisfy itself in respect of each relevant residential centre that appropriate arrangements are in place to facilitate reasonable access and contact between children residing in the centre and their parents, relatives, friends, or any other persons who, in the opinion of the board, have a bona-fide interest in the children'</i> .  The HSE apply this obligation  to children placed out of State  in secure facilities, unless the Court Ordered Care Order under which the child has been placed stipulates that it is not in the child's best interests.</p><p>  Under the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres, visits from family members and friends are encouraged.  Where a young person has lost contact with family, social worker and staff members actively try to re-establish contact and arrangements are made for supervision of visits if necessary.  Parents are kept informed about events in their child's life and are invited to participate in significant events and appointments.    Where a young person does not have contact with their family the supervising social worker and staff explain the reasons clearly and these are documented in the care plan.</p><p>  The HSE has advised me that as of 22 October 2012, there were seven young people detained in out of State secure placements. Where children are placed abroad they remain in the care of the State, they have an allocated social worker who visits them in their placement, they have a care plan and this is reviewed within the statutory framework. All units in which children are placed are subject to the regulatory and inspection framework of that jurisdiction and HSE Children and Families Services makes itself aware of any reports prior to placing a child abroad. As the Deputy will appreciate, for reasons of confidentially  it would be inappropriate to provide detailed information regarding these young people. However, I am advised by the HSE that family access has been facilitated by the HSE in all except one of these cases, where the HSE offer of access has not been taken up to date. The HSE pay the costs of flights,  ancillary travel expenses and overnight expenses where necessary for the child's social worker and family member/s.</p></reply>

As a society we know that all families need informal supports and that some families in particular need specific supports to care for their children safely and adequately. We have learned through hard lessons that all services that work with children, in particular our child protection services, need to be constantly alert to children&rsquo;s safety and welfare and that in some instances parents may do their upmost to deceive professionals. </p><p>  The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.</p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July and  I thank the Committee for its work on this matter. My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee.</p><p>  HIQA have been provided with additional staff resources to inspect and report on the standard of the HSE's child protection services. These inspections are due to commence shortly.</p><p>  The commitment to establish a new Child and Family Support Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services.  The establishment of a single agency, underpinned by legislation and incorporating key children and family services, will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway under the National Director for Children and Families, Gordon Jeyes.  The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority and it is anticipated that the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this D&aacute;il session. It is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in January 2013. </p><p>  The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency. It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &euro;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team.</p></reply>

The Donegal project started mid-year and the Cork project started in the third quarter.  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin. I have discussed this issue with Gordon Jeyes, National Director for Children and Family Services in the HSE. The HSE is currently addressing the recommendations of the Evaluation Report with a view to developing a proposal for a national model for out of hours service for discussion with my Department. This will facilitate the inclusion of Actions and Targets in the National Services Plan 2013 for future development of out of hours services. Subject to further discussions on the proposed model, I am anticipating that roll out on a phased basis will commence in early 2013.</p><p>  What is important is that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24 hour social work assistance, and this is what the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and I are working towards. Clearly whatever model emerges will need to address the challenges of varying demographic demands in both rural and urban settings. It should be noted that at present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service, and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service.  The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years. The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel. </p><p>  The Emergency Place of Safety Service operates outside the greater Dublin area,  whereby Gardai can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours. This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case. As part of this service Gardai have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.</p></reply>

Responsibility for certain Ministerial functions under this Act came under the remit of my Department with effect from 3 June 2011 by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011 (S.I. 218 of 2011).  However, the Ombudsman for Children is independent in the performance of her functions under the Act and her reporting relationship is to the Oireachtas on these functions. Section 13(7) of the Act requires her to cause a report of her function under this Act to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas annually. The Ombudsman for Children, Ms. Emily Logan, recently launched her annual report for 2011. </p><p>  I believe the Ombudsman for Children performs a valuable ongoing role that goes beyond dealing with complaints against State institutions on matters which affect the lives of children. Her role involves the promotion of the rights and welfare of children and includes:</p><p> - Advising Government on development and coordination of policy relating to children;</p><p> - Encouraging development of policies and practices to promote the rights and welfare of children;</p><p> - Promoting awareness among the public of issues of concern relating to the rights and welfare of children and how those rights can be enforced.</p><p>  One important role she performs is that, occasionally, she challenges the system of public administration to place children more firmly at the centre of its decision making. In the introductory message of her 2011 Report she says <i>&#8220;it is abundantly clear to me that the core principles of best interests and respect for the views of the child are not being respected systematically in Ireland. I have consistently highlighted this in my annual reports to the Oireachtas, across the areas of health, education and justice.&#8221; </i>  This is the challenge for all public bodies to address among our ambitious programme of Public Sector Reform.</p><p>  This Government is committed to putting the rights and welfare of children at the centre of our policy considerations and delivery of services in Ireland. Our forthcoming referendum on the rights of children is clear testament to that commitment. A positive outcome in that referendum will further strengthen the position of children, in particular with regard to their best interests and their views. It will add strength to existing laws and any future laws that require the best interests of the child to be the first and paramount consideration for judges in deciding court cases brought by the State in the area of child protection, or in adoption, guardianship, custody or access proceedings. It will also give recognition, at the constitutional level, to the principle of the child&#8217;s views being a consideration in such proceedings.</p><p>  Earlier this year, I already extended the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to include boys under 18 years of age who are detained in St Patrick&#8217;s Institution.  Following a report on the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 in March 2012 and following consultations with Ms. Logan, the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform Brendan Howlin within the past week proposed changes in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 at Committee Stage in the Seanad which will further expand the remit of both the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  I support the work of the Ombudsman for Children. I will consider, along with my colleagues in Government, the issues raised by Ms. Logan in her report. </p></reply>

Services are planned and delivered in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and national child care policy which provides, inter alia, that services and staff will be:</p><p> - Child Centred: the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration and children&rsquo;s wishes and feelings should be given due regard;</p><p> - Family Oriented: the family generally affords the best environment for raising children and external intervention should be to support and empower families within the community;</p><p> - Equitable:all children should have equality of opportunity in relation to access, to participation in and derive benefit from the services delivered and have the necessary levels of quality support to achieve this. A key priority in promoting a more equitable society for children is to target investment at those most at risk;</p><p> - Inclusive: the diversity of children's experiences, cultures and lifestyles must be recognised and given expression;</p><p> - Action Orientated: service delivery needs to be clearly focused on achieving specified results to agreed standards in a targeted and cost-effective manner;</p><p> - Integrated: measures should be taken in partnership, within and between relevant players, be it the State, the voluntary/community sector and families; services for children should be delivered in a co-ordinated, coherent and effective manner through integrated needs analysis, policy planning and service delivery. </p><p>  In the provision of services the HSE always seeks to ensure that there is an appropriate balance struck between the legislative requirement:</p><p> - to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection;</p><p> - to have regard to the rights and duties of parents; and</p><p> - the need to  have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family.</p><p>  In this regard the HSE Child Protection and Welfare Handbook makes the following two statements:</p><p> - &ldquo;A proper balance must be struck between protecting children and respecting the rights and needs of parents/carers and families. Where there is conflict, the child&rsquo;s welfare must come first&rdquo;;</p><p> - &ldquo;Parents/carers have a right to respect and should be consulted and involved in matters that concern their family&rdquo;.</p><p>  HSE Children and Family Services routinely include parents in child care proceedings including child protection conferences and children in care reviews. In regard to meeting the needs of children who may require special care and protection the HSE is empowered under the Children Act, 2001 to convene a Family Welfare Conference.  In effectively safeguarding the welfare of children the HSE seeks to balance decisive action in the interest of the safety of children with respect for parental and family rights and responsibilities. In this regard the HSE highlights the crucial role of  wider community engagement in safeguarding and emphasizes the need to ensure that safeguarding is on the agenda of community initiatives and that personal responsibility, community contribution and state support are clearly delineated and complementary.</p><p>  The Child Care Act, 1991, is the key piece of legislation governing the role of the State in the area of child protection. This Act makes explicit reference to the rights of parents under the Constitution. The proposed constitutional amendment does not give the State any additional rights to interfere in families - the only circumstances in which the State can intervene is in exceptional cases where the parents fail in their duty towards their children to such an extent that safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected, the State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child. Article 41 - recognising the right of the family and Articles 42.1 - 42.4 recognising the role of the family as the natural educator of the child, remain unchanged. The rights and duties of parents remain unchanged. It remains the prerogative of parents to act as protector of the child's interests and indeed the person best situated to promote the rights of their children under the new Article 42A.1 - save in those exceptional circumstances referred to above where the State must  &quot;supply the place&quot; of parents.</p><p>  In relation to the &quot;best interest&quot; principle - this applies in defined proceedings where there has either been (i) parental failure in the context of care proceeding (ii) adoption or (iii) where the parents (or guardians) of a child are themselves in dispute with each other about the custody and care arrangements for their child. Constitutional recognition of the principle that the best interests of the child should be the paramount consideration in these proceedings means that this principle should now be a determinative factor in the resolution of such proceedings having regard to the constitutional rights of the family, whereas currently the best interests of the child can only be a determinative factor subject to the constitutional rights of the family. </p></reply>

The number of social workers employed in the Children and Families Service area at the end of February 2011 was 1231.  The HSE has made considerable progress over recent years in recruiting additional social workers, with 260 social workers recruited under the Ryan Implementation Plan.

Funding of some &#8364;56.806 is available in 2012 to support the delivery of these services and programmes through the different schemes which include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&#8217;s Facilities and Services Fund, Youth Information Centres, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, the Local Drugs Force Task Scheme and certain other programmes including Gaisce - the President&#8217;s Award.  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth services and communities around the country in some 477 projects.</p><p>  As a support to this significant infrastructure, my Department provides funding for the employment of 24.5 (WTE) Youth Officer posts in VECs throughout the country.  These Youth Officers have an important role to play in the delivery of quality youth services funded by my Department.  They assist my Department also in administering grant-aid funding allocations to the local youth services/clubs in their respective areas.  Youth Officers have a specific function in supporting the implementation of the National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for staff-led youth work around the country and they will have a significant role in the implementation of the forthcoming National Quality Standards for Local Volunteer-led youth groups.</p><p>  One of the core principles of the NQSF and the National Quality Standards is a commitment to ensuring and promoting the safety and well-being of young people.  Youth Officers support youth projects and organisations in working to achieve key indicators in this regard for young people attending services. <i>Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children </i>is being implemented by the youth sector throughout their services with the support of the National Youth Council of Ireland&#8217;s Child Protection Programme which is funded by my Department. The Youth Sector will work closely with the new Child and Family Support Agency to promote children and young people&#8217;s safety and well being.</p><p>  The final report of the Task Force which I established to advise on the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency, made recommendations on a number of key issues. These include recommendations on a range of services, including Child Psychology Services, which, in the opinion of the Task Force, should fall within the remit of the new Agency.  I share with the view of the Task Force, that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p><p>  The Task Force recommendations are being given detailed consideration in preparing for the establishment of the new Agency, and I will bring proposals to Government in this regard. It is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in early 2013. The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority.</p></reply>

The placement of children with relatives in an emergency is covered by Part III of the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995.  A preliminary assessment of suitability is carried out at the time of placement and in the vast majority of cases the full assessment is commenced.  Assessment of suitable candidates for children in care should not be rushed as time is required for all parties to seriously consider the task been undertaken.  The quality of the assessment is more important than the time frame in which it was carried out.  Efforts are ongoing to ensure that all foster carers are fully compliant with regulations and standards, including full vetting. The National Standards for Foster Care in place since 2003 are inspected against by HIQA who have been resourced to undertake an increased rate of inspections commencing later this year.</p></reply>

I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing to this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.  One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the child minding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for under-one age group.</p><p>  At present pre-school services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.</p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.</p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is pro-active in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>  The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation.

I received their comprehensive Report in July and  I thank the Committee for its work on this matter. My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders, and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill in the coming months.</p></reply>

The length of time an aftercare service is provided is dependent upon the assessed needs of the young person, but is generally provided for up to the age of 21 years or 23 if the young person is in education.  Young people in special care and high support have an equitable right to the aftercare service, based on their assessed needs, as any other child in care.</p><p>  The HSE aftercare policy sets out that young people over 16 years of age will have an assessment of need  carried out and a leaving aftercare developed.  This plan is then put into place when the young person leaves care at 18 regardless of the type of setting from which they are discharged.  A young person may access the after care service for an assessment of need at any time up to age 21 even where they have not taken up an offer of aftercare services when they left care at age 18.  As stated above, the basis of the service is an individual needs assessment which identifies a young person&rsquo;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education. The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.  Many young people in foster care remain in their foster care placement as their aftercare support.</p><p>  The HSE National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which was developed in co-operation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies representing children in care and those involved in aftercare provision and my Department.

An effectively managed Presidency will deliver long-term reputational benefit for Ireland.  Short-term benefits include significant benefits for the local economy from an influx of up to 15,000 delegates, press and representatives of NGOs who will use local services including hotels, restaurants, taxis etc. over the six month Presidency period.</p><p>The use of Dublin Castle and a small number of other state-owned venues mainly in Dublin to host most Presidency meetings will reduce venue hire, transport and set-up costs, not to mention significantly reducing the &ldquo;carbon footprint&rdquo; of the Presidency.  The procurement of most logistical requirements for the Presidency is being centralised to reduce costs, reduce administrative burden, and increase efficiencies. Procurement is being carried out on a collaborative basis involving principally my Department, the National Procurement Service and the Office of Public Works. Purchasing is being conducted transparently and on a competitive basis.</p><p>As the planning of the operational elements of the 2013 Presidency are more centralised than for our Presidency in 2004 and because both the configuration of Government Departments and the nature of the Presidency role have changed in the interim, some caution should be exercised in making direct comparisons between expenditure in 2003/4 and expenditure linked to the current Presidency.  Set out below, and drawn from the Appropriation Accounts for 2003 and 2004 and the Revised Estimates Volume for 2012, is a table showing the expenditure specifically incurred or allocated for the Presidency.  In neither case does it take account of expenditure incurred under different account codes that was directed towards the Presidency but which was not directly charged to Presidency allocations.</p><p>Allocations for 2013 have not yet been decided but the Government decided in December 2011 to allocate a total budget in the order of &euro;60m over 2012 and 2013 to resource the Presidency, which excludes security costs. This budget is broadly in line with budgets for recent Presidencies hosted by other EU Member-States.</p><p><table><tr><th>EU Presidency Expenditure</th><th><div>2003</div></th><th><div>2004</div></th><th><div>Allocated 2012</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Department/Office</div></td><td><div>&#8364;'000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;'000</div></td><td><div>&#8364;'000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Taoiseach</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1,568</div></td><td><div>1,950</div></td></tr><tr><td>Finance/Public Expenditure &amp; Reform</td><td><div>312</div></td><td><div>2,863</div></td><td><div>2,338</div></td></tr><tr><td>Justice &amp; Equality</td><td><div>1,023</div></td><td><div>4,122</div></td><td><div>1,264</div></td></tr><tr><td>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td><td><div>1,196</div></td><td><div>33,478</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Environment, Community &amp; Local Government</td><td><div>966</div></td><td><div>2,474</div></td><td><div>632</div></td></tr><tr><td>Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>299</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Affairs and Trade</td><td><div>10,708</div></td><td><div>21,372</div></td><td><div>8,850</div></td></tr><tr><td>Communications, Energy &amp; Natural Resources</td><td><div>563</div></td><td><div>2,522</div></td><td><div>156</div></td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1,119</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobs, Enterprise &amp; Innovation</td><td><div>503</div></td><td><div>2,552</div></td><td><div>1,956</div></td></tr><tr><td>Arts, Heritage &amp; the Gaeltacht</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>3,616</div></td><td><div>1,389</div></td></tr><tr><td>Defence</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1,638</div></td><td><div>49</div></td></tr><tr><td>Office of Public Works</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>4,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Education &amp; Skills</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>175</div></td></tr><tr><td>Social Protection</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Health </td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>300</div></td></tr><tr><td>Children &amp; Youth Affairs</td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>97</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>15,271</div></td><td><div>77,624</div></td><td><div>23,164</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is also considered crucial that the EU retains a sense of partnership via the PEACE fund in the Northern Ireland peace process.

In the period since then the Department&rsquo;s core staffing decreased by approximately 190, or about 12%.  Predictably, senior levels were most severely affected and, in the circumstances, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently approved the filling of some of the critical gaps that had arisen at these levels, particularly since the end of the pensions &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; on 29 February 2012.

There are, in all, three separate Group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p>Group A: &#8364;250,000<b> - </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and also foster children who satisfy certain conditions  ) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p>Group B: &#8364;33,500<b> &#8211;</b>  applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece, or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p>Group C: &#8364;16,750<b> - </b>  applies in all other cases.</p><p>The Group A tax-free threshold of &#8364;250,000 applies to a foster child in the following circumstances:</p><p>  (i) in the case of a gift or inheritance, where the foster child has resided with the disponer foster parent and was under the care of and maintained by that foster parent at that foster parent&#8217;s own expense throughout a period or periods totalling at least five years in the first 18 years of life of the foster child; or</p><p>  (ii)in the case of an inheritance taken on the date of death of the foster parent, where the foster child had, prior to that date, been placed in the foster care of the foster parent under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995.</p><p>  Accordingly, in a situation where a person has resided with a foster parent for all of their life into young adulthood and, where the person has been cared for and maintained by the foster parent at the foster parent&#8217;s own expense for at least five years prior to attaining eighteen years of age, that foster child is entitled to claim the Group A tax-free threshold of &#8364;250,000 for Gift and Inheritance Tax purposes in the same manner as a natural child of the foster parent. The foster child is not discriminated against in those circumstances. </p><p>  Separately, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code completely exempts an inheritance of a dwelling house from inheritance tax in certain circumstances. The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the dwelling house for a minimum of three years immediately prior to the inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling house. In addition, the beneficiary must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of six years from the date of the gift or inheritance.</p><p>  This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be subject of any inheritance tax when it is transferred on a person&#8217;s death.  </p><p>  The dwelling-house exemption is available to any beneficiary who meets the conditions for the exemption irrespective of whether or not they are related to the disponer of the inheritance and irrespective of the value of the dwelling house being transferred. Accordingly, this exemption would apply to a foster child if he or she satisfied the conditions governing the exemption.</p></reply>

The legislation which established the NTMA positioned it outside of the wider public service structures with operational freedom to negotiate market competitive salaries so that it would have, for example, the flexibility to recruit and retain specialists in mid-career from the private sector.    This business model has been essential in enabling the NTMA to staff itself with the necessary technical expertise to successfully carry out the financial and risk management functions which have been assigned to it. Indeed the NTMA has been required to recruit very actively in the market over the last two and a half years in respect of NAMA, banking system functions and NewERA. In the case of NAMA, most people are employed on the basis of specified purpose contracts, which means that as NAMA winds down and certain functions cease, their term of employment will come to an end.</p><p>  The public sector pension deduction provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 applies to all NTMA staff. The NTMA was not subject to the general reductions in salaries provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 on the basis it would avail of the flexibility inherent in its remuneration model to deliver payroll savings. In 2010 it secured a reduction of some 8% in overall payroll costs, on a like-for-like basis compared with the previous year, through a reduction in the performance-related element of overall remuneration. In 2011, it secured a further reduction of almost 3% in overall payroll costs, again on a like-for-like basis.    </p><p>  In addition, all fifteen NTMA employees whose salaries exceed &euro;200,000 agreed to my request of December 2011 that they waive 15% of salary or such amount of salary as exceeds &euro;200,000 if application of the full 15% reduction would bring their salary to below &euro;200,000.</p></reply>

In Ireland the zero rate applies to printed books, including atlases, children&rsquo;s picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music.  It is possible for Ireland to apply the zero rate to printed books because Ireland applied the zero rate to these books on and before 1 January 1991, and the EU VAT Directive provides a derogation for such exceptional VAT treatment to continue to apply.  However, the VAT Directive does not allow goods and services to apply at the zero rate which were not in place at that rate on 1 January 1991.  As e-books were not applied at the zero rate in 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to them now.   Furthermore, under the EU VAT Directive, all digitised publications, regardless of their rate when printed (for example, a book liable at zero rate), are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT, which in Ireland is 23%. E-books, online newspaper subscriptions and online information services purchased via download over the Internet are also considered the supply of services liable for VAT at the standard rate. There is no option under EU VAT law to exempt e-books from VAT or to apply a reduced rate to them.  While it is possible to reduce the standard VAT rate on e-books to below 23%, such a reduction would have to apply to all goods and services at the standard VAT rate, which accounts for the majority of activity liable to VAT, and would be excessively costly to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

They are also paid free of the Universal Social Charge (USC).</p><p> - The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. (This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.) No USC is chargeable.</p><p> - Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed under Schedule E and collected under the PAYE system (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is also chargeable on the excess.</p><p>  These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums taken since 7 December 2005 aggregating with later lump sums.

In addition the amount of profits and gains generated by the investments held by those pension schemes is exempt from tax.   Pension benefits are taxable at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, so the amount of tax due will depend on the individual&rsquo;s personal circumstances. There may be an opportunity to take part of the pension benefit as a tax-free lump sum but this depends on the rules of the pension scheme and is subject to an overall limit of &euro;200,000.

EU VAT rules provide that a standard VAT rate of between 15% and 25% applies to the supply of all goods and services with certain derogations.  Annex III of the VAT Directive provides a list of goods and services to which Member States may apply a reduced rate of between 5% and 15% (with Member States applying no more than 2 reduced rates).  In addition, various derogrations apply whereby Member States may retain historic VAT rates on specific goods and services where those VAT rates applied on 1 January 1991.   In Ireland most food applies at the zero rate of VAT, this includes bread, butter, tea, sugar, meat, milk, and vegetables.  This is a derogation from EU VAT law, as described above, as food applied at the zero rate in 1991.  Bakery products, for example cakes, crackers, certain wafers, croissants and biscuits operate at the 13.5% reduced VAT rate. This is also an historical VAT treatment.  In this regard, all other food and drink apply at the standard VAT rate, such as alcohol, soft drinks, bottled waters and health drinks soft drinks, sweets and chocolate and similar confectionery, wafers and biscuits covered with chocolate or other similar product, ice-cream and ice-lollypops, potato and similar crisps, popcorn, salted and roasted peanuts.</p></reply>

Most schemes would have a normal retirement age of 65. Revenue approval may also provide, however, for early retirement from age 50 where scheme rules allow and with the employer&rsquo;s consent. In such situations benefits are restricted.    In the case of personal pensions such as retirement annuity contracts (RACs) and  Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) benefits can be taken from age 60 with no retirement condition. Buy-out bonds, which are a special type of defined contribution plan which can be availed of by members of occupational pension schemes leaving service or where schemes are winding-up can normally take benefits at any time from age 50.  </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in relation to all of these pension arrangements benefits can be taken at any stage where retirement is due to serious ill-health or incapacity. I have no plans to amend the above arrangements for accessing pension benefits. </p><p>  There are a number of reasons why, under existing policies, early withdrawals of pension savings are not permitted, the principal one being that pension schemes and plans (and the associated tax reliefs) are designed as long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the savings will be &ldquo;locked away&rdquo; until retirement. This, in effect, is the quid pro quo for the tax relief which is available to encourage long term saving for retirement.  </p><p>  A number of proposals have been made that individuals should be allowed access to their pension savings prior to retirement. Various rationales have been advanced to justify these proposals including that such access would allow those individuals to pay down mortgage and other debt and would otherwise provide a boost to economic activity.  This is not a simple matter. During 2011, at the request of the Government&rsquo;s Economic Management Council (EMC), an Ad-hoc group was established under the chairmanship of the Department of Social Protection to consider the idea of allowing people to access their pension savings before pension age in order to assist them in paying down debt. The ad-hoc group presented a detailed report to the EMC in September 2011.   The conclusions of the Ad-hoc Group report were that:</p><p> - There is no evidence that, in general, the group likely to be most affected by mortgage debt (or other debt) has access to sufficient pension savings to make a difference to their situation.</p><p> - The legislative and administrative implications for such a scheme would be extremely complex and would appear excessive given the overall impact.</p><p> - Longer term difficulties whereby people are not making adequate provision for their retirement would be exacerbated, with potential for increased demands on the State.</p><p> - Individuals cashing in their pension savings now would get poor value in current circumstances which they would struggle to replace in the future.</p><p>  The &ldquo;Keane Group&rdquo; on mortgage arrears did not dispute these findings and early access to pension savings did not feature among the recommendations of that Group.  A more general scheme of early access to pension savings would present significant problems in terms of the proper targeting of the use of accessed funds and controls over potential abuse.</p><p>  The tax treatment of pension savings for which I have responsibility is only one aspect of the broad policy of encouraging people to provide for an adequate income in retirement beyond the basic State pension. This policy area is the responsibility of my colleague, Ms Joan Burton TD, Minister for Social Protection, who I know is also aware of the proposals being made for early access to pension savings. The OECD is currently carrying out an independent review of long term pension policy in Ireland on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection. I have been advised, in response to a request from me in this matter, that the terms of reference of the independent review are such as to facilitate consideration of the issue of early access to pension savings and I would expect that the OECD review would deal with this issue.</p></reply>

As part of this on-going and wide-ranging work, my Department examines the issue of debt sustainability. Indeed, section 4.5 of the November 2011 Medium-Term Fiscal Statement deals exclusively with an analysis of debt sustainability, outlining alternative trajectories for the debt/GDP ratio corresponding to different assumptions about the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate. Our current debt/GDP ratio is very high and stabilizing and subsequently reducing it is one of the Government&rsquo;s key policy objectives. In that regard, the end-June euro area summit and more subsequent development signalling that the situation of the Irish financial sector would be examined. </p><p>  In addition to my Department's own internal analysis, as part of the seventh review of the financial assistance programme, which took place in July 2012, the IMF undertook an analysis of the possible effects on the debt-sustainability of the Irish sovereign of various modes of financing could be. For illustrative purposes, scenarios considered included consideration of the promissory notes. The Fund concluded that the improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s debt dynamics would depend on the modalities and the quantum under consideration.  On-going discussions with the Troika are considering all options for the restructuring of the promissory notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate applicable etc. As the Deputy would expect our analysis is on-going and is regularly updated in the context of these discussions.</p></reply>

Fiscal consolidation reduces the fiscal deficit and increases investor confidence which in turn lowers the cost of borrowing and helps to put public debt on a declining path.  Having said that I fully recognise that there will be a short term reduction in output before these medium term benefits are realised. So it is a difficult balancing act between the need for consolidation on the one hand and the need to support the emerging recovery on the other. There is, I think it is fair to say, an acknowledgement among many commentators that we in Government are getting this balance right.</p><p>  The recent IMF World Economic Outlook suggests that the average size of fiscal multipliers (the effect of consolidation on growth) across countries may have been underestimated in recent years. More recently, senior IMF staff tasked with monitoring developments in Ireland pointed to the multiplicity of factors at play in acting as a dampener on growth and acknowledged that there was no convincing evidence that the fiscal multiplier for Ireland was underestimated compared with that assumed under the programme. </p><p>  Ireland is a small, open economy with imports accounting for over three quarters of GDP. This means that a considerable amount of consolidation leaks out through reduced demand in countries we import from. We can already see this in the Balance of Payments figure, which shows the current account moving from a deficit of -5.7% of GDP in 2008 to a surplus of 1.1% in 2011.  Fiscal multipliers vary according to the fiscal instruments used, and the impact on aggregate demand as a result of expenditure changes can differ from tax changes. I would reiterate the Government&rsquo;s cognisance of this and its commitment to implementing consolidation in as growth-friendly a manner as possible.</p><p>  In order to correct our excessive deficit and minimise the cost to the taxpayer through sustaining investor confidence and keeping the cost of borrowing as low as possible, Ireland is committed to implementing further consolidation over the next three years. Evidence of the rewards associated with this approach is already visible through the lowering of bond yields since early summer and the successful return of the NTMA to the debt market. </p></reply>

Mortgage interest relief is provided to mortgage holders via on-going electronic data file transfers between Revenue and each of the 132 individual qualifying lenders.  Both Revenue and the lenders were required to upgrade their IT systems to facilitate payment of the new 30% rate announced in Budget 2012, and while Revenue upgraded its IT system in December 2011, the same speed of upgrade did not happen across all of the lenders. At this point there is only one lender who has not completed the necessary upgrades to facilitate payment of the new 30% rate to its customers.</p><p>  Revenue is currently in direct contact with that lender to ensure the 30% rate is paid to its customers within the current year and applied retrospectively. The lender has assured Revenue that its IT system will be upgraded within the current tax year and the 30% rate will be paid to its customers.   It should be noted that the customers affected have continued to receive mortgage interest relief at the old 25% rate while the lender&rsquo;s IT system upgrades are being completed. </p></reply>

The Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 established the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), one of whose key functions is &ldquo;to supervise how the prescribed accountancy bodies regulate and monitor their members&rdquo; (section 8 of the Act).  Since the coming into operation of the 2003 Act and the establishment of IAASA, the system for the regulation and supervision of the accountancy and auditing profession is one of regulation by the profession under independent supervision by a statutory authority.  In practice, this means a person who is not satisfied that an accountant or auditor, having membership of a prescribed accountancy body, has properly discharged his or her responsibilities can lodge a complaint with the body in question, which must then apply its investigation and disciplinary procedures to the complaint.</p><p>  Where these procedures have been exhausted, that person, if still not satisfied, can make a complaint to IAASA.  If IAASA has reason to believe that the body&rsquo;s Investigation and Disciplinary Procedures have not been complied with, it may initiate an enquiry under the provisions of section 23 of the Act.  Having completed such an enquiry, if IAASA is not satisfied that the body has complied with its approved investigation and disciplinary procedures, IAASA may annul all or part of a decision of that body relating to the matter, direct the body to conduct an investigation or a fresh investigation into the matter or require that body to pay to the Supervisory Authority an amount not exceeding &euro;125,000.</p><p>  Additionally, under Section 24 of the 2003 Act, following a complaint or on its own initiative, where, in its opinion, it is appropriate or in the public interest, IAASA can undertake an investigation into a possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body&rsquo;s standards by a member.  If such a breach is found by IAASA, it may impose any sanction to which the member is liable under the rules of the body and an amount towards the costs incurred by it in investigating and determining the case.  IAASA&rsquo;s functions also include approving and requiring changes to the prescribed accountancy bodies&rsquo; constitution and by-laws, including their investigation and disciplinary procedures and standards, as well as approving any amendments to these.  In addition, my Department is progressing the implementation of a system of external quality assurance in relation to the audits of public interest entities.  Also, work in relation to the adoption of a draft Accounting Directive has progressed significantly at EU level, while work continues there on a draft auditing Directive and Regulation brought forward by the EU Commission in the wake of the financial crisis.</p></reply>

The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages.  It will add value to other Government schemes of support for entrepreneurs, aspiring entrepreneurs and unemployed persons, such as the Back to Work Allowance, the range of training programmes available or the Seed Capital Scheme.  The Fund will provide support in the form of loans of up to &#8364;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.</p><p>  Microfinance Ireland (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, will work closely with the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) / Local Enterprise Offices which provide assistance with training and preparing business plans for entrepreneurs.  They will carry out an initial evaluation of the quality of business proposals/loan applications from entrepreneurs before sending same on to MFI for decision.  Young entrepreneurs can also contact their local County Enterprise Board to discuss what other options may be available to them and their proposed business venture. Contact details for the CEBs can be found on .  CEBs provide both financial and/or non-financial assistance and the introduction of the Microfinance Loan Fund completes the suite of supports they now have to make available to microenterprises and entrepreneurs.  MFI and the CEBs are very conscious of the particular difficulties the youth sector faces with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist young entrepreneurs, they will.  However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.</p></reply>

The annual cost under the contract will be &euro;199,000.  With regard to the interest rate, this will be a commercial matter for the individual participating banks.  As required under EU State Aid rules, a premium will be charged by the State to companies availing of the Scheme and this has been set at 2%.  The design of the scheme was drawn from international experience to support new lending that would not otherwise have been extended by the banks. The consultants who designed the Scheme are Capital for Enterprise Limited who have extensive experience of developing and operating the Small Firms Loan Guarantee and Enterprise Finance Guarantee schemes in the UK.  The design uses a number of core design features of the UK&rsquo;s guarantee scheme for SME lending.</p><p>  However, it is tailored to address the characteristics and market inefficiencies of the Irish SME finance environment.  This has been achieved by consulting, during the design phase, with a number of significant public and private sector bodies and stakeholders with interests in the provision of finance to Irish SMEs.  The 75% guarantee rate is identical to the rate available to Northern Ireland Banks participating in the UK scheme.  For every &euro;150million of additional lending, the Scheme is expected to benefit over 1800 businesses and create over 1,300 jobs.  The cost of the scheme per &euro;150million of lending is &euro;6.38 million.  However this does not take into account benefits to the exchequer this lending will bring in terms of increased tax receipts and decreased social welfare payments.  When these benefits are taken into account, the net gain to the Exchequer is over &euro;25million per &euro;150million of lending, representing a 400% return on the State&rsquo;s investment.</p></reply>

Under the Croke Park Agreement, redeployment generally takes precedence over all other methods of filling a vacancy and supersedes any existing agreements on the deployment of staff.  Redeployment allows staff to be moved from activities which are of lesser priority, or which have been rationalised, reconfigured, or restructured, to areas of greater need. In practical terms these arrangements represent a means of facilitating the targeted reduction in public service numbers in the period 2010 to 2014 while sustaining the on-going delivery of services.</p><p>The full terms of the redeployment scheme and a description of the arrangement are contained in a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular (Circular 8/2010 Redeployment Scheme), issued in July 2010.  Since 27 March 2009 there have been 18 staff redeployed from my Department to other Government Departments and Agencies, and 24 staff redeployed to my Department, on either a temporary or permanent basis, set out as follows in tabular form together with the relevant salary scales.</p><p><table><tr><th>DJEI Redeployments since 27 March 2009</th><th>Grade and Number of Staff</th><th>Salary Scales for General Service Grades</th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Redeployed from DJEI</td><td>Accountant &#8211; 1</td><td>&#8364;65,247 - &#8364;80,814</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Principal Officer &#8211; 1</td><td>&#8364;84,132 - &#8364;103,472</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Assistant Principal &#8211; 2</td><td>&#8364;65,185 - &#8364;80,678</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Higher Executive Officer &#8211; 2</td><td>&#8364;46,081 - &#8364;58,294</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Executive Officer &#8211; 3</td><td>&#8364;30,516 - &#8364;47,975</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Staff Officer &#8211; 1</td><td>&#8364;34,771 - &#8364;46,171</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clerical Officer &#8211; 8</td><td>&#8364;23,177 - &#8364;37,341</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Redeployed to DJEI</td><td>Solicitor &#8211; 1</td><td>&#8364;33,576 - &#8364;80,678</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Principal Officer &#8211; 1</td><td>&#8364;84,132 - &#8364;103,472</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Assistant Principal &#8211; 3</td><td>&#8364;65,185 - &#8364;80,678</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Higher Executive Officer &#8211; 6</td><td>&#8364;46,081 - &#8364;58,294</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Administrative Officer &#8211; 1</td><td>&#8364;33,247 - &#8364;58,294</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Executive Officer &#8211; 2</td><td>&#8364;30,516 - &#8364;47,975</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clerical Officer &#8211; 10</td><td>&#8364;23,177 - &#8364;37,341</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Carer&rsquo;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance. The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other is focused on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Over the next number of months new carer&rsquo;s allowance claims being received in the Department are being processed upon receipt.  Claims which form part of the ring-fenced backlog will be dealt with as quickly as possible in order of date of receipt.</p><p>  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. A noted increase in the number of new claims processed was achieved in September, where claims processed substantially exceeded claim intake, and this increase continues into October.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p></reply>

Many improvements have been introduced in Invalidity Pension Section.  Since June 2011 all Invalidity Pension claims are processed on a new IT platform under the department's service delivery model project.  A comprehensive business process improvement exercise has recently been completed within Invalidity Pension Section, the focus of which is to optimise performance and reduce waiting times.  New processes and structures have been introduced in the area since June 2012.  There is a dedicated team which deals with new invalidity pension claims.  Currently, new claims are processed on receipt.  A separate team is focused on the elimination of the backlog, which has been ring-fenced.  That team is currently processing the final batch of these claims, all of which were received since January 2012 and are currently in receipt of illness benefit.  However, there are some claims still awaiting decision which were received earlier than January 2012.  These claims are awaiting a medical assessment or further information from the claimant.</p><p>  The processing time for individual invalidity pension claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria.  In addition, factors outside the Department's control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.  Since the introduction of these new processes and structures, the number of pending claims has reduced from 7007 to 5372 from end May 2012 &ndash; end of September 2012 &ndash; and continues to reduce.  Processes and procedures are continuously reviewed with the explicit objective of reducing delays and the situation is being closely monitored by my Department.</p></reply>

A claim form has been sent to him. On receipt of the completed claim form, his entitlement to a State pension (contributory) will be fully examined and he will be notified of the outcome without delay.  If an applicant has been insurably employed in Ireland, and also in another EU country or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, legislation provides for an additional comparative examination of their State pension entitlements based on the aggregation of their Irish and foreign social insurance records, and the awarding of the most favourable pension/rate determined. In this case however, it is not possible to take social insurance contributions the person concerned has paid in South Africa into account in assessing his State pension entitlement, as Ireland does not have a bilateral social security agreement with that country.</p></reply>

My Department has been operating within the terms of the Moratorium on Recruitment and Promotions within the Public Service, and the promotions and assignments to higher duties have been effected in accordance with a number of sanctions as authorised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).  All assignments are made taking account of business demands and with the approval of senior management.  The promotions effected during the period March 2009 to October 2012 are listed in tabular form at <i>Appendix 1.  </i>  The Deputy will see that there was a significant turnover in the staffing of senior management levels in my Department, particularly at Management Board, with the Secretary General, three Assistant Secretaries and three Directors retiring during 2010.  These retirements resulted in consequential promotions.</p><p>In addition, under the Programme for Government, the Department has been tasked with the development of a new integrated income support and employment support service, which involved the integration of over 1,700 staff from the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Employment/Community Services from FAS.  The Department put a new regional and divisional management structure in place, to support the new service delivery model and the Department&rsquo;s business support areas.  In this regard, the Department sought and received sanction from DPER for additional promotions as no senior management structure, (officials above AP level), transferred with the 1,000 staff from the HSE.  Initially, eight higher duty allowances allowing staff to perform duties at Principal Officer level were awarded to manage the transfer of the CWS service and the ongoing operations and integration of this business area.  These posts were subsequently assigned on a permanent basis, following a competitive process in early 2012.</p><p>The assignment to higher duties are listed in <i>Appendix 2 </i>  and, apart from the exceptional circumstances above, are generally applied in limited circumstances only, to address issues such as long term staff absences, maternity or carers leave.  Assignments varied in duration, and, as a general rule, were resorted to only in cases where the absence was expected to exceed a minimum period of twelve (12) weeks.  All salary increases were in line with agreed payscales.</p><p><b>Appendix 1</b></p><p><b>Promotions 2009 - 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>YEAR</div></th><th><div>Secretary

The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p><p>  I am informed by the SEAI that the house in question was surveyed for suitability for attic and cavity wall insulation, at which time it was identified as a dormer bungalow.  The practice of insulating dormer roofs through the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was recently reviewed in respect of value for money, the overall effectiveness of the additional insulation which can only be undertaken in part of the roof space, and the significant costs associated with achieving appropriate ventilation in the roof space to avoid condensation problems.  All of this is in the context of endeavouring to address the maximum number of vulnerable fuel poor homes from within available resources.  On balance it has been decided that the significant costs are not generally justified by the marginal insulation gains.  Therefore insulation of dormer roofs is not currently implemented under the scheme.  However, I am advised that SEAI will continue to keep the matter under review with my officials for feasible cost effective alternatives, particularly where the homes are in extreme fuel poverty, at which time affected houses may be revisited.  Separately it was noted during the survey that this home should receive cavity wall insulation.  However, the homeowner has declined this service as they do not wish to have the additional wall vents installed, which are deemed essential for a safe and healthy air quality.</p><p>  I am informed that the SEAI have no record of an email from you to the Oireachtas line as indicated and if you would like to contact them again on this matter they would be happy to answer any further queries you may have.

From the reply, he will see that there has been a significant reduction in the number of people affected.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, we have not and do not propose to introduce grant schemes for digital switchover.  Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and there is increased competition in the market.  There is clear evidence that happened in Ireland with affordable set top boxes that meet the SAORVIEW standard on the market, as well as a range of suitable digital televisions.  In addition, experience from other European countries also shows that the availability of accurate and reliable information and the provision of practical assistance is the most effective approach towards assisting people in making the switch to digital television.</p><p>  In this regard, a substantial information campaign has been delivered which resulted in 99% awareness of digital switch over.   The campaign will run up to the end of 2012.  In conjunction with this, on 10 January 2012, I signed an agreement with a national voluntary organisation, the Wheel, to develop and operate a nationwide community outreach digital switchover programme (Outreach Programme).  This programme has been very successful and will run for a number of weeks after digital switchover on 24<sup>th</sup> October to ensure that assistance continues to be available to any vulnerable households who have not switched over.</p></reply>

The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland contains a commitment to introduce a property tax for 2012.  The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally-delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services wit h the demand for such services. It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a Local Property Tax would take time to introduce and accordingly to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government decided to introduce a Household Charge in 2012 as an interim measure.  This was done via the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011.</p><p>  An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable Local Property Tax to replace the household charge.  The Expert Group&rsquo;s terms of reference were to consider the design of a Local Property Tax to be approved by Government, which is equitable and is informed by previous work and international experience.  The Group submitted its report to me and proposals will be brought to Government as soon as possible.  It would not be appropriate to comment on the content of the Expert Group&rsquo;s report at this point, pending Government&rsquo;s consideration of the report and the associated issues.  It will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the exact details of implementation, including considerations related to the Non Principal Private Residences Charge, taking into account the modalities involved.  The Government has decided that the Local Property Tax will be collected and administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

In this regard, payroll savings have been delivered mainly through staff reductions of almost 8,600 (23%) from 37,243 (June 2008) to 28,652 (September 2012).  The departure of 8,600 staff from the sector since 2008 has inevitably impacted in different ways upon individual local authorities.  My Department and local authorities have prioritised the examination of the present and future workforce demographic in the context of service delivery, organisational diversity, knowledge transfer, up-skilling/re-skilling and succession planning.</p><p>  To support the sector in effectively managing the combination of staff reductions and the reform/change programme a Workforce Study has been undertaken jointly by local authorities and my Department. In particular, the study assesses the management requirements of local authorities bearing in mind the potential impacts of shared services and other reform initiatives underway.  Each local authority is in turn preparing a detailed workforce plan outlining how it will implement the study&rsquo;s recommendations.  The individual local authority work force studies will examine all categories of local authority staff including outdoor staffing requirements. </p></reply>

I am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments (NCC) to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations.  The NCC includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector and real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.  Under the Public Safety Initiative (PSI), my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;3.549 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available to address immediate public safety issues in 2011.  The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.</p><p>  Site Resolution Plans (SRPs) have been identified by the NCC as a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents, to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents.  The NCC has produced a Guidance Manual on Resolving and Managing Unfinished Estates, a Key Stakeholders Code of Practice, and a Guide for Residents Living in Unfinished Housing Developments, all of which are available at www.housing.ie.</p><p>  The first Annual Progress Report of the NCC, published by my Department on 5 July, confirmed that, through the use of the SRP process, 211 estates have been completed and issues are now resolved.  In respect of a further 523 estates, plans are now in place and in many of these cases work has commenced and significant progress will be achieved over the coming months.  I anticipate that this progress will be reflected in the 2012 National Housing Development Survey now underway.  The results of this Survey are expected later this year and will update the position on Site Resolution Plans.   </p></reply>

More generally, legislation relating to sexual offences usually provides for the maximum sentence to be imposed.  In some cases, special provisions apply.  For example, an offence by a person in authority is effectively treated as an aggravating factor in the case of certain sexual offences against children. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the presiding judge to determine the sentence to be imposed in a particular case having heard all the evidence presented, and taking case law, including appeals, into account.  This allows the court to weigh all the circumstances of the offence and all the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.  Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides for the making of a compensation order (on application or otherwise) against a convicted person by the court instead of or in addition to dealing with the person in any other way, unless it sees reason to the contrary.  The Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against a sentence imposed if she believes it to be unduly lenient. </p><p>  The Government is committed to a strategic review of penal policy, including sentencing, and this review is now underway.  In addition, the Law Reform Commission is reviewing the law on mandatory sentences and published a consultation paper in January this year.  The Commission invited submissions on its consultation paper from interested parties and is expected to publish its final report in early 2013.  I will await the outcome of both these reviews and consider the recommendations made before taking any further action regarding the law on sentencing.</p></reply>

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and it took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. </p><p>  In England and Wales, for example, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.  Helpful information notes for hedge owners, complainants and local authorities have been published on the website of Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment. </p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort.  This is designed to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings would leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department. </p><p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed, i.e., whether an easement of light or otherwise, and that there had been a substantial interference with that right. </p><p>  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Under the relevant regulations, fees paid to counsel acting in the Circuit and higher courts for defendants who have been granted free legal aid are paid on a parity basis with the fees payable to prosecution counsel as set by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The fees paid to solicitors for the defendant are related to those paid to junior counsel.  Details of the main fees payable are set out in the table below.  It should be noted that these fees were subject to reductions of 10% from 1 October 2011 as well as reductions of 8% in 2009 and 2010.</p><p>The regulations also provide that any disbursements that are reasonably made for the purposes of a case and are of a reasonable amount are also payable e.g. photocopying costs may be claimed at 11c per page.  This rate was also reduced in 2011.  The travel rate payable to solicitors was reduced with effect from 13 July 2011 to 24c per km and the subsistence rate was reduced by 50%.  There is no entitlement for counsel to claim travel and subsistence under the regulations.</p><p>It should be noted that expenditure on criminal legal aid to 30 September, 2012 was &euro;36.8m which is a 12.5% decrease over the same period last year.</p><p>  <b>SCHEDULE OF MAIN FEES</b>  <b>Senior Counsel </b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Court</div></th><th><div>Brief</div></th><th><div>Refresher</div></th><th><div>Sentence</div></th><th><div>Adjourned Sentence</div></th></tr><tr><td>Circuit Court</td><td><div>&#8364;1,716</div></td><td><div>&#8364;858</div></td><td><div>&#8364;370</div></td><td><div>&#8364;185</div></td></tr><tr><td>Central Criminal Court/Murder</td><td><div>&#8364;7,127</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,562</div></td><td><div>&#8364;370</div></td><td><div>&#8364;185</div></td></tr><tr><td>Central Criminal <br />Court/Rape</td><td><div>&#8364;5,704</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,562</div></td><td><div>&#8364;370</div></td><td><div>&#8364;185</div></td></tr></table></p><p>  <b>Junior Counsel</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Court</div></th><th><div>Brief</div></th><th><div>Refresher</div></th><th><div>Sentence</div></th><th><div>Adjourned Sentence</div></th></tr><tr><td>Circuit Court </td><td><div>&#8364;1,144</div></td><td><div>&#8364;572</div></td><td><div>&#8364;247</div></td><td><div>&#8364;124</div></td></tr><tr><td>Central Criminal Court/Murder</td><td><div>&#8364;4,752</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,041</div></td><td><div>&#8364;247</div></td><td><div>&#8364;124</div></td></tr><tr><td>Central Criminal<br />Court/Rape</td><td><div>&#8364;3,803</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1,041</div></td><td><div>&#8364;247</div></td><td><div>&#8364;124</div></td></tr></table></p><p>  <b>Solicitor</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Court</div></th><th><div>Brief</div></th><th><div>Refresher</div></th><th><div>Sentence</div></th><th><div>Adjourned Sentence</div></th></tr><tr><td>Circuit Court</td><td><div>&#8364;1,144</div></td><td><div>&#8364;418</div></td><td><div>&#8364;180</div></td><td><div>&#8364;90</div></td></tr><tr><td>Central Criminal Court/Murder</td><td><div>&#8364;7,127</div></td><td><div>&#8364;750</div></td><td><div>&#8364;180</div></td><td><div>&#8364;90</div></td></tr><tr><td>Central Criminal<br />Court/Rape</td><td><div>&#8364;3,803</div></td><td><div>&#8364;760</div></td><td><div>&#8364;180</div></td><td><div>&#8364;90</div></td></tr></table></p><p></p></reply>

In accordance with this principle, the traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created important exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  It is important to note that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. </p><p>  As regards seeking consistency in sentencing generally, the Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being actively developed by the judiciary with the help of the Irish Sentencing Information System or &quot;ISIS&quot; which is an initiative of the judiciary and is an electronic system designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines.  For my own part, I would not favour an undue interference in the independence of the judiciary.  The decision on what kind of sentence to impose is a judicial determination and, except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  A point was made in the Commission's report that the more detailed the requirements of any statutory sentencing procedure, the more likely it was that mistakes would arise leaving sentences open to challenge on technical grounds only.  I should add that the Law Reform Commission has been asked to consider and, if appropriate, recommend reforms in the law in relation to mandatory sentencing.  The Commission will consider the use of mandatory sentences for offences in general terms along with approaches based on &quot;ranges of sentences&quot;.  They have published a consultation paper and I look forward to receiving their final recommendations in due course. </p><p>  The Deputy might also be interested to note that the subject of criminal sanctions has been a key component in the White Paper on Crime process which my Department has been engaged in since 2009.  It was addressed specifically  in a consultation seminar held in 2010 and was part of a discussion document and a call for written submissions.  A wide range of detailed submissions was received in response to the discussion document and a report on these submissions, along with a summary of the consultation meeting, was published last year.  These reports are available on my Department's website (www.justice.ie). The input received will feed into the overall White Paper process and will provide a comprehensive framework for future crime policy in the form of a National Anti-Crime strategy.  </p><p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group which published its report last year.  The review will examine all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies and I expect the Group to report by mid 2013.</p></reply>

The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process. On its publication, the discussion document was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The joint committee is conducting the consultation process and has been asked to report back to me by the end of November.  </p><p>  In addition, my Department hosted a conference on 13 October to discuss the consultation paper.

Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<br /><br /><b>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.</b><br /><br /><b>There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;</b><br /><br />The Minister added that:   <b>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.</b><br /><br /><b>My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.</b>   <br /><br /><b>This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.</b>   <br /><br /><b>I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;</b>   <br /><br />The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website,    <br /><br />This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection.

I have, however, set out information below on how my Department has managed its staff numbers since the introduction of the Moratorium on recruitment and promotion which may be of assistance to the Deputy.</p><p>  While continuing to deliver critical services, a wide range of initiatives have been taken to reduce staff numbers including the utilisation of all available exit mechanisms (e.g. retirements, career breaks, shorter working year and redeployment) as well as significant re-organisation of functions within the Department,  achievement of considerable flexibilities at unit level, pro-active management of flexibilities around work sharing and other schemes and non-replacement of all but the most vital of staff who vacate posts.  On that basis my Department has shed some 16% of its serving staff in the period from 2008 to end Q3 2012.</p><p>  Since the introduction of the Moratorium internal promotions, either temporary or permanent, have only arisen in limited circumstances. Such circumstances would have included, limited filling of vital vacant posts, limited replacement of staff availing of the Shorter Working Year Scheme and providing cover to posts where staff have been assigned to EU Presidency duties. I am advised that the necessary sanctions from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were obtained in all cases.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Coroner to decide whether a post mortem should be conducted and to determine the cause of death.</p><p>Lariam is a malaria chemoprophylactic agent first authorised for use in 1989 by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), which is the statutory regulatory body charged with regulating the use of medicines, to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines available in Ireland.  Research has shown that it is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  While certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in Drug Safety Newsletters in 1996 and 2003, the IMB remained of the view that the benefit/risk profile for the product remained acceptable. The IMB continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate. Lariam remains the medication of choice for the Defence Forces for missions to sub-Saharan Africa and continues to be certified by the IMB.</p><p>In accordance with best international practice in prescribing Lariam, and taking account of the contra-indications, warnings and side effects highlighted by the IMB, it is the policy of the Defence Forces to screen all personnel for medical suitability.  The screening system rules out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions for example depression, anxiety, neurodegenerative disorders, etc., which, as has been indicated by the IMB and other regulatory bodies worldwide, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.</p></reply>

A number of other factors must be considered. The choice of chemoprophylaxis medication depends on the risk of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and finally adherence issues.   Doxycycline is licensed for use by the Irish Medicines Board. It has to be taken in the absence of dairy products. It has a daily dosing regime. It can cause minor but troublesome gastrointestinal side effects in some individuals. It can also produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes (akin to severe sun burn) and this is particularly significant when used in sunny climates. For this reason it is not recommended for first line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa. It is the anti-malaria chemoprophylaxis of first choice by the Defence Forces in some geographic regions, for example Afghanistan.</p><p>  By way of clarification, the figure of 27,392 Doxycycline tables referred to, relates to the number of Doxycycline tablets purchased by the Brigade Medical Services since 2006 and not to the number of tablets issued to Defence Forces personnel. As indicated in my written response to an earlier Parliamentary Question on the matter from the Deputy, information is being compiled on   the number of Doxycycline tablets issued and I will forward this collated information to the Deputy when it becomes available.</p></reply>

In addition to this, Ministers will have collective responsibility for decisions on the overall package of measures to be introduced in the context of the upcoming Budget. It would be inappropriate for me at this time to comment on Budgetary matters or to engage in unwarranted speculation before these Budgetary deliberations are concluded. I would emphasise that no decisions have been made by Government at this stage and nor will they until Budgetary deliberations are concluded. In the circumstances I do not think that speculation is helpful and I do not propose to engage in such speculation. </p><p>  In general I am supported by my Department in contributing to the assessment of all proposals that come before Government that have implications for children and young people. I can assure the Deputy that the various dimensions to the well-being of children and young people require my Department to work across Government and with a wide range of stakeholders to promote the physical, emotional and economic well being of children and young people. Building strong collaborative relationships with Government Departments to achieve these aims is a key objective in my Department&rsquo;s Strategy Statement 2011-2014. For example, my Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a &lsquo;whole of Government approach&rsquo; to tackling disadvantage and poverty in the population. The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular. </p><p>  My Department will continue to work in close partnership with the Department of Social Protection and other Government Departments on a range of cross-cutting issues in relation to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people.</p></reply>

These failures can be attributed to a number of factors including systemic issues regarding consistency, quality of service delivery, data management and risk management systems both within and outside of child protection systems.  In response to these failings, I am firmly committed to the transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services, and to the establishment of a new Child and Family Support Agency. I am particularly mindful of the consistent themes emerging in these published reports regarding the need for a significantly improved and better integrated approach to meeting the needs of vulnerable children and families. </p><p>  The final report of the Task Force, which I established to advise on the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency, made recommendations on a number of key issues. I share with the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multidisciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive, less expensive responses which have a preventive function. </p><p>  The new Child and Family Support Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.  The establishment of the Agency, underpinned by legislation, and incorporating key children and family services, will provide a focus for the comprehensive change programme currently being implemented under the leadership of Gordon Jeyes, National Director of Child and Family Services and CEO designate for the new Agency.  The change programme is designed to significantly enhance the level and consistency of child welfare and protection services.  This change process will continue into the new Child and Family Support Agency.  </p><p>  The necessary legislation to establish the Agency is being prepared by my Department as a priority. It is anticipated that the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this session, and it is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families from the start of January 2013.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing in my Department to put the relevant elements of <i>Children First </i>on a statutory footing.  The Deputy will be aware that <i>Children First </i>has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999. Significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of <i>Children First</i> and in the case of the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, <i>Children First</i> has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices. The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of <i>Children First</i>   throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector.</p><p>  Under Children First, organisations are required to appoint a Designated Officer. The Designated Officer has responsibility that staff and volunteers are vetted, recruited properly and are trained in safe practices with children and in recognising signs of abuse and neglect. The Designated Officer makes information available to parents about child protection in the organisation and will have a system in place to check and report on its compliance with the legislation. In the legislation, it is proposed that the Designated Officer along with certain named professionals will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse to the HSE. The obligation to report abuse extends to abuse and neglect wherever it occurs, that comes to the attention of the Designated Officer in the course of his / her work or volunteer activities. </p><p>  To assist Designated Officers and certain named professionals make a determination as to whether to report abuse, a &#8216;Guidance for Reporting of Abuse&#8217; is to be developed by my Department. This Guidance will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate routes for the reporting of abuse. The Guidance will assist designated officers and professionals named in the legislation, in their considering a number of factors to see if the concern reaches the threshold of a report under the legislation. This approach is intended to ensure that only those cases which require an assessment by the HSE are brought to its attention.  In the context of the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency, a Regulatory Impact Analysis will accompany the preparation of relevant legislation and the allocation of resources will be considered.</p><p>  Further, the use of different systems of child abuse management, a legacy issue from the previous Health Boards, is being addressed in the context of the Reform Programme in the HSE with a single, national, service delivery model in development, and through the introduction of a National Child Care Information System (NCCIS).  The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services. As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service. Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system. In this regard, a national standardised business process has been implemented in each Integrated Service Area to ensure that data and systems are unified. The introduction of the NCCIS is a high priority and will help in the management of social work case management and will significantly improve the level, quality and accessibility of information in respect of Children and Family Services.</p></reply>

In the area of children and family services this suite of indicators has recently been expanded to include new indicators aimed at capturing the responsiveness of services to referrals of concerns. These indicators include details of the number of referrals to child welfare and protection teams in the reporting period, the  number of such referrals where a preliminary assessment took place within 24 hours, the number leading to initial assessments and the number of such assessments completed within 21 days.</p><p>  These new performance indicators are being introduced in the context of the ongoing standardisation of business processes in the Children and Family Services of the HSE, the Reform Programme in the HSE with a single, national, service delivery model in development, and the introduction of a National Child Care Information System (NCCIS).  The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services.

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First and the Heads of the Bill have been prepared and submitted to the Committee for Health and Children for their consideration.</p><p>  I am aware that the proposed legislation could give rise to a significant number of reports being made to the HSE and I am cognisant of the need for an effective filtering system to be put in place. In this regard, &lsquo;Guidance for Reporting of Abuse&rsquo;  is to be developed by my Department. This Guidance will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate routes for the reporting of abuse. The Guidance will be dependent on designated officers and professionals named in the legislation, considering a number of factors to see if the concern reaches the threshold of a report under the legislation. </p><p>  It is important to note that Mr. Gordon Jeyes, HSE National Director Children and Family Services has given me an assurance that all referrals when initially received are assessed and the action taken is prioritised by risk.  In addition, the new Child and Family Support Agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services is to be established. A new model to deal effectively with referrals  is being developed to ensure that all child welfare and protection reports receive a service promptly from the range of family support services and child protection services available.</p></reply>

Key to the delivery of this policy is ensuring that society in general is aware of the possibility of abuse and neglect of children and of the reporting procedures available where concerns are identified. </p><p>  Child abuse takes place in a variety of settings. International research shows that most child neglect and physical abuse takes place in the home. Abuse also takes place in other settings e.g. school, recreational etc.  The Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children document was designed to assist in identifying and reporting child abuse. The guidelines specifically highlight the roles and responsibilities of the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the two agencies with statutory responsibility for child protection. The Guidelines are also intended to assist organisations in ensuring that children under their care are safe, that staff / volunteers can identify possible abuse within the organisation or elsewhere and that there is in place the appropriate structure for reporting to relevant statutory bodies.</p><p>  To ensure that <i>Children First</i>   is properly implemented across Government Departments and at sectorial level the DCYA has established a Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group (CFIDG). Part of the role CFIDG is to report on sectorial issues and/or challenges arising from the implementation of the Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children and to share information on good practice to ensure the successful implementation of Children First nationwide.  The Deputy will be aware that <i>Children First </i>has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999.

An unacceptably high proportion of children have been the subject of some form of bullying, and we know that there have in some cases been tragic consequences.</p><p><b>Bullying in Schools</b></p><p>  The <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>   identifies that bullying in schools is a particular problem and offers some guidance on the issue. It highlights the need for school management boards to have a policy in place to deal with bullying, and to ensure that teachers are aware of this policy and of procedural guidelines to deal with it. </p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills deals with regulations and guidelines on the issue of bullying in schools. It is my understanding that the individual Board of Management of the school is the body responsible for the governance of the school, including responsibility for implementing effective policies to counter bullying. Any complaint of bullying should in the first instance be made to the Chairperson of the Board of Management. The Department of Education and Skills may subsequently become involved should it be necessary to review the handling of the complaint by the Board of Management. </p><p><b>Cyber Bullying</b></p><p>  We are all aware that children and young people are very susceptible to the use of electronic media for bullying purposes, as use of this media, particularly for social networking, continues to grow. Research findings from the Anti-Bullying Centre in Trinity College recently indicated that one in four girls and one in six boys in Ireland have been involved in cyberbullying either as a victim, bully or both.</p><p>  The Office for Internet Safety was established by the Government to take a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. It was instrumental in publishing &#8216;A Guide to Cyber Bullying&#8217; at the end of 2008. The Office advises never to have a personal conversation with a stranger, whether it&#8217;s by email, a chatroom, a social networking website or instant messenger. The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) developed the website 'www.webwise.ie'   which provides information and resources to teachers, parents and students to help ensure that children&#8217;s online experiences are positive and safe.</p><p>  The ISPCC urges parents of children who spend a lot of unsupervised time on the internet to become better informed about online safety and to communicate with their children around the rules and boundaries of internet usage. It is worrying that many secondary aged children do not use any privacy settings on their social network profile; clearly indicating that many young people are not taking necessary and available steps to ensure their information is kept private. Internet usage, also possible now on many portable devices, is set to become even more popular, so vigilance is required. In order to combat bullying simple steps can be taken such as saving the evidence, telling a parent, and crucially not responding to the bullying behaviour.  I intend ensuring that responses to cyberbullying will be further prioritised in the new Children &amp; Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework being prepared by my Department. </p><p><b>Homophobia</b></p><p>  My Department provided funding in 2010 towards &#8220;Addressing Homophobia - Guidelines for the Youth Sector In Ireland&#8221;, developed by the BeLonG To Youth Services. This is an important resource to help raise awareness of homophobia and to support the youth sector in preventing and addressing homophobic bullying.</p><p><b>Serious Bullying considered to be Abuse</b></p><p>  Serious instances of bullying behaviour, whether by other children or by adults should be reported to the HSE Children and Family Services and/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with the procedures outlined in the <i>Children First </i>  Guidance.</p></reply>

Particular regard is had to the needs of young people between the ages of 10 and 21, and to those who are socially or economically disadvantaged including early school-leavers, homeless youth and those who are unemployed or at risk of substance misuse.</p><p>   In particular, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides targeted supports to disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2) and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  Universal supports are also made available to all young people via the Youth Service Grant Scheme, Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &ndash; The Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award.  These measures are providing positive developmental opportunities for young people, enhancing their personal and social competencies, increasing social inclusion and social integration and improving school attendance and engagement in the formal education process. Funding of some &euro;56.806m for current expenditure is available from my Department in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes.</p><p>  Some 1,400 staff employed under these schemes are funded by my Department in addition to 24.5 (WTE) Youth Officer posts in VECs throughout the country.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am committed to the development of a new youth policy framework which my Department is currently progressing. One of my key aims for youth policy development will be to ensure optimum use of all the financial and human resources available. Accordingly, the development of my Department&rsquo;s policy in relation to young people will focus specifically on ensuring greater coherence, coordination and impact in youth policy and provision across Departments and services so as to ensure quality outcomes for all.</p></reply>

There are currently two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits, and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to themselves and their dependents without undue hardship.  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of "undue hardship" where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances. </p></reply>

Under this  facility, prescriptions for certain drugs and medicines may be renewed on a three monthly, rather than a monthly, basis.  Patients who are stabilized on their medication do not need to visit their General Practitioner (GP) every month in order to have their prescriptions renewed.  The facility to change prescriptions from monthly to quarterly for suitable patients provides efficiencies for GPs and patients, by reducing unnecessary consultations and journeys to the surgery and pharmacy. </p></reply>

Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, pseudoephedrine is listed as a prescription medicine which may, in  limited circumstances, be supplied without a prescription.   It may only be supplied without a prescription from a pharmacy, by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist.  In addition, it may only be supplied if the maximum daily dose that a patient would consume is less than 240mg per day in the case of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride products and 180mg per day in the case of pseudoephedrine sulfate products.  The maximum dose of pseudoephedrine products which may be supplied without a prescription is 60 mg.</p><p>  Irish medicines legislation does not currently limit the pack size of pseudoephedrine which may be supplied to a person without prescription.   There is a range of pack sizes available covering solid dosage forms and liquid formulations. The maximum size authorised on the Irish market for over the counter sale is 32 tablets of 30mg pseudoephedrine/tablet (or 960mg total quantity per pack).  Regarding the liquid preparations the maximum authorised pack size in Ireland is 200mls which contains a total quantity of 450mg pseudoephedrine per pack.</p><p>  Pseudoephedrine products are useful and effective medicines for the treatment of symptoms of cold and flu or sinusitis. Restriction of pseudoephedrine to prescription control would require patients to visit a doctor for management of self-treatable conditions, placing additional financial burdens on patients and increased demand for GP services.</p><p>  In recognition of the concern that pseudoephedrine can be  used in the illicit manufacture of methylamphetamine (commonly known as &ldquo;methamphetamine&rdquo;, &ldquo;crystal meth&rdquo; or &ldquo;ice&rdquo;), professional guidance was issued by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) to pharmacists in relation to sales of pseudoephedrine-containing products in September 2012. PSI guidelines to pharmacists recommend that the pharmacist should identify an appropriate and secure location in the pharmacy to store pseudoephedrine products, that requests for these products should be referred to the pharmacist personally and that pharmacists should use their professional judgment and discretion in deciding whether a genuine clinical need exists for the medicine and that the medicine is appropriate for the patient. Community pharmacists exercise professional judgment and can refuse to supply pseudoephedrine-containing products if deemed necessary.</p><p>  The benefits and risks of all medicines are assessed by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) on an ongoing basis, with changes to the product information and new recommendations/restrictions applied as appropriate, on the basis of new and emerging safety information.  The situation regarding pseudoephedrine is being monitored closely by the Department, IMB, PSI and the other relevant agencies.</p></reply>

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:</p><p>  -	Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training (RT);</p><p>  -	Health-funded day services;</p><p>  -	F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;</p><p>  -	Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.</p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, almost 700 school-leavers required RT places or day services and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner so as to be as responsive as possible to the needs of this cohort. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services or RT places to school-leavers with special needs, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school-leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.</p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions', proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.</p></reply>
