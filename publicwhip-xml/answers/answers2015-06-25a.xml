    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-25a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062500045#WRA00500"><p>The background to the deployment of a Naval Service vessel to Skellig Michael last year arose from the establishment, by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, of a three day maritime exclusion zone around the site in accordance with the Marine Safety Act 2005.  I understand that this exclusion zone was placed at the request of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in order to mitigate against the potential risk to the island habitat from unauthorised coastal activity, landings and/or intrusions. In this context the Department of Defence was contacted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht seeking support from the Naval Service and my Department agreed that a Naval Service vessel, acting in an Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role, would be deployed.   </p>  <p>  The vessel in question, the LE Samuel Beckett, was on scheduled sailing orders during this period. When on sailing orders, Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in that they are engaged in a range of activities, primarily involving fishery protection duties but also undertaking general maritime surveillance. Accordingly, as L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was on scheduled sailing orders, no additional costs were incurred by the Naval Service in respect of this tasking and accordingly no financial contribution was sought by my Department from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.   </p>  <p>  Whilst the Air Corps was not deployed as part of this operation, they did carry out one reconnaissance helicopter flight to Skellig Michael at the request of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p>  <p>  I understand that filming on Skellig Michael was a considerable boost to local businesses, with in the region of &euro;2 million being spent locally. The film employed 50 Irish crew and utilised a wide range of local service providers, including hotels and restaurants in the Cahirciveen region of west Kerry. I understand that Tourism Ireland are already receiving trade enquires from Tour Operators about opportunities to build itineraries around Star War locations in Ireland. I believe that the potential tourism value from this for Ireland ,   particularly given the proximity of the Wild Atlantic Way , is significant   and   I understand that Tourism Ireland is planning a campaign to convert the interest in Skellig Michael from the film&rsquo;s fans into increased visitors to Ireland in 2016 and beyond.</p></reply>

On foot of this Government decision, Kildare County Council prepared a local area plan for the site which encompassed a range of uses including community use. Following discussions at that time between the Department, Kildare County Council and the then Department of Environment, Heritage &amp;amp; Local Government, it was agreed that the entire site would be transferred to Kildare County Council in accordance with the terms of the Housing Initiative.    However, in 2009  the local authority contacted the Department to state that it no longer wished to take possession of the property. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Local Development Plan for Kildare Town 2012-2018 has made provision for substantial community developments on the barracks site. Consequently, any buyer will be obliged to comply with these provisions. This will ensure that the local community will benefit directly from the sale.    </p>  <p>  It is my view that the obligation to community development was met by the offer to transfer the full site to Kildare County Council and the subsequent Local Development Plan which makes provision for community developments on the site.   </p>  <p>  Also, eight acres on the Barrack site is currently being developed for local schools. Officials from my Department recently met with the CEO from Kildare County Council. Discussions included the Department&rsquo;s intention to dispose of the remaining c. 54 acres of the site by public auction later this year. In the interim, the Department remains open to proposals from the Council, subject to achieving a satisfactory return for the property.</p></reply>

This approach is in line with the 2000 White Paper on Defence and the Government decision of February 2000 which approved the allocation of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to military requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. The allocation of monies from property disposals to the Department ceased over the last number of years, with the downturn in the economy. However, approval has recently been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for 50% of actual sale receipts to be provided to the Department in the estimate for Capital expenditure.  This arrangement will commence with 50% of actual 2015 sale receipts provided in the 2016 estimate for Capital expenditure.    Some of the major re-equipment programmes over the years include the acquisition of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles, Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers, two EC 135 helicopters, six AW 139 helicopters and two new Offshore Patrol vessels. </p></reply>

The mission is one element of a comprehensive approach to addressing the migration crisis in the South Central Mediterranean.  The Mission will be implemented in sequential phases and the first phase of the operation, to support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law, will commence shortly. To move beyond the first phase the Council will assess whether the conditions for transition have been met, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and the consent of the coastal States concerned. The second phase involves the targeting, seizure and possible destruction of the vessels and assets of human traffickers. The third phase is an operational/disruption phase. </p>  <p>  Consideration of participation by the Irish Defence Forces in EU NAVFOR Med will only occur if there is a UN Security Council Resolution and the applicable National statutory requirements are met. I understand that discussions on a draft Security Council Resolution are ongoing.   </p>  <p>  In the meantime I can assure the Deputy that no members of the Defence Forces have conducted operations in Libyan territory. This includes Libyan Territorial Waters.   </p></reply>

Eithne arrived in the South Central Mediterranean on 23 May 2015, to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean.  The role of the Irish Naval vessel is to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean. Assistance to persons in distress at sea is being provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations. Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance is being achieved by close co-operation with the Italian authorities. </p>  <p>  L.&Eacute;. Eithne is deployed on the high seas in international waters between Sicily and Libya, which is where most migrant activity and search and rescue incidents have occurred. To date, L.&Eacute;. Eithne has been involved in 14 rescue operations resulting in the rescue of circa 2,136 migrants. </p>  <p>  Following their rescue, once on board the Irish Naval Vessel, migrants are provided with medical assistance, food, water and dry clothes to those in need. The migrants are then either transported to a port in Italy, or transferred to another international naval vessel, as directed by the Italian authorities. </p>  <p>I would like to take this opportunity in the House to commend the Naval Service for the outstanding work they are undertaking in the Mediterranean.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that the Society has made substantial improvements to its governance framework in recent years which comply with the standards set by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and also with the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts report which was published in 2012. All of the recommendations made were carefully examined and noted by my Department and the reforms introduced by the Society were substantially facilitated by the legislative amendments made by this Government in 2012. This legislative change represented the most wide ranging and fundamental set of changes to have occurred since the establishment of the Society in 1939. In this regard, I can also confirm that the recommendations made in the Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s report were implemented by the Society in 2012.  Furthermore, in accordance with a Programme for Government commitment, my Department is continuing to progress a legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Irish Red Cross. In this regard, it is proposed that the existing primary legislation which dates back to 1938 is to be repealed in new primary legislation that will redefine the relationship between Government and the Irish Red Cross Society. This will further underpin the independence of the Society. Draft Heads of the Red Cross Bill are currently being finalised.</p></reply>

It is a grave threat to any military force operating in the area.     </p>  <p>  In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces, including the use of Lariam, is working.   </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, formerly the Irish Medicines Board, is the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland. The Defence Forces policy on the use of anti-malarial medication is in line with current HPRA approved summary of product characteristics (SmPC). </p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that the allegation of a link between Lariam and suicide/ suicide ideation has been examined. Of 156 non-service related deaths among members of the Defence Forces in the period January 2000 to December 2010, 25 were apparently from self-inflicted injuries, although only one is recorded by a coroner as &ldquo;suicide&rdquo;.  Of these 25 deaths, 16 had never been prescribed Lariam. Of the remaining 9, given the limited period of time during which Lariam remains in the bloodstream, according to our expert advice, it is extremely unlikely that Lariam could have been a contributory factor in practically all of these cases. There is no evidence in any of the coroners&rsquo; inquests linking any deaths to Lariam.   </p>  <p>  The death rate in the Defence Forces from self-inflicted injuries in the period 2000 to 2010, when Lariam was being prescribed, was 0.24%. The death rate from self-inflicted injuries in the period 1989 &ndash; to 1999, when Lariam was not being prescribed, was 0.32% which is higher than the death rate in the period when Lariam was being prescribed.   </p>  <p>Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam is licensed by the HPRA and must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

Assistance to persons in distress at sea is being provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations. Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance is being achieved by close co-operation with the Italian authorities. </p>  <p>  L.&Eacute;. Eithne is deployed on the high seas in international waters between Sicily and Libya, which is where most migrant activity and search and rescue incidents have occurred. To date, L.&Eacute;. Eithne has been involved in 14 rescue operations resulting in the rescue of circa 2,136 migrants. </p>  <p>  Following their rescue, once on board the Irish Naval Vessel, migrants are provided with medical assistance, food, water and dry clothes to those in need. The migrants are then either transported to a port in Italy, or transferred to another international naval vessel, as directed by the Italian authorities. </p>  <p>  Our focus will remain on continuing to assist the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operation efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.</p></reply>

This case was the subject of a resolution adopted by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 10 March 2010.

The mission is just one element of the comprehensive approach to addressing the migration crisis in the South Central Mediterranean.  Irish Defence Forces Personnel are not taking any part in this mission.   </p>  <p>  The Mission will be implemented in sequential phases and the first phase of the operation, to support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law, will commence shortly. To move beyond the first phase the Council will assess whether the conditions for transition have been met, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and the consent of the coastal States concerned. The second phase involves the targeting, seizure and possible destruction of the vessels and assets of human traffickers. The third phase is an operational/disruption phase. </p>  <p>  Consideration of participation by the Irish Defence Forces in EU NAVFOR Med will only occur if there is a UN Security Council Resolution and the applicable National statutory requirements are met. I understand that discussions on a draft Security Council Resolution are ongoing. </p>  <p>  In the meantime Ireland, through its deployment of the L&Eacute; EITHNE, will continue to assist the Italian authorities on a bilateral basis in the humanitarian search and rescue operation efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.</p></reply>

These included current issues. It also included important issues for the UN such as gender based violence.  I briefed the Secretary General on progress in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s initiative to support peacekeeper training in a number of partner African countries under the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership.</p>  <p>  While in the Curragh, the UN Secretary-General also paid a visit to the United Nations Training School Ireland (UNTSI). The centre draws on the wide range of experience gained by Irish peacekeeping soldiers on many missions world-wide. UNTSI hosts a number of programmes which are also open to international students and to date some fifty-six countries, representing all continents, have attended courses at the centre.   </p>  <p>  Prior to his departure from the Defence Forces Training Centre, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon planted a tree to mark the 60th Anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the United Nations.</p></reply>

There are two existing 1916 commemoration events which have significant Department of Defence and Defence Forces involvement annually. These are the 1916 Commemoration ceremonies that takes place at the GPO every Easter Sunday and at Arbour Hill in early May each year.</p>  <p>  Following the launch by the Taoiseach and Minister Humphreys of the programme of events for Easter 2016, my Department is engaged in ongoing discussions in relation to the involvement of the Defence Forces in the various events planned. It has already been decided that the Commemoration at the GPO on Easter Sunday 2016 will be followed by a parade that will include significant military input. There will also be military participation in wreath laying ceremonies at Kilmainham Gaol and at Glasnevin Cemetery on Easter Sunday.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the Arbour Hill 1916 Commemoration will be held on Sunday 24 April, the centenary day of the 1916 Rising.  The Commemoration will take the form of Requiem Mass for all those who died in the 1916 Rising. It will be followed by a graveside ceremony, including inter-faith prayers, in the adjoining cemetery where 14 of the leaders of the Rising are buried.</p>  <p>  A wide range of other State events are being organised to mark the centenary and many will involve participation by the Defence Forces. Planning for these events has commenced and the first of these will take place this year on 1 August next when the centenary of the funeral of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa will be marked with a State ceremony at Glasnevin Cemetery.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Defence Forces will play a part in a comprehensive programme of events relating to the National Flag, including flag raising ceremonies in Dublin and elsewhere. In this regard, it is planned that all primary schools in the State will be presented with a National Flag and a copy of the proclamation by a member of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will play a very central and important role in the Commemoration events that will take place over the coming 12 months and personnel from all over the country will be drawn to fulfill these commitments.</p></reply>

The current strength figure is 909 personnel.  The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at or close to 9,500 personnel. To this end, targeted general service recruitment will continue.  On average per month, operational duties in the Dublin area account for 206 man-days provided by staff permanently based in Custume Barracks. As the duties normally require the conduct of wide-ranging familiarisation patrols throughout the greater Dublin area, the execution of such duties has the advantage of providing the units involved with improved security situational awareness of the capital.</p></reply>

In the first 5 months of this year, the Department made payments of &euro;8.25 million to almost 3,600 employers in respect of 4,900 employees.  Two levels of payment are provided - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years &ndash; provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.  </p>  <p>  Since 2015, the scheme has been expanded to include those transitioning into employment from the one-parent family payment scheme, and short-term unemployed young people under the Youth Guarantee.  </p>  <p>  A review of the pilot phase of JobsPlus, covering the first year of its operation (from July 2013 to June 2014), confirmed that the aim of putting in place an easily identifiable and user-friendly scheme targeted at employers had been achieved.  It also found that over 60% of jobseekers, more than 24 months on the live register, have benefitted from the initiative, contrary to expectations prior to the introduction of the initiative.  The review noted that the average level of subsidy paid at the end of June 2014 amounted to just under &euro;374 per employee per month and that the net benefit to the Exchequer from each employee maintained in employment was in excess of &euro;11,750 per annum.</p>  <p>  While the risk of distortion may occur in recruitment practices by employers, I am satisfied that JobsPlus has been useful in influencing employers to consider longer-term jobseekers over those more recently unemployed or moving employment.  In line with commitments made in the context of Pathways to Work, the Department recently looked at the first 18 months of operations of JobsPlus.  This confirmed that the findings from the earlier review remain valid.  I propose to publish the outcome of the reviews in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p><p>However, many services are available to people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status.</p><p>With specific reference to upskilling opportunities, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments are eligible to avail of such opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses).  Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation. </p><p>Additionally, an unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.</p><p>Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme. </p><p>Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, although they will not receive any payment. Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. </p><p>The <i>Pathways to Work </i>2015 strategy includes a commitment to develop and evaluate actions to extend services to people not on the Live Register and improve the promotion/communication of existing activation options.  This will be considered in the light of the developing labour market and budgetary context. </p><p>In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p></reply>

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks, with a specific focus on Private Dwelling House (PDH) customers. </p><p>The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for Standard Variable Rates (SVRs) customers in respect of PDH.  Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. </p><p>The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. </p><p>In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks.  This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. </p><p>While no commitment was received in relation to BTLs, it is accepted that additional competition will have the effect of reducing prices to consumers on all products, including mortgage interest rates for Principal Dwelling Houses and Buy-to-Let mortgages.  For example, lower rates are available for many standard variable mortgage customers if they switch lender.  The banks must be convinced that they are at risk of losing customers if they persist with SVRs that are higher than the rate their customers could get elsewhere.  People who are in a position to move their business to another bank should look into their options to do so.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website at has useful information on comparing bank products and I understand that the CCPC is planning to provide better information to encourage mortgage switching.  I fully accept that this is not an option for everyone but I would encourage people to take the time to explore it. </p><p>The Government made a commitment in the Statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016 to applying downward pressure on mortgage rates by increasing and supporting competition in the market and it will continue to work to fulfil that commitment. </p><p>Officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks and a follow up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget. </p></reply>

Therefore final remuneration is a key concept in determining the benefits an individual becomes entitled to on retirement.  The rules of the pension scheme of which the individual is a member would define the remuneration on which her pension benefits will be calculated and whether or not this lump sum can be included in computing her pension entitlements.  All pension benefits are calculated in accordance with the rules of the particular scheme.</p>  <p>  In order to establish whether or not the payment in question is reckonable for pension purposes the individual concerned should contact the administrator of the pension scheme of which she is a member.</p></reply>

The rate of capital gains tax is currently 33%.</p><p>When agricultural land is acquired under a CPO, the acquiring authorities usually pay a premium over the agricultural value.  The premium may cover the tax due on the disposal and the farmer may well have received the agricultural value of the land in his or her net proceeds after disposal.  This means farmers are generally able to buy agricultural land of equivalent value to the land acquired under the CPO.</p><p>In my Budget 2014 speech I announced that an Agri-Taxation Review would be undertaken.  The review has been carried out and the report of the Review was published in the context of Budget 2015 in October last year.  The Review bore Food Harvest 2020, among other things, in mind. It sets out a strategy for agri-taxation policy for the future and concluded that the three main policy objectives are:</p><p>- To increase the mobility and the productive use of land</p><p>- To assist succession</p><p>- To complement wider agriculture policies and schemes, such as supporting environmental sustainability</p><p>The Review made policy recommendations taking into consideration the cost of the existing agri-taxation measures that were already in existence and the need to protect the position of the public finances.  Many of the recommendations made were introduced by way of the last Budget and Finance Bill process including amendments to income tax land leasing reliefs and CGT retirement relief.  However, the Review did not recommend change to the tax treatment of land disposed under a CPO.</p><p>The Review may be of interest to the Deputy and is available at the following link: </p><p>CGT retirement relief is available, among other conditions, in respect of land which has been owned and used for the purposes of farming by the individual disposing of the land for a minimum period of 10 years prior to being disposed of.  In order to qualify for the relief, the individual must be aged 55 or over.  In addition, retirement relief is available in respect of land which has been let by the individual disposing of that land in the period of 5 years prior to the disposal where, immediately before the time the land was first let in that 5-year period, the land was owned and used for the purposes of farming by the individual concerned for a minimum period of 10 years and the disposal is to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers (for example, a local authority) where the disposal is made:</p><p>- for the purposes of enabling the authority to construct, widen or extend a road or part of a road, or</p><p>- for a purpose connected with or ancillary to the construction, widening or extension of a road or part of a road by the authority.</p><p>I note the Deputy s concerns as set out in the particular example in the details supplied with the question.  However, for the reasons I have outlined above, I have no plans to alter the tax treatment of land disposed under CPO.</p></reply>

Tax legislation provides that an employer contribution to a PRSA is treated for tax relief purposes as a contribution made by the employee. However, provided the aggregate amounts of employer and employee contributions to a PRSA do not exceed the annual tax-relieved limits, no effective BIK tax charge arises. It is only where the combined employer/employee contributions exceed the relevant limits that a BIK tax charge will arise. Moreover, any employer contributions to a PRSA which would not qualify for tax relief in one year because of the operation of the tax-relieved limits may be carried forward and treated as a PRSA contribution made by the employee in the following year subject to the age-related percentage limits.  </p></reply>

Further information is available on the Programme website . </p><p>  In brief, the CFRAM Programme has three principal milestones: preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (Completed 2011); predictive Flood Mapping (for finalisation 2015); and flood Risk Management Plans (for finalisation 2016).  Draft predictive flood mapping has been produced and public consultation days have been held in the various communities. The draft maps are currently available for inspection on the individual study websites via and members of the public may provide feedback on same.  The draft flood maps are for the purpose of consultation only and should not be used for any other purpose or decision making process. They are likely to be updated, refined or changed before finalisation. A national statutory consultation is due to be held later this summer.  All feedback received during the draft flood maps consultation period will form part of the process of finalisation of the flood maps. </p><p>Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the assessment of appropriate flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for future State investment in flood defences. </p><p>Total expenditure on the CFRAM Programme over the period 2005 to date is &euro;33 million covering the pilot studies, aerial and topographical surveying, the current ongoing engineering studies and other related expenses.</p><p>The Office of Public Works has no role or function in relation to oversight or regulation of the insurance industry.  Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they are prepared to accept on a case by case basis.  Since June 2014, the OPW has provided Insurance Ireland with data on sixteen completed OPW flood defence schemes in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between  the OPW and Insurance Ireland.  Insurance Ireland members take this data into account when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.  When finalised, the CFRAM predictive flood maps and flood risk management plans will be publicly available.  </p></reply>

One of the measures introduced in the recent CFP is the requirement for each Member State to implement a multi-annual national strategic plan for aquaculture. Ireland&rsquo;s draft <i>National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development</i>along with its accompanying environmental reports is currently undergoing public consultation until 24 July.  The targets for production growth set out in the draft National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development are derived from previously achieved output levels for the key species involved; on that basis it may be said that they are essentially reasonable. The Irish aquaculture sector provided employment for some 1,833 persons and generated output with a first sale value of &euro;115 million in 2014.

In cases where the total payment due to a farmer was less than &euro;100 in any one year, such payment did not issue.  As a consequence, the person named did not receive a direct payment in 2013 and does not hold an automatic right to receive entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015.  However, although he did hold entitlements, up to recently, he has not been considered as eligible to receive entitlements under the provision known as the Scottish Derogation. </p>  <p>  The provision known as the Scottish Derogation allows for the allocation of entitlements to persons who never held Single Payment entitlements but who actively farmed during the 2013 scheme year and can provide verifiable evidence of agricultural production.  Such allocation is restricted to those who &lsquo;produced, reared or grew agricultural products&rsquo; in 2013 in the following sectors beef, dairy, sheep and arable sectors. </p>  <p>   I brought this anomaly to the attention of the EU Commission and it was recently agreed that persons who were entitled to receive a payment of less than &euro;100 in 2013 may be considered as fulfilling the same conditions as farmers who fall within the scope of the Scottish Derogation.  This is subject to the condition that these farmers must never have held payment entitlements, either owned or leased, with a value greater than &euro;100 in any year of the Single Payment Scheme. My Department will be in contact with the person named in the next couple of days to arrange the submission of a Scottish Derogation application.</p></reply>

No 77 of 2009 European Communities (Identification of Bovines) Regulations.  Under these regulations, herd keepers are required to record all births and movements/disposals in the Herd Register of Bovine Animals known as the &lsquo;blue book&rsquo;. The Department has simplified the process of maintaining cattle records for herd keepers using the electronic register Agfood.ie. by removing the requirement to maintain the paper on farm bovine herd register.  Keepers that wish to avail of this facility must complete a declaration agreeing to abide by the Terms and Conditions. Such farmers are required to ensure the information on the electronic register reflects the activity in their herd and is accurate. If information is not maintained by the farmer, it will still constitute a penalty at inspection if the on-farm position is not accurately reflected in AIM.   </p>  <p>  In relation to farm inspections, EU Regulations governing the Direct Payment Schemes and other area-based schemes require my Department to carry out on-the spot checks to ensure compliance with Cross Compliance requirements as laid down in this legislation. Compliance with bovine identification and registration requirements is one of the specific Statutory Management Requirements under the Cross Compliance regime. Where non-compliances with these requirements are identified by means of an on-the-spot check, or where a non-compliance is brought to the attention of my Department, a penalty must be applied. However, where a non-compliance is deemed to be minor in nature, a tolerance may be applied resulting in no financial sanction and the applicant is advised to remedy the problem. Where the non-compliance is not remedied within a certain period, a penalty must be applied.   </p>  <p>  The electronic register initiative facilitates the optimum use of the Department's records to reduce the burden of record keeping for farmers and other stakeholders and confers significant benefits for stakeholders including reduced bureaucracy, removal of duplication, increased flexibility and reduced risk associated with financial penalties arising at cross compliance inspections. </p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas including the lead organisation for each mission are listed in the tabular statement attached.  The decision by Government to send troops overseas is never taken lightly. The safety of all Irish Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions is always a concern to me, my Government colleagues and to the military authorities. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of mission specific training. Such training, which is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of increased threat, has been designed to allow Defence Forces personnel to carry out their tasks and to provide for their protection.</p><p>Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment to carry out their mission. This equipment enables troops to fulfil the roles assigned to them, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission. In addition to training and equipment, ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and both equipment and force assets are continually reviewed to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles.</p><p>The reality is that no peacekeeping mission is without danger. I am confident, however that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel currently serving overseas.</p><p>I am satisfied that the numbers serving within the Defence Forces overseas is of sufficient strength to ensure their viability at all times.</p><p><b><i>MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE SERVING OVERSEAS AS OF 01 JUNE 2015</i></b><table><tr><th>1.</th><th>UN MISSIONS</th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNIFIL 49th Infantry Group</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNIFIL Sector West HQ</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel and Syria </td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNDOF (United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) HQ, Golan Heights Syria</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UNDOF 48th Infantry Group</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>357</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EUFOR (EU led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EUTM Mali (EU led Training Mission)</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RSM (Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan)</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS</td><td>392</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>OTHER DEPLOYMENTS</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UK EBOLA TREATMENT CENTRE (Sierra Leone)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Naval Service Humanitarian Mission in Mediterranean (L.&Eacute;.

This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time.  The total receipts from disposal of installations and lands from 1998 to date amount to approx &euro;108 million.</p>  <p>  To date the sale has been completed on nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Rockhill (Letterkenny), and a large portion of Longford.</p>  <p>  In relation to the remaining barracks, agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford to Donegal County Council, Castlebar to Mayo County Council and Clonmel to Tipperary County Council. It is expected that these sales will be fully completed shortly.</p>  <p>  The remaining part of Longford Barracks has been reserved for sale to the Office of Public Works for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence. Approximately eight acres of Magee Barracks has been sold to the Department of Education to facilitate the construction of a new school and it is expected to auction the remaining portion of the barracks in 2015.</p>  <p>Columb Barracks in Mullingar is currently used by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes and a large part of the barracks has been licensed to Westmeath GAA Board for use as a potential centre of excellence. Discussions are at an advanced stage with the Board in relation to the possible long term lease of the facility. Discussions are also ongoing with a number of other interested parties regarding future use of Mullingar.</p>  <p>  In addition to the barracks outlined above, a number of other properties have also been identified as surplus to military requirements over recent years. These include married quarters, Reserve Defence Force (RDF) premises and training lands. A large number of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal.</p></reply>

I understand that eighteen to twenty full-time equivalent posts are in question. I am also conscious of the support given by Deputies, both independent and from across the Parties, to finding a workable solution which can reconcile the competing human resource, regulatory independence and other considerations involved, during their detailed discussion of these very aspects of the Bill during D&aacute;il Committee Stage.

The ten issues outlined in the Deputy's Parliamentary Question of 10 February 2015  formed the agenda for the policy element of my discussions with the group. Having carefully listened to their proposals on the issues raised at the meeting, I explained my views to them.</p>  <p>  Sentencing was the main issue discussed. I explained that the mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment, as provided by section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990. I also explained that a sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such a prisoner has no right to be released early at any stage. If granted temporary release, the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence and can be recalled to prison at any time. Currently a person sentenced to life is, on average, likely to spend 17-18 years in prison before receiving any extended period of temporary release.  This means that the imposition of multiple life sentences, whether concurrently or consecutively, in a case where more than one murder is committed in the same incident, does not increase the severity of the sanction and has no such effect in practice or in law. </p>  <p>  On the offence of manslaughter, this does not attract a mandatory sentence but is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.  I explained that the courts are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law and that an important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. I stated that I have no plans at present to amend the law to provide for a specific minimum term of imprisonment for murder or to replace the offence of manslaughter with offences of different degrees of murder.</p>  <p>  In terms of bail law, a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions because of the constitutional presumption in favour of bail which arises from the fact that, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restricts the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.   	</p>  <p>  As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage. Some revised provisions (adjusted to take account of the Attorney General's advice on the draft General Scheme) were sent to the Office of the Attorney General last month and a response is awaited.  Following consideration of these issues it is expected that Government approval for the General Scheme will then be sought and the General Scheme will be published.</p>  <p>  While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new provisions will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  The new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against the commission of offences by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  Finally, in terms of parole and release, I can advise the Deputy that proposals are currently being prepared to establish a Parole Board on a statutory footing. </p>  <p>  In September 2014 I published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy. As an initial step, the Government agreed in principle in November 2014 to proceed with the implementation of a number of key recommendations, including the bringing forward of legislative proposals to establish a Parole Board on a statutory footing. </p>  <p>  Work is underway on the preparation of a General Scheme and will be submitted to Government for consideration in due course.</p></reply>

Under the ECCE programme, all pre-school leaders were required to hold a Level 5 qualification.  In addition, pre-school services could qualify for a higher capitation rate where all the pre-school leaders, in the ECCE room, held a Level 7 qualification, and all the pre-school assistants held a Level 5 qualification. This represented a major step forward in improving the quality of early years.</p>  <p>  Nearly all of the pre-school services in the country are participating in the ECCE programme.  In 2010, a total of 3,787 services were under contract to deliver the free pre-school year under the ECCE programme. Of these 82 per cent met the basic capitation criteria, and 11 per cent met the higher capitation criteria.  In 2015, a total of 4,371 services are under contract to deliver the ECCE programme with 72 per cent meeting the basic capitation criteria, and  28 per cent meeting the higher capitation criteria.</p>  <p>  According to the findings from the Annual Survey of Early Years Services (2014), which is undertaken by Pobal on the Department&rsquo;s behalf,  almost 87 per cent of staff in early years services hold a qualification equal to or higher than the Level 5 qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and almost 50 per cent of staff hold a Level 6 qualification or higher on the NFQ. The findings of the survey also show that almost 5 per cent of staff hold qualifications at Level 7 (ordinary degree) and over 9 per cent hold a Level 8 (honours degree) award.</p></reply>

It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS Action Plan. It involves 124 locally managed projects and provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has had operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, Tusla allocated &euro;24.756 million to this programme. Tusla has confirmed that there will be no change to the overall budget in 2015. Local projects have been advised that consideration is being given to allocating increased funding towards strengthening governance in the Programme.</p>  <p>  I am informed that School Completion Programmes in Donegal were allocated &euro;1,011,476.41 for the 2014/15 school year.  Tusla has asked Chairpersons of Local Management Committees to prepare their school retention plans for the 2015/2016 school year based on the expenditure allocated last year and to return them to the Agency by June 16th last. I am advised that the Agency is currently assessing these plans. Local Projects including those in Donegal will be informed of their 2015/16 budgets before the start of the new school year. The ESRI is currently reviewing the School Completion programme which will help in future decisions on its structure, governance and operations. The report is almost finalised and it is expected to be available in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services.  The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency&rsquo;s educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving. </p></reply>

Approximately 65,000 children are participating in this Programme in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The issue of access to the free pre-school year for children with special needs was considered when the ECCE Programme was launched and a number of measures were introduced by my Department to make the Programme more accessible for these children. These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year. </p>  <p>  In addition, while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. </p>  <p>  This Government recognises however, that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for pre-school children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within the ECCE Programme.</p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health have agreed to work together to develop a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.  My Department is leading the process, with full and active support from the other two Departments and their respective agencies.  </p>  <p>  A group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin City Childcare Committee has started its work.  This Group aims to have an agreed model by early September, with a view to making a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required in time for the Estimates process. </p>  <p>  It is likely that the option and associated cost of providing children with 15 hours of special needs support to allow them to participate in the ECCE Programme will be one of a number of models that will be considered and costed by the Group as part of its work.</p></reply>

As part of this process, all staff working directly with children in pre-school services will be required to hold a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), or the equivalent. This minimum qualification will be a requirement under the revised Childcare Regulations and, when commenced, staff who wish to continue in employment in the childcare sector must satisfy this new qualification requirement. </p><p>In relation to the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, it will be a contractual requirement that all pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year hold a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 6 on NFQ  or the equivalent. </p><p>Specific funding of &euro;3 million has been provided in 2014/15 under the Learner Fund to assist staff already working in the childcare sector to meet these new childcare qualification requirements.  I understand that all eligible applicants were approved for funding with almost 3,000 childcare staff supported to meet the new qualification requirements.</p><p>Funding is provided to each City or County Childcare Committee (CCC) to provide for the number of childcare staff in their region that have been approved for support under the Learner Fund to undertake Level 5 and Level 6 courses with training providers from an approved panel.  Participating staff avail of the courses by way of classroom attendance or by enrolling for online courses or by a mix of these two options.  Some staff may undertake all 8 modules which make up the Major Award with others undertaking a smaller number which would be the balance required for them to achieve the major award.  The maximum cost per module for those participating in classroom based courses is &euro;200 per module with the Fund providing &euro;150 of this amount.  For those availing of blended/online courses, the cost per module is &euro;150 with the Fund providing &euro;120 of that amount. </p><p>There were two opportunities provided for staff to enrol for these courses and a breakdown of funding provided and the numbers of staff availing of the fund in each CCC area is shown below. </p><p>Pobal has indicated that 74 per cent of staff supported by the Learner Fund were seeking to achieve the Level 6 award with 26 per cent seeking to achieve the Level 5 award.</p><p><b>Learner Fund</b><table><tr><th>City and County Childcare Committee<br /><br /></th><th>Round 1<br /><br />Budget <br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Round 2<br /><br />Budget <br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Total <br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Round 1<br /><br />No. of Learners</th><th>Round 2 <br /><br />No. of Learners</th><th>Total<br /><br />No. of Learners</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>12,960</td><td>3,900</td><td>16,860</td><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>17,310</td><td>9,510</td><td>26,820</td><td>16</td><td>10</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>94,327</td><td>35,820</td><td>130,147</td><td>84</td><td>36</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>52,080</td><td>14,130</td><td>66,210</td><td>45</td><td>13</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>159,360</td><td>72,056</td><td>231,416</td><td>143</td><td>64</td><td>207</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>16,530</td><td>9,300</td><td>25,830</td><td>16</td><td>9</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>311,040</td><td>184,620</td><td>495,660</td><td>275</td><td>168</td><td>443</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown </td><td>59,940</td><td>62,244</td><td>122,184</td><td>62</td><td>63</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td>110,400</td><td>127,206</td><td>237,606</td><td>107</td><td>128</td><td>235</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>57,960</td><td>58,467</td><td>116,427</td><td>58</td><td>62</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>47,520</td><td>4,080</td><td>51,600</td><td>43</td><td>4</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>96,450</td><td>95,197</td><td>191,647</td><td>96</td><td>94</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>22,229</td><td>4,563</td><td>26,792</td><td>22</td><td>7</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>75,300</td><td>31,020</td><td>106,320</td><td>65</td><td>29</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>11,674</td><td>8,800</td><td>20,474</td><td>11</td><td>7</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>54,600</td><td>51,600</td><td>106,200</td><td>52</td><td>48</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>6,530</td><td>4,080</td><td>10,610</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>46,576</td><td>48,090</td><td>94,666</td><td>43</td><td>47</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>27,420</td><td>12,900</td><td>40,320</td><td>25</td><td>13</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>156,364</td><td>43,410</td><td>199,774</td><td>154</td><td>43</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>14,520</td><td>7,650</td><td>22,170</td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>25,440</td><td>10,550</td><td>35,990</td><td>22</td><td>13</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>16,470</td><td>17,118</td><td>33,588</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>23,610</td><td>21,930</td><td>45,540</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin </td><td>100,390</td><td>82,650</td><td>183,040</td><td>104</td><td>83</td><td>187</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North </td><td>18,572</td><td>3,390</td><td>21,962</td><td>19</td><td>6</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South </td><td>37,785</td><td>38,712</td><td>76,497</td><td>37</td><td>38</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>15,538</td><td>19,620</td><td>35,158</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>29,070</td><td>12,120</td><td>41,190</td><td>29</td><td>11</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>24,960</td><td>15,390</td><td>40,350</td><td>26</td><td>16</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>88,000</td><td>40,200</td><td>128,200</td><td>81</td><td>40</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1,830,924</td><td>1,150,323</td><td>2,981,247</td><td>1,716</td><td>1,130</td><td>2,846</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The programme builds on and continues the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) 2007-2013 which was co-funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) and The Atlantic Philanthropies (AP).</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme targets joint investment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and The Atlantic Philanthropies of &euro;29.7m in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in disadvantaged areas.  It aims to break &ldquo;the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions&rdquo; in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The ABC programme is currently being evaluated under the guidance of an Expert Advisory Group.  The evaluation adopts a shared measurement framework across all ABC programme sites.  The evaluation will consider the implementation and cost of programmes, and crucially how the outcomes for children and families in ABC areas have changed during the course of the programme.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the evaluation of the ABC programme my Department has established a task-focused group to examine how best to mainstream the learning from the ABC programme in the domains of policy and provision to improve outcomes for children and young people.  This Task Group comprises representatives of the ABC sites and will explore how the mainstreaming of the learning from effective evidence-informed approaches can best be progressed.  It is anticipated that the group will provide a succinct discussion paper outlining feasible options relating to the mainstreaming of learning for the consideration of the ABC Interdepartmental Project Team in the last quarter of 2015.</p>  <p>  Outputs from both of these processes will be key to informing considerations regarding the mainstreaming of learning emerging from the ABC programme.</p></reply>

It should be noted that this amount also covered costs associated with a meeting in Brussels on 16<sup>th</sup>June 2011 between the two Department of Health officials and the EU Commission in relation to the private health insurance market.  The costs arising in the case of those attending from the Health Insurance Authority were met by the Authority.</p><p>The study visit to Germany in March 2012 involved a meeting between officials from my Department  (1 Principal Officer) and the HSE and the Inek Institute (German Institute for Hospital Remuneration).  The discussions centred on hospital financing, notably Germany&rsquo;s experience with its DRG case-based prospective system for funding hospitals.  The total cost incurred by my Department amounted to &euro;244.98.  This is exclusive of a sum of &euro;124 in respect of the return journey by train from Frankfurt Airport to the Inek Institute in Siegburg which was paid for by the HSE. </p><p>With regard to symposiums/conferences on UHI organised by officials in my Department since March 2011, the position is as follows:</p><p>- a seminar on UHI was held in Dublin in April 2011 which was attended by 4<font color="#FF0000"> </font>experts from the World Health Organization, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and the Dutch Health Ministry.  The costs associated with this seminar amounted to &euro;1,981.27 covering the cost of attendance (travel and accommodation) of the experts.</p><p>- a one day policy dialogue symposium on the design of the health basket under UHI was held in Dublin in November 2013.  It was facilitated by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and included 5 international experts from the Netherlands, Israel and the WHO/European Observatory.  The costs associated with this policy dialogue amounted to &euro;3,359 covering the cost of attendance (travel and accommodation) of the five international experts.</p><p>Finally, the Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance was established in March 2012 to assist in developing detailed and costed implementation proposals for universal health insurance and to help drive the implementation of various elements of the reform programme.  The Group held a total of 10 meetings during 2012 and 2013.  The Implementation Group membership comprised a mix of those with executive responsibilities within the health service as well as external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organization, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and others.  The costs associated with the attendance of the international experts at the meetings (travel and accommodation) amounted to &euro;2,165.54.</p></reply>

As an approved centre for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme residents can receive financial support towards their cost of care at Cobh.  The hospital also receives funding from the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary (including Cobh Community Hospital) and private - have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  Demand for capital investment for the Community Nursing Unit programme far exceeds the funding available, and investment must therefore be allocated as effectively as possible based on the HSE's assessment of priorities. At present this funding programme focuses on the upgrade and refurbishment of existing public facilities to achieve compliance with HIQA requirements.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Scheme is currently the subject of a Review.  This review is considering the Scheme&rsquo;s long term sustainability as well as looking at how well the current model of provision is balancing residential care with care in the community, and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want.</p><p>While there will always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.</p><p>The HSE provides a range of community-based services aimed at ensuring older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity, and as close to home as possible.  Services are provided on a prioritised basis based on a care needs assessment and availability of resources.</p><p>In its National Service Plan (NSP) for 2015 the HSE stated that it will continue to progress the strategic realignment of services to provide home care and community support services in order to maximise the potential of older people in their own homes and communities.  The levels of home supports planned for in the NSP are:</p><p><b>-10.3 million</b><b>hours</b>of home help service supporting <b>50,000 people - </b>this is same level of service as 2014;</p><p><b>-13,800 people</b>in receipt of a home care packages at any one time - this includes an additional 600 people supported under the delayed discharges initiative;</p><p><b>-190 people</b>in receipt of an intensive home care package at any one time - these packages were introduced for the first time in 2014 for people with more complex care needs.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>Similar to other healthcare schemes operated by EU Member States under Community legislation, access to healthcare abroad  under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways, hence the HSE has in particular concentrated on informing the doctors who make the referrals.  For example, prior to the transposition of the Directive the HSE met with the ICGP and various consultants at hospital level to inform them of the provisions of the new Directive.  The HSE has also participated in an EU Patients Forum conference which was held in Dublin in April to inform patient groups of the Directive.  </p><p>Additionally, the HSE is at this time actively engaged with consultants representing two specific cohorts of patients to facilitate access to certain diagnostics and treatment for which there are long waiting lists in Ireland.  The HSE welcomes requests from Hospital Medical Boards to present and inform the doctors of the provision to refer patients to other EU/EEA countries for healthcare under the terms of the Directive.</p></reply>

Persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. Those charges are a per diem rate set out in the 2013 legislation and were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost, but they are not directly related to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals. </p>  <p>  The issue of hospital financing has been the subject of recent Departmental reports. In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended. It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs. Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system. Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).</p>  <p>  Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and daycase activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken.  This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.  It would require substantial technical work and analysis on the financial impact on public hospitals. The focus for the short to medium term is on implementing ABF in the public system, as outlined in the recently launched HSE ABF Implementation Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017. Until this further work has been completed it will not be possible to present the Deputy with the figure requested.</p></reply>

One of those key reforms has been the introduction of generic drug substitution and reference pricing as provided for by The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p>  <p>  The Act permits pharmacists to substitute medicines prescribed, provided that they have been designated as safely interchangeable by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). Generic substitution is being introduced incrementally, with the HPRA prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest saving for patients and the State.  This process will continue until all medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.</p>  <p>  The Act also allows the HSE to set a reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  By the end of January 2015 the HSE had set reference prices for 110 interchangeable groups across 37 different medicines / combinations.  Reference pricing has generated over &euro;47 million in savings in 2014 and is expected to deliver a further &euro;25 million in 2015. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p>  <p>  Another measure to promote the use of generic medicines is the work being undertaken by the HSE's Medicines Management Programme.  The programme actively engages with General Practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing including generic prescribing.</p>  <p>  As part of our wider Troika commitments a target for generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume was set at 70% by the end of 2016.  By end Q1 2015 generics accounted for over 70%, thus we have already met the 2016 target.</p></reply>

It states: "In 2015 the focus will be on achieving full EWTD compliance by reallocation of clinical tasks to the most appropriate member of staff, introduction of electronic time and attendance systems and reorganisation of acute services, supported by new management structures for hospitals services being progressed under Hospital Groups. In some settings, large-scale changes to existing acute hospital services are required to achieve full compliance."</p>  <p>  It is recognised therefore that reorganisation and reconfiguration of acute services is required to achieve full EWTD compliance. Any changes to services will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner and will take account of existing patient flows, the level of demand in hospitals and the new Group Hospital structures. Service provision, achievement of EWTD compliance and patient safety and outcomes will be priorities of the HSE in the development of the plan to support the attainment of compliance. The specific details of the plan will also be subject to the Court of Justice ruling on EWTD due on the 9th July 2015, in particular the extent, if any, to which protected training time constitutes working time. Currently the HSE and IMO have a collective agreement that excludes such time.</p></reply>

A DRG system has been operational in Irish hospitals for over 20 years with the AR-DRG grouping system used to group each hospital&rsquo;s inpatient and daycase workload into approximately 1,050 DRGs.  Until the end of 2013, the main use of the DRG system was to adjust the budget allocations of acute public hospitals by up to 3% in line with the complexity of their casemix and their relative performance under the Casemix System.  DRGs have also been used as a tool to assist with planning as well as monitoring and assessing performance within the acute hospital sector.</p>  <p>  Since January, 2014 the DRG system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF).  ABF is also referred to as Money Follows the Patient.  The new model involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken. As such, hospitals will be funded based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients.  They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Budgetary discipline will be delivered through the use of fixed budgets for ABF activity.  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the recently published &ldquo;ABF Implementation Plan&rdquo;, the new model is being rolled-out on a phased basis in public hospitals and full implementation will take a number of years.  January 2016 will be an important milestone in the process when block budgets for inpatient and daycase activity will be converted into ABF allocations for the first time.  It is intended that the payment system will extend over time to cover other hospital activity and eventually evolve so that money can follow the patient out of the hospital setting to primary care.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of ABF is an important step towards implementation of a commissioning or strategic purchasing model.  My Department has commenced the process of developing policy on a commissioning model in the Irish context that is aimed at improving the way the health system plans and arranges for the delivery of services.</p>  <p>  These reforms are designed to introduce a greater level of efficiency to the health service, and create a specific link between spending and activity. They do not seek to reduce overall spending.  Instead, the changes provide a more transparent funding mechanism that rewards hospitals more fairly for activity. The experience of other jurisdictions that have implemented ABF suggests that the funding model can deliver improved performance in important measures of system efficiency such as significantly reduced average lengths of stay, increased numbers of day of surgery admissions, and an increase in the number of discharges at the weekend.  However, it is important to note that ABF and commissioning will play an important role in driving improvements in quality and patient safety as well as efficiency.  The work of the National Clinical Programmes and the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee will be central to the future developments in this regard.</p></reply>

The Report, <i>&quot;Economic Cost and Burden of Eye Diseases and Preventable Blindness in Ireland&quot;</i>, which was part of a pan-European study of 16 countries, looks closely at the cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent eye disease and blindness.</p><p>The health service is addressing the prevention of eye disease and blindness across the broad range of health services including acute, primary and community based services.</p><p>Health service provision aimed at protecting people's eye health and, where necessary, providing supports to people with visual impairment, is based on the goals and principles of Healthy Ireland, rooted in primary care and integrated with and supported by secondary and specialist services for those who need them.  Eye care services are made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to children and to medical card holders and their dependants.  All pre-school children may avail of the child health examination route in order to be provided with any necessary optometric services.  Children of primary school age are usually screened twice during the primary school cycle and are referred for assessment and treatment if such is required.  Any refractive errors are treated and spectacles or other appropriate care is provided where necessary.  Other children between 12 and 16 years are seen by a HSE eye doctor when there is a medical reason for the eye condition, rather than refractive error.  Outpatient services, i.e. non-routine examination and/or treatment is provided for children in respect of defects noticed at child health or primary school examinations.</p><p>The HSE's National Clinical Programme on Diabetes, which includes care of children and adolescents with diabetes, was established in May 2010.  Diabetic retinopathy screening commenced in March 2013 and offers free, regular screening to children from age 12 to adults.  Systematic retinopathy screening on a population basis is both cost and clinically effective in identifying treatable eye disease.</p><p>The HSE has a Primary Care Eye Services Review Group, consisting of key stakeholders, in place to examine issues around primary care eye services including population needs and the adequacy of current services.  The Group will identify any current inadequacies and make recommendations as to how these should be addressed.  It will report later this year.</p><p>The HSE has put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently, in collaboration with acute hospitals, the Special Delivery Unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  These include maximising the use of capacity in public hospitals, through measures such as additional outpatient clinics and extending theatre hours, as well as outsourcing activity to private service providers through a public tendering process.  Ophthalmology services are included in the waiting lists to be addressed by such measures.  These are a key aspect of meeting the Minister for Health's commitment to reduce maximum permissible waiting times to 18 months by the end of June and 15 months by year end.</p><p>People with disabilities, including blind and visually-impaired people, can access specialist disability services, which are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  These may be provided directly by the HSE or in partnership with voluntary service providers such as the National Council for the Blind and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.</p><p>The Government remains committed to the provision and development of clinically effective and cost effective vision services and supports through prevention, screening and intervention policies and programmes, all of which will contribute to addressing the priority goal of the World Health Organisation's Vision 2020 initiative, namely to eliminate avoidable blindness.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-25a.604.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062500060#WRQ01000"><p>I have met the Irish Heart Foundation and am aware of their report.  In 2012 the Department commissioned a Health Impact Assessment of a sugar sweetened drinks tax, which concluded that, "Price increases tend to decrease demand but the degree to which this happens is variable because consumer behaviour and industry response to tax is difficult to predict".  Subsequent to this the European Region of the World Health Organisation (WHO), has recently published a document on the experience of other European countries and showed a mixed picture.  In some countries this is viewed as income generation and has no impact on consumption but in others the early indications suggest a reduction in consumption of sugar sweetened drinks.  This matter is being kept under review.  An Obesity Policy and Action Plan is currently under development and will address a broad range of measures to reduce the level of overweight and obesity in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Canadian authorities advise that it normally takes six weeks after an application is lodged for a Port of Entry (POE) Letter of Introduction to be issued.  This POE Letter of Introduction allows Irish citizens to work for two years in Canada.    Unfortunately, it appears that not all those citizens who have made these representations had complied with the advice provided by the Canadian authorities.

As an immediate response to the Gaza crisis, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 to the Emergency Appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to help provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families many of whom had to flee their homes. </p>  <p>  At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, which I attended last October, I pledged a further &euro;2.5 million towards both urgent immediate needs as well as long term recovery efforts.  &euro;1 million of this has been provided to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal. A further &euro;500,000 will be provided to UN partners this year with the remaining &euro;1 million of the pledge to be disbursed in 2016.</p>  <p>  The support provided to Gaza is in addition to our broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people which currently amounts to over &euro;10 million annually, and addresses immediate humanitarian needs, as well as development priorities, education and the promotion of human rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press, at EU level and elsewhere, to maintain focus on the humanitarian needs in Gaza and for an end to the blockade. The EU has consistently called for the opening of Gaza, and a broad change of Israeli policies there, most recently in the Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in November last. I made these points directly to the Israeli Foreign Minister during my visit to the region earlier this year.   Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have strongly advocated for a stronger EU involvement in the Peace Process. The Middle East Peace Process was discussed most recently at the May Foreign Affairs Council and HRVP Mogherini briefed Ministers on her recent visit to the region with EU Special Representative, Fernando Gentilini at this month&rsquo;s FAC. </p>  <p>  I endeavour to use all appropriate opportunities in my international engagements as Minister to press for progress in restarting peace talks in the region.

The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.  It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.  In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications was 28 February 2014.  All submissions were evaluated by my Department <i>in accordance with the criteria circulated to the local authorities.</i>On 2 May 2014, allocations from the Special Resolution Fund were announced and 86 developments were approved for funding.  The following link contains a list of all developments approved for SRF funding:</p><p>I can confirm that Sligo County Council submitted an application for funding from the SRF in respect of The Fairways, Ballygawley, which was not successful as there were no residents in occupancy and therefore did not meet the eligibility criteria of the scheme.</p><p>Each local authority has appointed an Unfinished Housing Development Co-ordinator; contact details can be found on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p></reply>

In relation to the disposal of land, elected members are required to be notified, under section 183 (1) of the 2001 Act, of any proposal to dispose of land held by a local authority (not being by demise for a term not exceeding one year).  Such notification shall include particulars of the land, the names of the persons from whom the land was acquired and to whom it is to be disposed of, and the consideration proposed in respect of the disposal.

The plan outlined the following main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea:a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market; <blockquote>-mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations;<br /><br />-  ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers; and,<br /><br />-  an improvement of water quality.</blockquote>Mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations is addressed via a Trap and Transport (T&amp;amp;T) on the Shannon, Erne and Lee, managed by ESB Fisheries. This involves the capture of adult eels migrating to sea, transporting them around the hydro power installations and releasing them.  In addition elver traps are installed at all ESB hydropower stations to facilitate the upstream movement of juvenile eels. </p><p>The independent Standing Scientific Committee on Eels sets targets of quantities to be transported annually. This Committee comprises scientists from the Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the Loughs Agency, the Agriculture, Food and Biosciences Institute for Northern Ireland (AFBINI) the Electricity Supply Board (ESB),the Marine Institute (MI) and third level institutes. The advice from the SSCE is independent of the parent agencies. </p><p>While the operation of both T&amp;amp;T and elver trap actions are day to day operational issues for ESB, I am advised by ESB that the overall T&amp;amp;T targets for each of the three fisheries have been consistently met. I am also advised that ESB installed additional traps in 2015 at Ballyshannon and Parteen. All other traps, including trap substrates, ramps, water flow and tanks at all ESB locations (Ballyshannon, Parteen, Ardnacrusha &amp;amp; Inniscarra) were refurbished and upgraded in early 2015. </p><p>ESB also confirmed that all traps were operational before 17 March this year. The traps at Parteen and Ardnacrusha were inspected on Thursday 12 March by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI). The traps at Ballyshannon, which are on a trans-boundary waterway, were jointly inspected on Friday 13 March by both IFI and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland.</p><p>There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  </p></reply>

It is an EU-wide network of nature protection areas established under the 1992 Habitats Directive. The aim of the network is to assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats.  It is comprised of special areas of conservation (also referred to as sites of community importance in the EU context) designated by Member States under the Habitats Directive and special protection areas which are designated under the 1979 Birds Directive. </p>  <p>  The establishment of this network of protected areas also fulfils a Community obligation under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. </p>  <p>  Bull Island is contained within the North Dublin Bay special area of conservation. It is also the focal point of the North Bull Island special protection area, formally designated in 2010 by Statutory Instrument (S.I. 211 of 2010). It is also recognised as a UNESCO biosphere by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. This biosphere designation has now been extended to Dublin Bay.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of this Statutory Instrument, harvesting marine species, unless regulated by another public body or unless for personal use, may only be undertaken on the site with my consent, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The site has been monitored by officials from my Department and I understand that bait digging is recognised as a management issue. However, I am advised there are significant operational challenges associated with the regulation and management of such activities that require careful consideration in the context of the overall ecological requirements of the site.</p></reply>
