    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-21a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112100063#WRA00800"><p>I can confirm that neither myself nor officials from my Department have had discussions with executives from Apple regarding the proposed data centre, or its energy supply source, in Athenry.  However my officials occasionally meet with IDA representatives and their client companies as part of routine engagement on wider energy policy developments.</p><p>The level of interest from energy intensive industry such as data centres, in Ireland has increased in recent years and has the potential to drive growth in electricity demand.  Significantly, one of the key reasons cited for this increased level of interest is Ireland&rsquo;s positive record in the area of renewable energy deployment. </p><p>Data centres consume very large amounts of energy and the scale and quantity of their development presents challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s national grid. EirGrid, the state&rsquo;s electricity transmission system operator, makes considerable efforts to ensure that the electricity system can cope with the increasing demands placed on it by the increase in the number of data centres in the last decade, as well as planning to meet future demands, as reflected in their <i>Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios 2017</i>publication.</p><p>According to EirGrid&rsquo;s latest Generation Capacity Statement there are currently approximately 250 megavolt amperes (MVA) of installed data centres in Ireland.  Megavolt ampere is the electricity terminology mainly used for grid connections.  Furthermore, there are connection offers either in place or in the pipeline for a further 600 MVA.  At present, there are enquiries for more than 1,000 MVA of additional data centres.  These statistics demonstrate the scale of energising existing and proposed data centres.</p><p>In recognition of the economic potential that data centres can bring to Ireland, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in conjunction with other relevant Ministers is leading a  cross-government effort to develop a national policy statement on the strategic importance of data centres as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy, with a first draft expected later this year.  This strategic policy approach will include proposed amendments to the Strategic Infrastructure Act and take account of wider energy policy developments.  I am firmly of the view that the development of data centres must be plan lead, focused on areas where there is strong grid and energy supply.  The policy statement must lay out a clear and balanced approach to the development of the sector, one that will take account of a variety of elements including regional development, costs and benefits and the impact on Ireland&rsquo;s electricity grid.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-21a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112100063#WRA01100"><p>The Government gave a commitment to consumers to carefully monitor the transition in the sector when introducing the measure to phase out flat fees for household waste collection.  Accordingly, I established a Household Waste Collection Price Monitoring Group.  Its role is to track the rates charged by waste collectors across the country as flat rate fees are being phased out.</p>  <p>  The Price Monitoring Group is chaired by Mr Frank Conway, an independent consumer finances expert, and comprises representatives from the Waste Policy and Resource Efficiency Division and an economist from my Department, a statistician from the Central Statistics Office, and a market research company with expertise in price monitoring.  The company has now completed two data sweeps of the market and has reported the data to the Group.  The Price Monitoring Group will continue its monthly market surveillance during the flat-fee phase out.   </p>  <p>  In addition, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to conduct a study on the operation of the household waste collection market.  The CCPC has commenced work in this regard and it hopes to finalise the study in early 2018.   </p>  <p>  The CCPC has also outlined its role vis-&agrave;-vis the Household Waste Collection Price Monitoring Group.  It indicated that it would not be appropriate for it to take part on the Price Monitoring Group as any commentary by that Group could prove problematic in the context of the independent Commission's review of the market.  Furthermore, it clarified that its involvement in the Price Monitoring Group could potentially prejudice any future enforcement action that the Commission might deem necessary in the sector. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the results from the Household Waste Collection Price Monitoring Group will be monitored and analysed.  Its surveillance, in conjunction with the study being undertaken by the CCPC, will provide an evidence base regarding future monitoring or the potential need for additional regulation of the waste market.</p></reply>

The decision concluded a lengthy planning process which included an Oral Hearing completed over eleven weeks from March to May last year.  The planning process for the section of the project in Northern Ireland is on-going following the conclusion of an oral hearing on 27 February 2017.</p>  <p>  Following the motions calling for an updated independent study that were passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann earlier this year, I have commissioned two independent studies designed to address the main points of the motions as well as key concerns expressed by parties opposed to the development of an overhead line. </p>  <p>  The first is an independent study to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the interconnector.  I have approved the appointment of independent experts to carry out this study and their work commenced in August.  The consultants are Bo Normark, who will Chair the Group, Professor Ronnie Belmans and Professor Keith Bell.  This Independent Expert Group is expected to deliver its final report by the end of January next and indeed were in Ireland for a variety of meetings in the course of their research on Thursday and Friday last week (16-17 November).</p>  <p>  I have also commissioned a study on the levels of compensation provided to land and property owners in proximity to high-voltage transmission lines in a European context.​  Work is well underway on this study and its results are expected in Quarter 1 2018.</p>  <p>  The results of both commissioned studies will be published prior to the conclusion of this procurement process.  In addition, no work will be commissioned during the procurement process.</p></reply>

The Government will study the Assembly&rsquo;s report and recommendations systematically and comprehensively when it receives them and will provide its response to each recommendation of the Assembly in the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Assembly&rsquo;s work on this module, I also understand that it has been invited to consider how the National Dialogue on Climate Action should engage with the wider public to create awareness,engagement and motivation to act in relation to the challenges of climate change.  I expect that the report of the Citizens' Assembly will provide valuable input and ideas from which to draw on in the preparation of further activities under the National Dialogue in the coming months.</p>  <p>  In the context of my engagement with representatives of Irish NGOs at COP 23 last week I was also pleased to note the very positive response to the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and the suggestion that, together with the National Dialogue on Climate Action, these models for participatory engagement could be showcased at future COP meetings in the spirit of the &lsquo;Talanoa&rsquo; Dialogue that is now to be taken forward under the Fijian COP Presidency. </p>  <p>  In general terms, I was pleased to note that many of the recommendations adopted by the members of the Assembly, as reported on during the second weekend of this module, are already being addressed in the National Mitigation Plan and in the implementation of the Energy White Paper, but I also acknowledge that other recommendations will need further consideration in the context of the Government&rsquo;s response to the report of the Assembly. </p></reply>

As energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are inextricably linked, meeting this objective will require a radical transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil-fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  </font><font color="#0D0D0D">The level of interest from energy intensive industry, such as data centres, in Ireland has increased in recent years and has the potential to drive growth in electricity demand.  Significantly, one of key reasons cited for this increased level of interest is Ireland&rsquo;s positive record in the area of renewable energy deployment.  Ireland is also seen as having a number of additional advantages as a location for data centre development including: climate; fibre internet connectivity; energy supply; and its business environment.  In recognition of the economic benefits that data centres can bring to Ireland, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business,  Enterprise and Innovation, in conjunction with other relevant Ministers, is leading inter-Departmental work to develop a national policy statement on the strategic importance of data centres as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy, with a first draft expected later this year.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  This strategic policy approach is expected to include proposed amendments to the </font>Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006,<font color="#1F497D"> </font><font color="#0D0D0D">and to take account of wider energy and climate policy perspectives.  I am firmly of the view that the development of data centres must be in areas where there is strong grid and energy supply.  The policy statement must set out a clear and balanced approach to the development of the sector, one that will take account of a variety of elements including regional development, costs and benefits, and the impact on Ireland&rsquo;s electricity grid.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">As Minister with responsibility for both climate action and energy policy, I am mindful that an increase in energy demand may have implications for both our climate and renewable energy targets. In light of economic growth indicators and energy demand growth forecasts, which include projected data centre growth, my Department is working to support and encourage the development of additional levels of renewable generation technologies via a new Renewable Energy Support Scheme which is currently under development.  My Department received 1,250 submissions to the final consultation on the RESS which closed in early November.  I am keen that this new Scheme encourages the diversification of renewable energy technologies in Ireland, while mindful of the need to minimise the costs on the consumers through the Public Service Obligation.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, including at data centre sites, as I believe that micro-generation could have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, increasing social acceptance of, and helping to offset, any potential growth in emissions from a future increase in energy demand.</font></p></reply>

A significant milestone in that process was reached in September with the submission of Detailed Solutions by two bidders.  These Detailed Solutions are being evaluated by my Department&rsquo;s specialist NBP team.  This is the last stage of the procurement process before receipt of final tenders and progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder or bidders. </p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and the frustration for communities that do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.  Delivering high speed connectivity to all 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder or bidders to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.  In the interim, practical initiatives will continues to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p></reply>

The revised ambition of the NBP now aims to provide access to high speed broadband to every home and business in the country.  Since then, my predecessors and I have held a number of media briefings to inform the public of key milestones in the development of the revised Plan.  For example:</p><p>- In November 2014 the then Minister, Alex White, published the High Speed Broadband Map and the public consultation  <font color="#1F497D">;</font></p><p>- In June 2015,  former Minister White launched the draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation;</p><p>- December 2015 saw the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map and Strategy and the formal launch of the procurement process by former Minister White;</p><p>- In July 2016 I announced the Government decision in relation to the ownership model for the network to be built and the shortlisting of three companies as bidders in the procurement process.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-21a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112100064#WRB01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 61 together.</p><p>Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.  I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at<i>consumerline@comreg.ie</i>and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. </p><p>Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July 2016, I established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. </p><p>The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. Meetings were held in March and July and the next is scheduled for tomorrow. </p><p>The two quarterly reports published to date demonstrate the good progress made in delivering the actions, and the third such report to be published shortly after tomorrow&rsquo;s Implementation Group meeting, will reflect that continuing progress and also the sustained level of engagement between actions owners and industry.  </p><p>This engagement was clear in the October first National Stakeholder Forum in Athlone which I hosted with Minister Kyne.  It arose from the Taskforce&rsquo;s recognition that, given the rapid technological change and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, stakeholders needed an opportunity to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services.  Issues impacting on rollout were discussed at the Forum, and there were also some new recommended actions for the Taskforce to help improve services to consumers and in preparing for roll-out of the National Broadband Plan network, once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:</p><p>- Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer;</p><p>- Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies, including Government working closely with local authorities to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs to be connected at an early juncture after award of the NBP contract;</p><p>- ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services.  ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map.</p><p>- Most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development.</p><p>- Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out.  TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms. </p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. </p><p>All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

At the same time, it is  important that if payments for use of public charge points are introduced in the future, they are at a level which does not disincentivise the uptake of electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles.  A key focus of the work of the Taskforce is examining options for infrastructure, regulation and pricing in order to devise a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce is assessing the decision of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in its examination of the future requirements for electric vehicle recharging infrastructure.  The work of the Taskforce is well underway and has already resulted in a package of measures in Budget 2018 designed to promote a low carbon, electric vehicle future.  The Taskforce is also planning a stakeholder workshop later this month to explore issues related to the future requirements for electric vehicle recharging infrastructure.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, including Solar Photovoltaics (Solar PV) and both onshore and offshore wind, at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. </p><p>The 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines set the framework and extent of financial support options for national renewable electricity (RES-E) support schemes.  In general and except for small scale and demonstration projects, RES-E support levels must be set through competitive bidding processes and all new RES-E schemes should provide support in the form of a premium in addition to the market price.  This support mechanism is very different to current schemes in place in Ireland where all renewable electricity generators within specific sectors get a fixed price for the electricity they export to the national grid.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses have been a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.</p><p>The analysis also assessed a range of renewable electricity penetration ambitions, informed by Eirgrid&rsquo;s 2017 Generation Capacity Statement, to measure their impact on cost and their likely technological composition. </p><p>A cornerstone of the new scheme will be the provision of pathways for increased community ownership and participation in and benefit from renewable electricity projects in line with the 2015 Energy White Paper commitments. Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken.  The most effective policies to increase community ownership and participation in renewable electricity projects have been examined within an Irish context.  Examples include a mandatory requirement for all projects supported under RESS to offer ownership or investment opportunities to the local population, facilitating grid access for community-led renewable projects, ring fencing dedicated capacity for community-led projects and putting in place structures which will support community groups overcome legal, financial and technical barriers to renewable electricity generation.  Furthermore, the Government recognizes that Solar PV has the potential to contribute to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy and climate change objectives and could also provide a community dividend, thereby enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future. </p><p>Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment.  The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed.  These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account.  This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p><p>I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country.  My Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation last month and will develop a policy position on how best to support micro generation and micro generators in Ireland.</p><p>A public consultation on the emerging principles of the proposed RESS closed on 10 November.  Over 1,250 submissions were received and these will now be reviewed and considered and will inform the final design of the RESS.  Following on from this public consultation and review, a final proposal will be brought to Government for approval in early 2018, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported.  Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. </p><p>The Economic Report to underpin the design of the new scheme (assessing a range of renewable technologies at different scales and against a range of sensitivities e.g. renewable ambitions) and the Community Report, which identifies and assesses renewable electricity community policies and measures, were published as part of the public consultation process and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dccae.ie. </i></p><p>At this point no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS.  I welcome and have noted with interest the falling costs of some renewable technologies over the past year, most notably Solar PV and offshore wind.  Increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver and falling technology costs may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.</p></reply>

I am also aware of the letter published by the Union of Concerned Scientists referred to in the Question from Deputy Daly.  The common theme in all of the referenced documents is that more urgent action needs to be undertaken by the international community to ensure the goals set out in the Paris Agreement can be met.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Government&rsquo;s commitment to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions over the longer term is set out in the 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Change and in the 2015 Energy White Paper.  These include ambitious long-term commitments, respectively, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% compared to 1990 levels and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector by between 80% and 95% by 2050.  As energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are inextricably linked, meeting this objective will require a radical transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominately fossil fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July.  This represents an important initial step to enable the transition in Ireland to a low carbon economy and society.  The Plan identifies over 70 mitigation measures and 106 related actions to address the immediate challenge to 2020 and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030.  Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The National Mitigation Plan will be subject to formal review at least once every five years and will also become a living document, accessible on my Department's website, which will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.  As this first Plan moves into the implementation phase, this process will enable it to be amended, refined and strengthened over time and assist in keeping Ireland on target to meet our obligations.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  </font>The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, aims to hold the g<font color="#222222">lobal average temperature increase to well below 2&deg;C, and to pursue efforts to limit this to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels. </font>The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement. Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the Nationally Determined Contribution submitted by the EU on behalf of its Member States, and which commits the EU to a 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  This is based on EU-wide reductions in the emissions trading system (ETS) sector of 43%, and in the non-ETS sector of 30%. Ireland's contribution to this overall EU effort for the non-ETS sector will be set out in the EU Effort Sharing Regulation, which is currently under negotiation.</p></reply>

Approximately 12,000 of these 68,000 premises form part of eir's planned rural deployment to deliver high speed broadband to 300,000 premises throughout Ireland between now and the end of 2018.  Figures provided to my Department show that, in Q3 2017, eir's rural deployment passed approximately 5,000 premises in County Donegal.  The remaining 33,000 premises in County Donegal fall within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>To improve both mobile phone and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area, I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention.  </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The Government will study the Assembly&rsquo;s report and recommendations systematically and comprehensively when it receives them and will provide its response to each recommendation of the Assembly in the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</p>  <p>  In general terms, I was pleased to note that many of the recommendations adopted by the members of the Assembly, as reported on during the second weekend of this module, are already being addressed in the National Mitigation Plan and in the implementation of the Energy White Paper, but I also acknowledge that other recommendations will need further consideration by Government. </p>  <p>  Upon publishing the National Mitigation Plan in July of this year, the Government explicitly recognised that this first statutory Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective.  It begins the process of development of medium to long term mitigation choices for the next and future decades, without underestimating the scale of what this entails.  Analysis underpinning the Plan suggests the bringing forward of additional measures with a cumulative greenhouse gas mitigation capacity of 89 Mt CO2eq over the period 2021 to 2030.  This will require significant societal transformation and, more immediately, very substantial investment by both the public and private sectors, as well as a broad range of non-financial policy tools including regulations, standards, education initiatives and targeted information campaigns.  Work is ongoing on the analysis and costing of various suites of measures that could meet the 2030 target as cost-effectively as possible, and the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly will feed into this work. </p>  <p>  While the Government, in its response to the Assembly&rsquo;s report, will also address the specific recommendation to end all subsidies for peat extraction on a phased basis over the next 5 years, it should be noted that the PSO support for Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Edenderry peat-fired power station expired in December 2015.  The Edenderry power station is now in receipt of support for biomass co-firing via the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff 3 (REFIT 3) support scheme for up to 30% of the size of the plant.  In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na has stated that it intends to cease harvesting peat for electricity generation by 2030.  The company has committed to replace large-scale peat production with alternative energy sources.  This will contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of electricity and is in keeping with the aims of the Energy White Paper.  On top of this, the PSO support for the ESB&rsquo;s West Offaly and Lough Ree peat power stations expire in 2019.  These two peat plants may, like Edenderry, also move to co-firing with biomass, and are eligible for support under REFIT 3.</p>  <p>  In this context, the National Mitigation Plan also recognises that fully realising the economic opportunities in the low carbon economy is key to ensuring a just transition, in particular for the groups and communities most affected by the scale of the transformation required such as those involved in peat extraction.  Investment in the low carbon economy has the potential to create decent work and quality jobs to support local communities and workers in regions most strongly impacted by the ongoing transformation to a decarbonised society.  In support of existing Government policy, as set out in the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, and the significant roles played by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Agencies in creating and sustaining employment and supporting enterprise development, a report will be prepared on the spatial or geographical economic and employment implications of the transition.  The National Dialogue on Climate Action will also afford citizens and communities the opportunity to actively participate and engage in this important area of Government policy.</p></reply>

Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The governance and reporting arrangements that underpin the National Mitigation Plan will be critical to successfully delivering on the full range of over 70 measures and 106 related actions in the Plan.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Under section 14 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is required to present an Annual Transition Statement to each House of the Oireachtas by 10 December each year.  The Annual Transition Statement for 2017 will have two main elements.  The &quot;Annual National Transition Statement&quot; will set out an overview of both mitigation and adaptation policy measures adopted; a record of emissions of greenhouse gases set out in the most recent national greenhouse gas emissions inventory and a projection of future greenhouse gas emissions; and a report on compliance by the State with any existing or future obligations under EU law or international agreements referred to in Section 2 of the Act.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In addition, each sectoral Minister designated under the 2015 Act for the purposes of the National Mitigation Plan (Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Housing, Planning and Local Government; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Agriculture, Food and the Marine) is required to include an &quot;Annual Sectoral Mitigation Transition Statement.&quot;  Each Sectoral Mitigation Transition Statement must set out a record of the sectoral mitigation measures adopted by the Minister of the Government presenting the annual sectoral mitigation transition statement concerned, and an assessment of the effectiveness of the sectoral mitigation measures in the achievement of their purpose.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Starting in 2018, it is my intention to produce an annual progress report on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan.  This annual progress report will incorporate the key provisions of the Annual Transition Statement and will also record progress in relation to each of the actions set out in the National Mitigation Plan.  In order to align the Annual Transition Statement requirements under the 2015 legislation with the National Mitigation Plan annual progress report, I propose to incorporate these into a single document from 2018 onwards.  This annual reporting process will facilitate debate on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan in both Houses of the Oireachtas in each subsequent year.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the Nationally Determined Contribution submitted by the EU on behalf of its Member States, and which commits the EU to a 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  This is based on EU-wide reductions in the emissions trading system (ETS) sector of 43%, and in the non-ETS sector of 30%.  Ireland's contribution to this overall EU effort for the non-ETS sector will be set out the EU Effort Sharing Regulation, which is currently under negotiation. </font></p></reply>

The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.</p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States. The specific details of Ireland's contribution are currently being negotiated between the EU and its Member States.</p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper &ldquo;Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030&rdquo; sets out a vision and framework to guide Irish energy policy and the actions that Government intends to take in the energy sector from now up to 2030, aimed at transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050.  This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.  The White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emissions fuels, e.g. moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas, and ultimately towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy.  In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency. In 2015, over 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was generated from renewable energy sources. </p>  <p>  The White Paper also recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.  </p>  <p>  Ireland sources all its oil needs from abroad. In addition, Ireland currently sources its gas supply from the Kinsale gasfields, the Corrib gasfield and the gas pipeline from Moffat in Scotland.  Corrib and Kinsale are not in a position to meet all of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas demand and so Ireland will continue to rely on gas via Great Britain for the foreseeable future.  The Kinsale fields are expected to cease production by 2021 while Corrib production is projected to decrease to 50 per cent of its initial levels by 2025.</p>  <p>  Taking this into account, exploration in Ireland&rsquo;s offshore has the potential to deliver benefits to Irish society and the economy, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply and reduced fossil fuel imports, as we transition to a low carbon future.  In that regard, I recently made a suggestion to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that Ireland's policy on energy security deserves a full debate by the committee in the context of our policy framework for energy transition, energy efficiency, renewable energy and offshore exploration. </p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg. </p><p>The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.  A European Commission Communication published on 7 November 2017<i>, </i><i>Two years after Paris &ndash; Progress towards meeting the EU&rsquo;s climate commitments</i><i></i>(COM (2017) 646), indicated that in addition to Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg and Malta are also expected to miss their 2020 EU targets on the basis of current projections. </p><p>Ireland's 2020 target is a binding obligation under EU law and Ireland is not seeking a derogation from it.  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using banked allowances from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which may result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p><p>Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan,  which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The Plan sets out what Ireland is currently doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015.  Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p><p>Delivery of the measures in the National Mitigation Plan  will, in many cases, require significant investment.  However, decisions on the funding of particular measures will be a matter for Government consideration in the context of expenditure planning in the Estimates and Budgetary processes, and in the forthcoming National Investment Plan for 2018-2027.  Individual investment or expenditure decisions will also, in the normal course, be subject to appropriate appraisal in line with the Government's Public Spending Code.</p><p>Where relevant, the National Mitigation Plan  already includes information on the expected Exchequer cost of implementing individual measures, either in the context of direct expenditure or in relation to tax foregone.  The actual expenditure on a given measure will depend on progress in implementation of each measure, including its possible expansion as a result of additional funding, for which the relevant sectoral Minister retains direct responsibility. </p><p>In addition to measures in place, the National Mitigation Plan includes measures under consideration by Government.  The potential costs for many of these measures have yet to be quantified and will depend on the basis on which a given measure is adopted for implementation. </p></reply>

Approximately 4,000 of these 78,000 premises form part of eir's planned rural deployment to deliver rural high speed broadband to 300,000 premises throughout Ireland between now and the end of 2018.  Quarter three figures provided to my Department show that, in Q3 2017, eir's rural deployment passed approximately 1,700 premises in County Kildare.  There are over 13,000 premises which fall within the AMBER area of the Map and which fall to be covered by the State Intervention area in County Kildare.</p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available from eir at <i></i>.  Citizens can access this website to determine the connectivity availability status for their premises using their eircode.  The website also provides a list of retail service providers who offer services using high speed fibre network in the area. </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team.  The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature. </p><p>As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and rollout.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The legislation sets out details on the tasks and inter-alia timelines, consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas, and identifies restrictions on the areas where such directions may not be given.</p><p>The electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive, and operate within a European regulatory regime that effectively seeks to end the regulation of electricity and gas retail markets of member states.The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices.  Competition exerts downward pressure on suppliers&rsquo; prices.</p><p>Responsibility for the regulation of the gas or electricity markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which carries out statutory market monitoring functions to ensure that competition continues to develop, and that customers benefit from competition.  Two reports published by the regulator this year conclude that Irish energy markets are competitive, with the most recently available EU comparable electricity and gas supplier switching data also pointing towards a competitive Irish market.  The CRU is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.</p><p>The regulation of retail market prices for electricity in Ireland ended in 2011 and for gas prices in 2014.  The Government has no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of electricity prices, with the main thrust of Government policy on energy costs focused on the competitive market and supports for energy efficiency.  Government policy , consistent with EU Legislation has supported competition  to drive down prices, and data from approved price comparison sites (and ) shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers.  Accordingly, attempting to revert to price controls is not considered an appropriate option. </p></reply>

How this is to achieved is set out in the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the latest version of which was published earlier this year and is available on my Department's website.  The achievement of this target requires a combination of shallow and deep retrofits, maximising the varying levels of capacity among householders to engage in energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  For example, simple, relatively inexpensive grant aided measures, such as attic and cavity wall insulation, can deliver a significant amount of energy savings at low cost, thus delivering value for money for the taxpayer, a short payback for the householders who make the investment and increased awareness of energy efficiency among citizens.  Focusing on these low cost, high impact measures first is important.  Research by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) clearly demonstrates that people who have a positive experience in undertaking a small energy efficiency upgrade are more likely to engage in further energy efficiency measures in the future. </p>  <p>  However, shallow interventions must be complemented by deeper interventions as these will be necessary to deliver the energy savings that are required to meet the Government's long term climate ambitions to reduce carbon emissions in the Built Environment.  This is why I have established two new energy efficiency schemes to deliver deep retrofits.  This year SEAI initiated the Deep Retrofit Pilot, which offers 50% grant funding for householders to bring the energy efficiency of their home up to an A3 on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale.  That funding increases to 95% for the homes of those who are living in energy poverty.  Commenced in 2016 and delivered by SEAI and the HSE, the Warmth and Wellbeing scheme makes deeper energy efficiency upgrades available free of charge, to people in, or at risk of, energy poverty who are also suffering from a  chronic respiratory condition.  The research component of this scheme will evaluate the impact improved energy efficiency can have on a person's health and wellbeing.  Over the last 2 years deeper measures have also been progressively rolled out in the Better Energy Communities and Warmer Homes schemes. </p>  <p>  The aim of all of this innovative activity is to build demand for deeper measures and market capacity to deliver them.  These initiatives will gather the evidence necessary to determine how best Government can motivate people to engage in deep retrofits on a much wider basis, build the necessary skills and the supply chain in the construction industry, and provide tangible demonstrations throughout the country on the most suitable deep retrofit options for various types of home.  In this context the newly established SEAI Behavioural Economics Unit has a critical role to play. </p></reply>

In particular, this requires the CSO to define the scope of the Public Sector (which includes the General Government Sector) in Ireland.  In fulfilment of this requirement the CSO maintains and publishes a Register of Public Sector Bodies in Ireland which is available at .  This register includes a listing of bodies classified in the general government sector, whose revenue, expenditure and financial balance sheet is included in the Government Finance Statistics reported to Eurostat and published nationally.  It also includes a listing of publicly controlled corporations not classified in the general government sector due to their market nature.</p><p>To compile this register the CSO use a number of sources including surveys of all central government departments, in co-operation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and all local authorities, in co-operation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This is done in order to confirm or revise existing listings and to obtain further information as needed on all bodies under the aegis of these government units to ensure their correct classification according to the relevant European System of Accounts 2010 criteria.  A preliminary analysis of the results of the central government survey conducted in 2017 is reflected in the latest version of the register.  Work on the local government survey and consequent updates to the register are ongoing.  The composition of the register is not static.  Government controlled bodies are established, closed and merged over time.  Also the market/non-market status of bodies must be continually reviewed.  Consequently the Register of Public Sector Bodies is reviewed and updated periodically (at least annually).</p><p>Data on publicly controlled corporations (including commercial and other semi State bodies) not classified to the General Government sector are reported annually to Eurostat in a Questionnaire on government controlled units classified outside general government.  This data includes a calculation of the quantitative market/non-market for the previous three years for those bodies whose total liabilities exceed 0.01% of GDP.  The CSO also conduct periodic reviews of the classification of bodies controlled by government either at its own initiative or on request by Eurostat or other government departments or agencies.  This work forms a central part of the preparation of Government Finance Statistics and is a core component of the work of the CSO Government Accounts division.</p></reply>

My Department has engaged with the retail sector on this issue through the Retail Consultation Forum, which I now Chair.  Specifically, it was raised and discussed at a meeting of the Retail Consultation Forum on 21 November 2016.</p>  <p>  In response, retailers explained that some of the differentials between prices quoted in Euro and Sterling may be attributed to such factors as the exchange rates at the time of the purchases by the retailers, the relative costs of doing business between the two jurisdictions, and tax rates.</p>  <p>  While it is not my function to set prices for retailers, it is my view that retailers should explain to their customers, and to the economies in which they operate, the reason for price differentials where they exist.  Actions by retailers to restore consumers&rsquo; confidence that they can get a fair deal will help not only to address issues around the differentials in prices but will also help in assisting businesses to retain trade and, thereby, help to maintain employment.</p>  <p>  I also recognise that retailers themselves are concerned about the impact of sterling fluctuations on Irish consumer sentiment.  Retail sales figures show that the volume of retail sales is growing at a faster rate than the value of sales growth, which indicates that there continues to be heavy discounting by retailers and promotional activities to drive footfall and sales.</p>  <p>  In October this year, Retail Ireland copied my office on their correspondence to Deputy Joan Burton following the Deputy's Parliamentary Question of 11th September on the issue of the fall in the value of sterling, outlining the reasons for any price differentials where they exist and the value that is available in stores across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Brexit, and the resulting consequences for both retailers and consumers, will continue to be a focus of the Retail Consultation Forum and was discussed in detail at the most recent meeting of the Forum on Monday 20 November.</p></reply>

DEASP also has responsibility for INTREO, the national contact point for employment and income supports, as well as acting as a pathway to employment for many job seekers.</p>  <p>  It is not usual to consult externally when it comes to the realignment of functional responsibilities between Government Departments.</p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit. This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p><p>Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p><p>As the outcome of the negotiations remains uncertain, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&rsquo;s contingency planning.</p><p>On 9 November, I published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo;.  This paper sets out work underway and planned by the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation and its Agencies in response to Brexit.</p><p>The paper summarises impacts of Brexit across key policy areas within the Department and outlines the policy and operational mitigation measures underway and planned by the Department and its Agencies to minimise risks and maximise opportunities associated with Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit.  It also describes the research programme designed to inform that response as well as new structures put in place to ensure a coherent approach across my Department and its Agencies.</p><p>Clearly, a disorderly exit would be very damaging, particularly for Ireland, and Michel Barnier&rsquo;s recent call for EU Member States to plan for such a contingency is fully in line with the Government&rsquo;s approach.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the various research projects underway in my Department to help build an understanding of the possible implications of Brexit on Ireland for enterprise, consumers and trading relations. These studies examine a range of scenarios and will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU and further mitigation measures to respond to Brexit.  The research projects considering a hard Brexit scenario are:<table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Summary</th></tr><tr><td>Sectoral implications arising from Brexit: Most exposed sectors  </td><td>This research examines the firm level implications of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union for Ireland&rsquo;s most exposed enterprise sectors.</td></tr><tr><td>Strategic Implications arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns</td><td>Profile trade and investment to highlight dependence at sectoral and product level; Quantify impact of various scenarios on trade and investment; Develop policy options for Ireland &ndash; negotiations and enterprise (mitigation) policies.</td></tr><tr><td>Import Content of Irish Exports and Implications of Brexit</td><td>This study examines the Import Content of Irish Exports: Implications of Brexit for Inputs and Competitiveness and the extent to which Irish firms source intermediate inputs from the UK. This research will provide empirical evidence on the import content of Irish firms&rsquo; exports, how firms may be exposed to changes in the trading environment after Brexit and the impact of Brexit on inputs, and competitiveness. </td></tr><tr><td>*The Potential Impact of WTO Tariffs and other key relevant issues on Cross-Border Trade</td><td>The first topic in the research programme examined scenarios on how trade flows between Ireland and Northern Ireland might be affected in the event of the imposition of WTO-level tariffs and other non-tariff barriers on cross-border trade in manufactured products. That report was published earlier this Summer.  Two remaining phases will be carried out - The second phase will assess some important aspects of how this cross-border trade is structured at a firm level and how flexible firms are in the face of trade shocks. It will also look at the integration of supply chains.  The third phase will look at wider ecosystem trade issues and will assess trends and developments relevant to trade in Services (as opposed to manufactured products), between both jurisdictions.</td></tr><tr><td>**Financial impact of Brexit on consumers in Ireland</td><td>Analysis of impacts on Irish consumers due to price changes on UK imports under a number of potential post Brexit trade scenarios</td></tr></table>* Project being carried out by InterTrade Ireland in consultation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation</p><p>** Project being carried out by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in consultation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation</p></reply>

I understand that the response to Storm Ophelia is being reviewed and a report will be prepared which will be submitted to the Government Taskforce on Emergency Planning for its attention before being submitted for the approval of Government in January 2018.

Commuting to and from a employee&rsquo;s normal assigned place of work, in the employee&rsquo;s own private vehicle or using other modes of transport, is currently outside the scope of the legislation and having consulted with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), there is currently no evidence or proposal to suggest a revision of the legislation to include commuting is required. </p><p>The HSA does focus on Driving for Work and has for many years had a programme in place and they work in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality is seen as a significant growing global market with worldwide revenues for the Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) market set to jump 100 per cent or more over each of the next four years.  According to a new forecast by research firm IDC total spending on such products and services is estimated to be valued at $11.4 billion this year and expected to increase to nearly $215 billion by 2021, achieving a compound annual growth rate of 113.2 per cent along the way.</p>  <p>  As part of the evidence base for the Refresh of Priority Areas under Research Prioritisation Data Visualisation Technologies, and in particular, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) were identified as technologies that are critical to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development out to 2035.</p>  <p>  AR/VR has a wide range applications across key sectors of the economy ranging from leisure and entertainment; product development and manufacturing; retail; to health and education service delivery systems.</p>  <p>  AR/VR is a new disruptive technology impacting on many verticals and as a result it is difficult to scope the numbers of companies involved and the corresponding employment levels albeit a significant area of opportunity for Ireland.  AR/VR is at a very early stage in Ireland with currently 3 multinational companies in the pure play AR/VR with many other MNCs having significant involvement in AR/VR and estimated to employ in the region of 10,000.  There is also a mixture of High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) and more established indigenous companies also involved.  The most recent sector brief on Digital Content Creation (Games, Animation and Film) provides an indication of the potential scale of AR/VR particularly in the gaming sector which is increasingly focussing on AR/VR.  It is estimated that there are ca. 2,000 employees in the gaming sector across 30 agency-supported companies. </p></reply>

It is important to understand what factors led to such mistakes being made and we must take appropriate steps to address these shortcomings and ensure that they are never repeated. </p>  <p>  In view of this, while I cannot publish the Report itself, I intend to publish an account of the investigative failures identified by Judge Alymer and the steps that are being taken to address them.  These include ongoing reform within the ODCE and the establishment, as announced by Government earlier this month, of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as a new independent company law enforcement agency, to provide greater autonomy to the agency and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  Work on the drafting of the necessary General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to this decision has commenced.</p></reply>

This is referred to as consanguinity relief.

Ireland was only the second country in the world to undertake such an analysis.  The Spillover Analysis was published on Budget Day in October 2015. </p>  <p>  The statistical analysis identified very limited flows of capital and trade between Ireland and developing countries, indicating a small likelihood of spillovers from the Irish tax system.  Limited flows make it difficult to draw firm conclusions, but there are some indications that Ireland&rsquo;s treaties with developing countries may have the potential to increase trade flows, possibly in particular in trade of differentiated goods where treaty provisions can enhance the alignment of tax rules. </p>  <p>  The analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s double tax agreement network looked at a range of treaty provisions and compared Ireland&rsquo;s treaties to other treaties concluded by those developing countries.  The analysis was broadly positive in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s treaty network with developing countries.  Some points of concern in relation to two older treaties were noted, but new treaties with these countries have already been agreed and ratified.  </p>  <p>  The review of domestic tax legislation examined provisions relevant to multi-national trade such as withholding taxes, and the influence of multi-lateral agreements such as EU Directives on these provisions.  The outcomes of this analysis were again broadly positive, and it also noted the work ongoing internationally to update the anti-abuse provisions in multi-lateral agreements.</p>  <p>  While there is a regular review of Ireland&rsquo;s International Tax Strategy, there are no immediate plans to repeat the spillover analysis.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that earlier this year, Ireland signed up to the Addis Tax Initative which commits us to doubling our aid spending on tax and development initatives by 2020. </p></reply>

Decisions taken by the bank in this regard are matters for the board and management of the institution.  The Minister for Finance must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to protect the value of the bank as an asset to the State.  A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the bank.  This Framework was published on 30 March 2012 and is available at: <i></i>.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, it is imperative that the bank is fully compliant with all regulatory requirements, including CCMA and measures put in place for consumer protection.  I note, in this regard, the following reply which the Central Bank has provided in response to the Deputy's question:</p><p>&ldquo;The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA) sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  The CCMA applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his/her primary residence.  The CCMA  contains specific protections in respect of tracker mortgages.  A lender cannot require a borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, as part of any alternative repayment arrangement offered to the borrower, except in specific circumstances. </p><p>&ldquo;If the lender has considered the available alternative repayment options and concluded that none of the options that would allow the borrower to retain his or her tracker interest rate are appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, the lender may offer the borrower an alternative repayment arrangement which requires the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type. </p><p>&ldquo;This can only be done if the alternative repayment arrangement: </p><p>a) is affordable for the borrower,<b></b>and </p><p>b) is a long-term sustainable solution which is consistent with Central Bank of Ireland policy on sustainability.&rdquo; </p></reply>

These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p><p>As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning.  </p><p>Department of Finance contingency work is ongoing and continues to examine all possible scenarios and challenges, and is a key input into the whole of Government approach.  The Department has been assessing and preparing for the impact of Brexit since well before the UK referendum in June 2016, with this work now intensified.  The Department's macro-economic forecasts have been updated on a number of occasions in order to take into account the economic impacts of Brexit.  In addition, the Department has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of Brexit-related studies, both before and since the UK's referendum decision, including:</p><p>- :'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland' &ndash; Scoping study of scenarios for the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in November 2015;</p><p>- &lsquo;An Exposure Analysis of Sectors of the Irish Economy&rsquo;.  An in-depth analysis of the possible sectoral and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published by Department of Finance<b></b>October 2016 (Updated March 2017);</p><p>- 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' - Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI  research programme in November 2016, which modelled the medium to long term macroeconomic impact of Brexit under a number of scenarios, including a hard Brexit whereby trade between the EU and UK reverts to WTO tariffs, and;</p><p>- &lsquo;Trade Exposures of Sectors of the Irish Economy in a European Context&rsquo; &ndash; An analysis of trade exposure to the UK in comparison to other EU Member States, published by Department of Finance September 2017.</p><p>It is clear from the Department's own published research that the potential impact on the Irish economy is significant.  The medium to long term economic impacts of a &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; with reversion to the WTO trade rules are set out in the November 2016 study referenced above.  Looking at the effect ten years after a UK exit, a hard Brexit scenario results in the level of GDP being almost 4% below what it otherwise might have been in a no Brexit scenario.</p><p>The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  </p><p>The Government has taken a number of important steps to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs, our Trade and Investment Strategy and the preparation of a new 10-year Capital Plan.  On the fiscal side, the Government has continued its policy focus of enhancing the resilience of our public finances to any Brexit-related shock.  Specifically, it is projected that Ireland will achieve its medium-term budgetary objective of a balanced budget next year. Linked to this, over the forecast horizon, it is projected that the General Government Debt-to-GDP ratio will continue on a downward trajectory, reaching the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) 60 per cent threshold in the early part of the next decade and continuing to improve thereafter.  Whilst not complacent to potential challenges, including our currently elevated debt level, these developments will help provide fiscal capacity in the event of Brexit.  Complementing this, Budget 2018 further established the &lsquo;Rainy Day Fund&rsquo;, which provides a further counter-cyclical buffer, and represents an important measure to strengthen the shock absorption capacity of the national finances to such external risks. </p><p>Budget 2018 also announced further measures to prepare Ireland&rsquo;s economy for the significant challenges ahead.  These measures include: a doubling of capital investment between 2015 to 2021 - boosting the growth potential of the economy;  improving the competitiveness of our personal tax system - through income tax reform; introducing a Key Employment Engagement Programme (KEEP) &ndash; a new incentive to attract key employees; a new &euro;300 million Loan Guarantee Scheme for Brexit-impacted business and a complementary &euro;25 million Agriculture Brexit Loan Scheme &ndash; targeted at enhancing the competitiveness of the businesses most exposed to Brexit; the retention of the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector &ndash; to reduce the impact of currency volatility in the wake of the UK&rsquo;s decision; and a the doubling of additional Brexit-related staff in state agencies. </p><p>The Department of Finance will continue to monitor the economic impacts of Brexit, to carry out relevant analysis and contingency planning and  and to frame budgetary policy advice in this context. </p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  While there is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for pensioners under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions. </p>  <p>  The inter-departmental Group considered the provision of deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship.  As a general principle, eligibility for deferral should be based on gross income.  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) accordingly provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.  These deferral arrangements also take account of mortgage interest payments made by the property owner. </p>  <p>  The property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person and his or her gross income must be below certain thresholds.  The thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple.  Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  </p>  <p>  Following his 2015 review of LPT, Dr Don Thornhill recommended that the deferral options should continue to apply and that the relevant income thresholds be revised periodically in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Dr Thornhill also recommended that for owner-occupiers aged 80 years or over and also for those with stated certified long term illnesses and disabilities who are living alone, that consideration be given to raising the eligible income limit for deferrals to &euro;20,000.  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of this and other recommendations made by Dr Thornhill in due course.</p>  <p>  I have no current plans to introduce an exemption along the lines proposed by the deputy.</p></reply>

This measure extends the relief, which would otherwise have ceased completely at the end of 2017, to provide for 75% of the current relief to continue into 2018, 50% of the current relief into 2019 and 25% of the current relief into 2020.</p>  <p>  The process of phasing out Mortgage Interest Relief for homeowners has been under way since 2009.  Relief has expired for qualifying mortgages taken out prior to 2004 and the relief was abolished for new borrowings taken out after 31 December 2012.  Therefore only qualifying borrowings taken out between 2004 and 2012 remain in receipt of the relief.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the financial pressures that individuals continue to face and of the fact that, without any action in this Finance Bill, the remaining recipients MIR would have faced a &lsquo;cliff&rsquo; where their relief would have ceased entirely in January 2018.  This extension allows for a gradual tapered withdrawal of the relief, running between January of 2018 and December of 2020, to allow the remaining recipients a phased period of adjustment to the cessation of the relief.  In designing the taper, my Department sought to put in place a mechanism which aimed to provide a smooth withdrawal of the relief over time as well as one which was horizontally equitable.  The operation of the measure will be kept under review in conjunction with Revenue.</p>  <p>  It must be remembered that this relief has ceased for homeowners who purchased before 2004, and that that those who purchased their homes from 2013 on have never benefited from the relief.  This tapered extension of the relief strikes an appropriate balance between supporting those current recipients and also considering fairness to homeowners who have never benefited from the relief. </p></reply>

Furthermore, the Irish Credit Bureau does not fall under the regulatory remit of the Central Bank of Ireland.  The stated objectives of private companies are a matter for the companies themselves. </p><p>However, the Deputy may wish to note that the Government gave a commitment as part of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland to develop a legal framework that would facilitate the collection and centralisation of financial information on loans.  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 was framed from the recommendations of the Report of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Credit Histories, which recommended the establishment of a central credit register to resolve weaknesses identified in various reports published subsequent to the banking crisis.  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 provides for the establishment of a Central Credit Register, a new centralised system for collecting, on a mandatory basis, specified personal and credit information on loans and other credit agreements and which will be operated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Register will collect and hold information on loans valued at &euro;500 or higher. Lenders will be required to check the Register when considering credit applications for &euro;2,000 or more.</p><p>The Central Credit Register is being implemented on a phased basis with phase 1 focusing on the submission of information on consumer loans.  Phase 1 commenced on 30 June 2017 and lenders must have completed the submission of Phase 1 data by 31 December 2017, backdated to 30 June 2017.  </p><p>Phase 2 focuses on submission of information from licensed moneylenders, local authorities and business loans and is scheduled to commence on 31 March 2018.  Subject to data quality assurance, it is anticipated that credit reports will be available for lenders and borrowers in 2018. </p><p>Once operational the Central Credit Register will:</p><p>- Provide lenders with information on a borrower's existing credit position to aid their assessment of a borrowers&rsquo; creditworthiness</p><p>- Equip borrowers with information on their financial profile</p><p>- Give the Central Bank better insight into financial markets and support several functions such as prudential supervision, statistics, and financial stability.</p><p>Under the Act, borrowers have the following rights:</p><p>- Request their credit report for information on the central credit register in respect of them</p><p>- Insert an explanatory statement on their credit report</p><p>- Apply to have information amended</p><p>- Report and be informed of suspected impersonation</p><p>Lenders may only request a borrower's credit report when a borrower has:</p><p>- Made an application for a new loan</p><p>- Applied to have an existing loan restructured</p><p>- Arrears on an existing loan or breached the limit on a credit card or overdraft. </p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector for private and commercial vehicles has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan. </p>  <p>  These recommendations were formulated to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs, whilst taking account of the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  This stability aspect is important, as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation again where particular firms drive prices down to a level that is unsustainable and which ultimately results in insolvency.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The third such update was published on the Department's website on 23 October 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations. </p>  <p>  32 actions were due for completion in the first three quarters of the year in total and 29 of those actions have been completed to date.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  The fourth quarterly update should be published early in the New Year and will focus on the 14 actions which are due for completion in the final quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>  I believe that the ongoing implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in addition to the implementation of the Working Group's forthcoming report on employer and public liability insurance, will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12 or so months.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for October) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 15.2% from the peak in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high level of last year.</p></reply>

This equates to a daily rate of 0.0274%.  The 10% rate came into effect on 1 July 2009 as provided for by the Finance Act 2009.  Prior to 1 July 2009 the rate was 12% per annum, which equated to a daily rate of 0.0322%.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s additional information, the current rate of statutory interest charged in respect of late payment of Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisition Tax, Local Property Tax and Stamp Duty liabilities is 8% per annum (0.0219% per day). </p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide an EU or OECD tabular breakdown in the manner requested by the Deputy because the systems operating across the various jurisdictions are not directly comparable.  For example, some jurisdictions apply surcharges and penalties in addition to interest charges while others apply different rates for different taxes and for different periods of default. </p>  <p>  In regard to the United Kingdom, the statutory interest rate in respect of late payments of tax is 3% Additional surcharges are also applied on a scaled basis depending on the level and frequency of default.</p></reply>

Where tax evasion is uncovered Revenue will seek to have the maximum sanctions applied up to and including criminal prosecutions. </p>  <p>  If instances of aggressive tax avoidance emerge, all such instances will be rigorously investigated and challenged by Revenue.  Where anti-avoidance legislation can be applied to recover tax avoided through the use of unacceptable tax avoidance practices and schemes,  Revenue will seek to apply such legislation with a view to recovering any Irish tax avoided together with all associated interest and tax avoidance surcharges.   </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s work in the area of identifying offshore tax evasion has been, and continues to be, a priority.  The international environment has changed significantly in the years since Revenue started to investigate offshore bank accounts and other offshore assets. Tax authorities worldwide now cooperate on a much wider and more intensive basis in investigating those who hide their profits or gains offshore than they did in the past.  Initiatives such as FATCA (an Inter-Governmental agreement to share financial account information with the United States), DAC (EU Directives on Administrative Cooperation), and CRS (the OECD&rsquo;s Common Reporting Standard) are all now helping to ensure that tax administrations have greater access to information in respect of offshore assets and income of their residents.  Revenue will make full use of information received from other jurisdictions under these new initiatives on offshore assets to identify and pursue those who have attempted to use offshore accounts, structures or assets to evade or avoid their tax obligations.</p>  <p>  In the context of these new information sharing initiatives now becoming available, the Government introduced specific measures in the Finance Act 2016 to ensure that, as and from May 2017, tax defaulters whose default relates to offshore matters are unable to avail of the benefits of the voluntary disclosure regime.  Anyone who did not come forward by 4 May 2017 to regularise his or her tax affairs now faces the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible criminal prosecution.</p>  <p>  Revenue will also work in close cooperation with other tax administrations, in the framework of the OECD&rsquo;s Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Cooperation, in addressing issues raised by the &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; papers, and will, as appropriate share information with these other tax administrations under existing legal frameworks.</p>  <p>  In the context of the construction sector, I am advised by Revenue that it has run a national programme to monitor risks and compliance levels in this sector since 2015 and this will continue to be a priority in 2018.  Revenue&rsquo;s interventions in the construction sector, as in all other sectors, are risk focussed and driven by the taxpayer&rsquo;s compliance behaviour, data Revenue has on its records and a variety of data from third parties, including the new international initiatives referred to above, and publicly available sources.  In 2016, for example, compliance interventions in the construction sector yielded an additional &euro;54.73 million in tax, interest and penalties. </p></reply>

A double taxation treaty between both countries provides for tax relief where a particular asset, such as property, that is included in an inheritance is taxed in both countries.  The relief operates by granting a credit against any Irish tax due in the amount of UK tax paid respect of the asset in question. </p>  <p>  The date on which inheritance tax falls due is determined by the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; on which the market value of the assets and property included in an inheritance is established.  Where this date is between 1 January and 31 August, inheritance tax must be paid by 31 October in the same year.  Where this date is between 1 September and 31 December, inheritance must be paid by 31 October in the following year.</p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 contains the rules for determining the valuation date.  The valuation date depends on the particular circumstances of a case and is not a fixed date in relation to all inheritances.  It can be the date on which the assets and property included in an inheritance are given to a beneficiary or such earlier date on which the executors of the will become entitled to retain the assets or property for the benefit of a beneficiary.  Generally the executors are entitled to retain the property for the benefit of the beneficiary on the date on which probate or administration is granted.  Where there is delay in completing the administration of the estate after that date it may happen that inheritance tax falls due for payment before that administration is complete.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the valuation date depends on the particular facts and circumstances of an inheritance and the administration of a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.  If a beneficiary who is resident in the State is uncertain about the appropriate valuation date to use in relation to the payment of a potential inheritance tax liability, the beneficiary may wish to contact his or her local tax office.

Rental profits arising in a REIT are exempt from Corporation Tax, provided the REIT distributes at least 85% of its annual rental profits.  Profits from any other activities within a REIT are subject to corporation tax in the normal way.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that while a REIT must distribute 85% of its annual rental profits, the Companies Acts set out the amount of profits that a REIT has available for distribution. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Companies Acts, and taking a REIT which only has rental profit for simplicity: the profits available for distribution by the REIT would be the rental income of the REIT less all expenses of the REIT (including but not limited to local property tax (LPT), remuneration including bonuses and asset manager fees).  It is important to note that a REIT does not get a tax deduction for LPT.  In calculating the amount of a dividend a REIT is able to pay, the LPT gets deducted along with other expenses paid.  This in turn reduces the amount of dividends a REIT can pay.  The expenses come out of the profits, therefore, the profits available for distribution are the profits after deducting all expenses incurred.  The investors are then taxed on the profits as distributed.</p></reply>

As part of this brief, the OGCIO works with other Departments and the EU to produce policies, strategies and systems that provide cross-cutting improvements to how public administration is carried out via the use of ICT.  As an example, the OGCIO played the primary administrative role in formulating the Public Service ICT strategy, which Government published in January 2015.  Regarding the strategy your question refers to, the OGCIO also had the primary role in formulating the eGovernment Strategy 2017 to 2020.  </p>  <p>  In regards to the implementation of Public Service-wide ICT strategies, it should be noted that each Department is individually responsible and accountable for how it uses ICT in the carrying out of its administrative functions, although the OGCIO does have oversight of the more strategic projects.  The eGovernment Strategy sets out a broad set of visioning principles that generally fall to all Departments to implement and adhere to.  The Strategy sets out a number of complementary actions, which fall to different, or multiple, Departments to carry forward.  For example, the sections regarding eHealth, eID, backend reform, business and location identifiers, the development of ICT skills and capacity, etc., rest with different implementing Departments.  To this end, the eGovernment Strategy sets out a common vision, where its implementation is collectively and individually progressed as appropriate.</p></reply>

The last annual census undertaken was for the year ended 31 December 2016 and this noted some 64,000 persons were enrolled as members of the Single Scheme at that time.  This number includes significant numbers of temporary staff, not all of whom would have remained in post subsequent to 31 December 2016.  A breakdown of total membership advised by relevant authorities to my Department at 31 December 2016 is outlined in the table.</p><p>The Single Scheme is administered principally at workplace level by each individual public service body (termed a relevant authority) to which the Scheme applies.  The discharging of key member-facing responsibilities, including the issue of annual benefit statements, rests with each relevant authority under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012</p><p>The Scheme is of course subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department, as is the operation of the 2012 Act more generally.  Recognising the complexities involved in this career-average Scheme, a Single Scheme Administration Project unit was established within my Department in 2016.  A range of actions are in train to support more effective operation of the Scheme by all relevant authorities.</p><p>In relation to actuarial considerations, Section 41 of the 2012 Act provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can initiate an actuarial review of the Scheme.  I have no immediate plans for the carrying out of such a review, bearing in mind in particular that the Single Scheme is in place for less than five years, which is a relatively short time in pension terms.</p><p>Following an analysis in early 2017 of overall public service pension entitlements by the Public Service Pay Commission, and in recognition of the more moderately scaled career-average based pension benefits in prospect for Single Scheme members, the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 proposed that the Additional Superannuation Contribution (ASC) to be applied in place at the of the Pension-Related Deduction (PRD) for public servants, should be set at a lower level for Single Scheme members.  The Public Service Pay &amp;amp; Pensions Bill 2017 sets out the lower percentage rates of ASC that will apply to members of the Single Scheme from 1 January 2019 compared to members of other public service pension schemes, with a further reduction for these members provided for under this Bill from 1 January 2020.</p><p><b>Single Public Service Pension

Subject to certain conditions, they provide for the granting of added years in cases where the minimum essential requirements of a competition are such that they would prohibit a candidate from entering the civil/public service in sufficient time to acquire maximum service and, by extension, the candidate would be unable to accrue maximum superannuation benefits.</p>  <p>  - Ill-Health/Death in Service: Added years may be granted in the Civil and Public Service in cases of retirement on the grounds of ill-health or where a Survivor's pension is being awarded in circumstances where the civil or public servant dies while still in service.</p>  <p>  - Section 6 of the Superannuation Act 1909 and Sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 set out rules governing the early retirement of Civil Servants as a result of abolition of office or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in order to effect greater efficiency and economy in the organisation of a Department.  Section 6 of the 1963 Act provides for the granting of added years. (These provisions may apply to Secretaries General at the end of their contracts; similar provisions apply to City &amp;amp; County Managers under the Local Government Superannuation Scheme.  These arrangements were restricted by the Government in 2011.).  In the wider Public Service these provisions serve as guidelines in dealing with similar cases.</p>  <p>  - Chief Executive Officers of Non-Commercial State Sponsored Bodies may, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, be granted added years at the end of their contract.</p>  <p>  As regards the detailed information sought, it should be noted that, once a pension is calculated and comes into payment, a breakdown of the various service components upon which that pension is based is not retained centrally nor readily available.  It would take an inordinate amount of official time and effort to obtain the information as it would necessitate examination of the files of all retirees in the period concerned.</p></reply>

Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through a range of cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government's contingency planning.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure has responsibility for a number of EU issues which will be impacted by Brexit, most notably our EU-funded cross-border programmes with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and also issues relating to public procurement.  Through its Brexit Unit it is actively contributing to the contingency planning for a range of scenarios that is underway led by the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade.</p></reply>

There is no specific provision in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 which established the Single Scheme, to provide for the augmentation of pension benefits by individual members of the Single Scheme.  Notwithstanding this, a commitment has been given that a facility for the purchase and transfer of additional pension benefits by Single Scheme members would be provided by way of Regulations under the Single Scheme Act.</p>  <p>  Appropriate Regulations are being drafted and these will set out the rules of the new scheme.  Consistent with the structure of the Single Scheme, it is intended  that the Regulations will allow Single Scheme members to purchase additional pension and lump sum referable amounts to augment pension benefits accrued under the Scheme.  The Regulations are also expected to provide for the transfer of pension entitlements accrued in certain other Revenue approved pension schemes to the Single Scheme.  The pricing of purchased benefits will be based on the actuarially calculated cost of paying out those benefits at retirement and will operate on a cost neutral basis to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  The draft scheme is currently subject to detailed legal and other considerations and the intention is to bring forward Regulations on the new scheme as soon as these considerations are complete.</p>  <p>  I should also highlight that it is open to any member of the Single Scheme to consider other pension investment products that are available in the market in order to enhance their pension provision.  That is a matter for individual public servants.</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  Seven Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) have been identified in County Louth as follows: Baltray, Annagassan, Ardee, Dundalk &amp;amp; Blackrock South, Carlingford &amp;amp; Greenore, Termonfeckin and Drogheda.  The feasible measures both structural and non-structural identified for these AFAs are contained in the final plans for the East and North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann CFRAM studies. </p>  <p>  These final Plans are currently undergoing an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, I would hope by the end of this year to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the 29 Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.  Thereafter, I would hope to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those Plans that will, over the coming years, be taken to detailed design to protect those communities at assessed risk.</p>  <p>  Louth County Council has undertaken a number of flood relief works with funding approved by the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  These include flood relief projects at Rampark, Lordship and Baltray.  The coastal flood relief scheme at Bellurgan is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2018. </p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being supported by cross-Departmental coordination structures through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK.  </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios, including a hard Brexit.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning framework, to which my own Department contributed fully on the preparation of the education components.  </p>  <p>  Our work has been facilitated by the International Unit of my Department which, under the leadership of a Deputy Secretary General, has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating our response to Brexit.  In discharging its Brexit-related functions, the International Unit participates in the Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group which oversees the coordination of the Government&rsquo;s response to the outcome of the UK referendum, and supports the Cabinet Committee on the European Union including Brexit.  This is further underpinned by the Unit's active engagement with other Departments in Brexit Workgroups on Brexit Coordination; the Economy and Sectoral Issues; the Common Travel Area; and the Island of Ireland Working Group. </p>  <p>  The Unit also chairs the Education and Research Subgroup under the Economy and Sectoral Issues strand of co-ordination.  The Subgroup includes relevant areas within the Department and relevant Agencies of the Department and other Departments/Agencies.  Meetings of the Education and Research Subgroup of the Economy and Trade Group took place on 28 October 2016, 15 February; 24 May and 9 October 2017 and most recently focused on stakeholder consultations input and research collaboration.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Higher Education Authority in Brexit planning for the higher education sector.  The HEA has published a Brexit issues paper and has held meetings with the HEIs to discuss ongoing planning and issues with them as the process develops.  We will continue to engage in this important aspect of planning and research work.</p>  <p>  It is my priority to continue to engage actively on a number of fronts in dealing with the impact of Brexit on the Education sector.  Consultation has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit.  We have consulted extensively with our stakeholders. Between December 2016 and January 2017 both I and Minister of State Halligan have led consultations with stakeholders from right across the higher education, further education and training; and primary and post-primary education sectors.  More recently, on 3 July 2017, the T&aacute;naiste, and Minister for Enterprise and Innovation Frances Fitzgerald TD, and I co-hosted a joint stakeholder dialogue on enterprise skills needs and Brexit.  The outputs from these events have been made publicly available.  A further joint stakeholder dialogue on research and innovation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is due to take place on 5th December 2017.  </p>  <p>  All risks and challenges are being factored in to my Department&rsquo;s overall approach to future discussions and negotiations and our input to Government's preparations for EU-UK negotiations including the finalisation of our sectoral response plan.  Both I and my Department will continue to consult with the sector interests as necessary through the period ahead.</p>  <p>  I have attached particular importance to engagement at political and institutional level on our Brexit agenda.  I have met counterparts Peter Weir and Simon Hamilton of the NI Executive, and the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Education, Justine Greening.  Meetings were also held with the former Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Keir Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain.  Meetings have also taken place with Ministers from other EU Member States and with representatives of the EU Commission including Commissioner Navracsics.</p>  <p>  All of this work is ongoing and must also respond to the emerging developments in the Brexit negotiations.  My Department will work to ensure appropriate timely inputs to the current negotiations including the work of the Barnier taskforce.  To that end we will keep under review the need for research and analysis of specific areas or issues that can inform these inputs.</p>  <p>  There may also be opportunities to increase the numbers of international students choosing Ireland in the wake of Brexit and this is factored into the implementation work underway led by my Department, working with the sector, in the delivery of the actions in the International Education Strategy 2016-2020.</p>  <p>  I will keep under review the necessity for further allocations of funds as circumstances develop.</p></reply>

The specifications provide for the sustained development of students&rsquo; oral language competence (spoken production and spoken interaction) throughout the three years of junior cycle.  </p>  <p>  The assessment of student&rsquo; oral language skills at Junior Cycle is incorporated into the two Classroom Based Assessments (CBAs) in both Modern Foreign Languages and Gaeilge.  This is reflective of the emphasis placed on the development of students&rsquo; oral language competence in the specifications.  Both CBAs provide opportunities to assess students&rsquo; oral production and spoken interaction skills.  </p>  <p>  In the MFL specification, the first CBA, completed during their second year, involves students demonstrating their oral skills through a production or interaction.  The second CBA, completed during students' third year of junior cycle, is the creation of a Language Portfolio.  Throughout their junior cycle studies, students engage with and reflect on their language learning and develop and document their sociocultural awareness.  The students choose three pieces of work from their compilation to submit for assessment.  </p>  <p>  For Gaeilge, CBA 1, carried out in second year, requires the completion of a portfolio in which one piece of text will be a sound/video piece.  CBA 2, carried out in third year, is based entirely on students&rsquo; oral language competence, including spoken interaction.  </p>  <p>  With these changes, the assessment of oral language skills in Junior Cycle Modern Foreign Languages and Gaeilge will no longer be optional.</p></reply>

Kildare, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that the SENO and Senior SENO for the Kildare area have met with parents of the students who are due to leave the primary school referred to by the Deputy, in June 2018, to discuss their concerns and provide information relating to their transition to post primary education.  The NCSE have also advised that they have assured parents that they are aware of their child&rsquo;s departure from primary school and are planning accordingly.  </p>  <p>  The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department and the NCSE has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE has advised the parents involved, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a student, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will continue to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a post primary placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements and special school places can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p></reply>

Roscommon earlier this year.</p>  <p>  My Department has mandated the Education and Training Board (ETB) sector to manage education provision for residents of the EROCs.  In the case of the Ballaghaderreen EROC, Galway Roscommon ETB provides:</p>  <p>  - A transitional primary school programme on-site which introduces children and their families to the Irish education system whilst fostering social and personal development and cultural integration;</p>  <p>  - A transitional post primary education programme, delivered on-site which includes English language tuition is provided for this age-group.     </p>  <p>  These transitional programmes are based around the anticipated resettlement timescale of 3-4 months indicated by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Where families continue to reside in the EROC beyond this period, arrangements can be made, in consultation with Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service, for the transition of school-age children to mainstream education in local schools.  Otherwise these children will begin to attend mainstream school in the location where their family has been resettled.</p>  <p>  The objective of my Department is that all children would have access to the mainstream education system at the earliest possible opportunity.  In the case of children resident in EROC accommodation, this objective must take account of both school readiness of children and the availability of school places.  With regard to the latter, it may be noted that the location of EROCs, including the centre in Ballaghaderreen, is determined by the Department of Justice and Equality based on the availability of suitable premises.  </p>  <p>  Efforts have been made by GRETB to engage with local schools as appropriate, while overall integration with the local community for families in the EROC is overseen by the local Interagency Committee.</p>  <p>  In terms of additional supports for schools, both primary and post-primary schools may avail of additional language supports provided for students who do not speak English as their first language.  English as an Additional Language (EAL) resources are designed to allow individual students to participate in mainstream education on a par with their peers.  These and other learning supports are provided on the basis of identified educational need.  </p>  <p>  All children who present with special educational needs, including those participating in the IRPP, are assessed by the relevant health and education professionals, and are linked with the relevant education provision most suited to their needs.  These supports include learning support, access to special classes in mainstream schools or access, if necessary, to special schools.  </p>  <p>  Overall education provision to persons in the Irish Refugee Protection Programme is overseen by my Department in collaboration with relevant ETBs and the educational Welfare Service of Tusla.  Provision in individual centres, as well as the overall programme is kept under constant review with the overall objective of ensuring the best possible educational outcomes for participating families.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>Schools were not required to apply for assessment in DEIS as every school was automatically assessed as part of the DEIS Identification process.  Therefore no 'appeals' process was required. However, under DEIS Plan 2017, a process to verify the data used was provided for and some schools availed of this verification process.  As with the new DEIS Identification process the verification process was also a scientific exercise which involved checking the school data, as used in the Identification process, in terms of the quality and accuracy of the data supplied and the match rate to CSO small area.  With regard to the number of schools added as a result of this process I can confirm that one extra school has been included in DEIS.  Schools that availed of this process have been notified of the outcome. </p><p>Schools included in DEIS with effect from September 2017 are those whose level of disadvantage has been identified as those schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage among their pupil cohort. Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification model. </p><p>It is important to note that this is the first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS.</p><p>A further process will take account of updated data as it becomes available.  Schools are being advised to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircode which can now be recorded by schools on both POD and PPOD databases.  The HP Index, based on the 2016 National Census data has been published recently. </p><p>The plan is for a further assessment of all schools, using these updated datasets.  Should this exercise reveal that any school, which did not qualify for DEIS in 2017, meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the updated information then additional schools may be included subject to available resources.</p></reply>

Currently, under the terms of the Initiative, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution.  The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course</p>  <p>  The student contribution charge currently stands at &euro;3,000 and applies to all full-time students who benefit under the Free Fees Initiative.  However, it is important to recognise that the State pays this contribution (or part of it) on behalf of approximately 43% of undergraduate students as they qualify on means-tested grounds for exemption from the contribution under the Student Grants Scheme. </p>  <p>  Tax relief provisions are also available so that second and subsequent siblings do not have to bear the full cost of the student contribution.  In addition, higher education institutions have provisions in place to allow students to pay the contribution in at least two moieties. </p>  <p>  Additionally, some students may also be requested by their respective institutions to pay an additional student levy.  The determination of the level and payment of such levies are a matter for the institutions themselves and are not collected centrally by my Department.</p></reply>

This curriculum supports children&rsquo;s language learning in our two languages, Irish and English, through high-quality experiences.  The curriculum aims to ensure that children acquire transferrable language skills which will assist them in learning both Irish and English during their primary education and in additional languages when they choose them at second level. Work is currently underway in developing the Primary Language Curriculum for third to sixth class which will be available to schools in autumn 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department's current focus is on national delivery of the Primary Language Curriculum.  A comprehensive continuing professional development programme is in place to support the implementation of the new Primary Language Curriculum.  Teachers, as part of this professional development, receive advice on the use of different approaches to teach Irish and to use Irish as the medium of instruction across other aspects of the curriculum. This is the CLIL approach.</p>  <p>  The Department's Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022 also supports immersion education and the use of Irish as the language of communication and instruction to assist with the language acquisition of learners of Irish and the language enrichment of native speakers.  In April 2017 the Department issued an invitation to all primary and post-primary schools in Gaeltacht language planning areas to participate in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme.  Schools participating in the Scheme are eligible to access extra supports and resources on the implementation of specified language criteria, including total immersion education through Irish on a phased basis.</p></reply>

These include cases where the Minister becomes aware of a fact or circumstance that would have required or permitted refusal of a passport.  </p>  <p>  Any refusal to issue a passport or decision to cancel and require surrender of a passport must be evidence-based and defensible in the case of legal challenge.

This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  All relevant Departments are providing research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  An important focus of planning and preparation is deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios, including one in which no Withdrawal Agreement is concluded.  This represents an intensification of the Government&lsquo;s previous contingency planning.  All Departments are assessing in a very concrete way the immediate legal or practical consequences of a no-deal Brexit in their areas and what mitigating measures might be possible.  It will then be necessary for the Government to consider the situation in the round and discuss whether specific actions are required at that stage.</p>  <p>  Aside from its wider co-ordination responsibilities, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has lead responsibility for planning for, preparing positions on, and following the EU-UK negotiations.  This requires research on and analysis of very many legal, institutional, and political issues.  The eventual outcome of negotiations will of course be decisive in determining the shape and effects of Brexit.  Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and our Embassies in all Member States, send in a constant stream of reports describing and analysing the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our partners.</p>  <p>  This work is reflected in the Government&rsquo;s policy positions and public statements, such as the comprehensive document on the Government&lsquo;s approach to the Article 50 negotiations and our response to Brexit which was published on 2 May as well as through in depth analysis such as the series of Department of Finance/ESRI research papers on the implications of Brexit.  The Government will continue to consider how best to present further work.  We are also communicating through public consultations and stakeholder engagement, such as the All-Island Civic Dialogue and the Brexit Stakeholder Forum. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Government is already actively responding to the implications of Brexit and putting measures in place to mitigate the adverse effects for Ireland.  We have already taken important steps to prepare the economy, including in Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and the Government&rsquo;s Trade and Investment Strategy. </p>  <p>  Significant measures were announced in Budget 2018 including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Businesses and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  There is also increased funding for Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to support our Brexit related work as well as to support the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025 to help our exporters find new markets and diversity their exports. </p>  <p>  Clearly, a disorderly exit would be very damaging, particularly for Ireland, and Michel Barnier&rsquo;s recent call for EU Member States to plan for such a contingency is fully in line with the Government&rsquo;s approach.  And while we are not at the cliff edge yet, our preparations and contingency planning for such an unwelcomed outcome will continue.  However, our primary focus remains on making the negotiations a success and working with EU partners and UK to ensure an orderly withdrawal that protects the peace process, maintains the Common Travel Area and agrees a transitional arrangement which leads the way to the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-21a.562.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112100073#WRL04300"><p>The attack on a convoy of busses transporting evacuees from the besieged towns of Foua and Kefraya in North West Syria last April, which left over 100 people dead, many of them children, was utterly abhorrent and I condemn it unreservedly.  Attacks on civilians in Syria, such as the bombing of this convoy of evacuees, further underline the need for full accountability for these appalling acts.  Those responsible for such crimes on all sides must be held accountable.  In relation to the allegation of kidnapping raised by the Deputy, it is extremely difficult to get reliable and verified information on the situation in contested areas of Syria.  Reliable evidence is essential for follow up and accountability.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports a broad range of efforts to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria as part of a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict.  We have consistently called for the referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Ireland supports the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry established in August 2011 by the Human Rights Council to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in Syria.  Furthermore, in December, Ireland and a group of likeminded countries successfully pressed for the adoption of a resolution by the UN General Assembly to establish an International Impartial and Independent Mechanism to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria.  Earlier this year my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade announced a contribution of &euro;100,000 to support the work of this mechanism.</p>  <p>  Conflict and war have a particularly horrific impact on vulnerable groups such as children, and Ireland is committed to working to ensure that their needs are taken into account in humanitarian response in a meaningful way.  Ireland has made a significant contribution to the humanitarian response to the Syrian conflict. Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian effort.  This includes over &euro;3.4 million in funding to UNICEF for the No Lost Generation Initiative (NLG), which works to protect children, adolescent and youths from the threat of poverty through the provision of education and protection within Syria and neighbouring countries.  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, from which &euro;445 million was contributed in 2016.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to prioritise the protection of civilians, and particularly the most vulnerable of these, including children, in our response to the Syria crisis.</p></reply>

The number and level of staff, and the time allocated to preparing individual replies depends on the complexity and urgency of the issues raised, the ease of access to the required information, and the degree of cross-Divisional coordination required in preparing the reply.  The cost of answering Parliamentary Questions can vary considerably, therefore, and it would be challenging to isolate the administrative costs associated with the processing of individual Questions.

Therefore, the Government will continue to advocate that the best solution for Northern Ireland is for the UK to remain effectively in a Customs Union and Single Market arrangement.</p>  <p>  If the UK continues to rule out this option, it must present alternative workable solutions that will ensure there is no hard border nor any border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.  Avoiding regulatory divergence will be an important element in this regard.  North/South cooperation is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement.  The EU Commission Taskforce has recognised the central importance of North South Cooperation and states that it should be protected across all relevant sectors.</p>  <p>  Officials have been carrying out detailed work over the last few weeks to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.  There is still more work to be done in this area, but it has underlined the need to avoid risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Single Market and Customs Union.  North South cooperation has made an important contribution, through the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, to the improvement of people's lives on this island.  We want to ensure that this cooperation can continue in a meaningful way.</p>  <p>  The UK has a responsibility to ensure that it does not hinder or impede the continuation and development of North South cooperation by its withdrawal from the EU.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is working closely with the Commission Task Force to advance progress on Irish issues in the negotiations with the UK.

The war has entered into its third year, the political process has stalled, and the fighting is having devastating consequences for civilians, with credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian law.  Yemen is also facing the world's fastest-growing cholera epidemic.</p>  <p>  When EU Foreign Ministers last discussed the situation in Yemen in April, they called on the parties to start negotiating a peace agreement, and committed to increasing its engagement with Yemen once a political solution to the conflict is agreed.  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget.  In addition, Ireland has also contributed over &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance from our own aid programme, since the start of the conflict in 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland takes the issue of humanitarian access extremely seriously.  The closure of land, air and sea ports this month, following a missile attack on Riyadh, was an alarming development, especially given the impact on humanitarian aid.  When my officials last met with officials from the Saudi Embassy in Dublin earlier this month, they condemned the attack on Riyadh, which endangered the lives of civilians.  They also relayed my request that all parties to the conflict do everything possible to facilitate the delivery of aid.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue. </p>  <p>  I note the announcement by Saudi Arabia that it intends to allow the reopening of some ports and border crossings.  This must proceed urgently.  Yemen has no resilience to the suspension of humanitarian assistance, as locally held supplies are extremely limited.  I will continue to monitor the situation closely, and I take this opportunity to reiterate my call on all parties to the conflict to allow unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need.</p>  <p>  The conflict in Yemen has led to grave concerns about human rights, and Ireland has worked in the UN system to address this.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, I decided that Ireland should join a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen.  This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.</p>  <p>  The only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict.  Ireland fully supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement.  Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.</p></reply>

However the UN has reported that many thousands of people remain displaced there and in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.  There are other reports, notably from a range of UN representatives outlining details of serious human rights violations in the area.</p>  <p>  The wide-ranging efforts being made at national, EU and the wider international levels to address this issue have been outlined in my recent responses to questions in this House, most recently on 16 November. </p>  <p>  At a political level, Ireland, and the EU, continue to address this crisis in line with the Conclusions setting out the EU's position on the situation in Myanmar which were adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 October.  Ireland fully endorses this position.</p>  <p>  This week, Minister of State Ciar&aacute;n Cannon T.D.  directly conveyed Ireland's concerns about the situation in Rakhine State to Myanmar's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs' U Kyaw Tin in a bilateral meeting in Nay Pyi Taw.  He raised concerns about the reports of human rights violations and the need to restore humanitarian access to Rakhine State. </p>  <p>  He urged the Government of Myanmar to allow the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of the people that have fled their homes and he welcomed Myanmar's engagement with the Government of Bangladesh to address this issue. </p>  <p>  Minister Cannon urged the Government of Myanmar to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State in full.  In doing so, he emphasised the need to put the conditions in place to enable those returning to Rakhine State to be reintegrated and to ensure their livelihoods. </p>  <p>  On behalf of the EU, High Representative Mogherini, along with a representative group of EU Foreign Ministers met with Myanmar's State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi on 20 November to discuss the situation in Rakhine State.  After the meeting, the High Representative issued a statement on behalf of the EU, Norway and Switzerland, which emphasised that the humanitarian and human rights situation in Rakhine State remains extremely serious and called on the Government to ensure accountability for those responsible for committing atrocities.  Prior to this meeting, HRVP Mogherini visited the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. </p>  <p>  Minister of State Cannon visited Myanmar to participate in a meeting of Asian and European foreign ministers in the ASEM format, which in addition to allowing broader discussions, offered an opportunity for European ministers to express their concern on the situation in Rakhine state.  The Minister of State is also meeting with UN and Non Governmental Organisations to learn at first hand of the work they are doing and the challenges they face.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage at a national level, through our EU membership and with the broader international community to press for a positive and long-term solution to the situation in Rakhine State, including for the Rohingya community, and for the significant number of refugees who are now situated in Bangladesh.</p></reply>

As things unfold, I urge the authorities to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens, and underline the need for all stakeholders to exercise restraint and ensure a peaceful resolution to this situation.</p>  <p>  Over the weekend, there were very large, but peaceful, public demonstrations in Harare and Bulawayo, with the participation of perhaps 100,000 people, urging President Mugabe to step down.  This was followed on Sunday by a special session of the Central Committee of the ruling ZANU-PF party, which formally removed President Mugabe from the position of party president and First Secretary.  The party set a deadline of noon on Monday for his resignation as head of state of Zimbabwe.  That deadline has now been missed.  Signals are that an impeachment process will now begin.  President Mugabe, for his part, has indicated that he will address a ZANU-PF party conference next month.</p>  <p>  I strongly urge all relevant players to work towards an early and peaceful resolution to this situation, with a view to facilitating the return to civilian government.  All those with influence in Zimbabwe should respect democratic and constitutional processes, as well as the rule of law. </p>  <p>  My Department's primary concern is the safety and security of Irish citizens in Zimbabwe.  The Irish Embassy in South Africa, which is accredited to Zimbabwe, is monitoring the situation closely, and is in close contact with the Irish Honorary Consul, the Irish Community in Zimbabwe and our EU partners on the ground. </p>  <p>  The travel advice on my Department's website has been updated to encourage all Irish citizens in the country to remain indoors, to exercise caution, to avoid areas when demonstrations may take place, and to monitor the Department's travel advice regularly.  The Irish Embassy in Pretoria is also providing updates on twitter and its website, and is in regular contact with the Irish Honorary Consul and the EU Delegation in Harare.  It will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>

However, the Irish Government is limited in what it can do in the case of an Irish citizen who is involved in a criminal case overseas.  The Irish Government cannot intervene in a matter that is before the courts in another jurisdiction, just as no foreign Government can interfere in our judicial system.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, both I and my officials have been working very hard on this citizen's behalf.  We have made repeated representations to the authorities in Manila stressing the humanitarian concerns in this case and requesting that the pending appeal against this man's conviction be expedited. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government made a direct request to the Administrator of the Supreme Court to ask that this Appeal be expedited on humanitarian grounds.  In April of this year, the Administrator of the Supreme Court acknowledged the Irish Government's concerns and interest in the matter and instructed that the papers related to the Appeal should be elevated to the Supreme Court for consideration.  </p>  <p>  In July 2017 attorneys acting on behalf of this citizen advised that all relevant papers had been filed in relation to the appeal.  The matter is now with the Supreme Court for resolution.</p>  <p>  Last September while I was attending the UN General Assembly session in New York I personally raised the case directly with the Philippines Foreign Minister, Mr Alan Cayetano.  I underlined the Irish Government's concerns about this situation and asked for Foreign Minister Cayetano's assistance, specifically in relation to our request that the Supreme Court consider the appeal urgently.  Minister Cayetano agreed to follow up on the matter on his return to Manila. </p>  <p>  Most recently this month I followed up with a letter to Foreign Minister, Mr. Cayetano reiterating my serious concerns about this case and in view of the compelling humanitarian consideration in this case.</p>  <p>  The Irish Ambassador to The Philippines has also, on my instruction, raised the case again at senior official level in recent weeks with the Philippines Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government's Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

It should be obvious to the House that it would have been wholly inappropriate for my predecessor or my Department to seek to influence in any way the Garda Commissioner's instructions or to have direct contact with her legal team.</p>  <p>  In particular there is no question of my Department having any say in what witnesses would be called before the Commission of Investigation.  Consequently there can be no question of my Department being asked to, or offering, advice or approval for the Commissioner's approach to the Commission of Investigation.</p>  <p>  I can assure Deputies, that there is no question of my Department having had prior knowledge of any legal strategy adopted by the Garda Commissioner at the Commission of Investigation.</p>  <p>  My Department has clarified that my predecessor was made aware in May 2015, after the event, of an issue having been raised at the Commission of Investigation.  However, as also previously stated, neither my predecessor nor my Department was aware of certain issues which arose at the Commission of Investigation until the matter entered the public domain almost a year later.</p>  <p>  I should mention that in May 2016 the Garda Commissioner wrote to the Department referring to the public concerns arising from the media reports in question.  The Commissioner requested that matters arising from the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation pertaining to a 2008 meeting in Mullingar be referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) for investigation.  On 16 June 2016 the former Minister referred the matter to GSOC for investigation under Section 102(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act (as amended).  GSOC's investigation into this matter is on-going.  </p>  <p>  My Department has, today, written to the Disclosures Tribunal in relation to the manner in which, in May 2015, my Department was made aware that an issue had been raised at the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation.  It will be for the Tribunal to decide on what action, if any, it should take in relation to the matter and, as a result, I do not propose to comment further on it.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  In addition, as you will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise.  For this reason, the number of Garda available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division. </p>  <p>  The Edgeworthstown Garda Station forms part of the Granard District in the Roscommon/Longford Division.  I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division on the 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 305, of which 46 members were assigned to Granard District and 11 to Edgeworthstown Station.  There are also 9 Garda Reserves and 28 Civilians attached to the Roscommon/Longford Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Response Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 10 of whom have been assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Roscommon/Longford Division, in the coming years.</p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government's wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government's analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government's contingency planning.  </p>  <p>  Within my own Department, analysis and research on the possible impacts of the UK departure from the EU commenced in early 2016.  A Working Group of senior officials was established to manage the Department's response and to carry out a risk analysis of the UK's potential departure, taking into account engagement with relevant justice sector agencies and other stakeholders.

However, while an EU Regulation of this kind is normally a directly-applicable legal instrument and does not therefore require any national law to give it effect, the GDPR contains a number of provisions which allow Member States a limited margin of flexibility.  An accompanying Directive, which sets data protection standards for the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties will also enter into force in May 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government published the General Scheme of the Data Protection Bill in May last.  The Bill will give further effect to the GDPR in areas in which flexibility is allowed, transpose the law enforcement Directive into national law and replace the Data Protection Commissioner with a Data Protection Commission.</p>  <p>  The Bill is currently being drafted and will be published during the current Dail term with a view to enactment in Spring 2018.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 10 of whom have been assigned to the Togher District.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cork City Division and Togher District, in the coming years.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy as provided by the Commissioner is set out in the following table.</p><p>Strength of Community Garda&iacute; by Station in Togher Garda District 30 September 2017<table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Bishopstown</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Carrigaline</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Crosshaven</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Douglas </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Passage   West</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Togher</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

The publication of the strategy was welcomed by UNCAT in its concluding observations on the second periodic report of Ireland.  The second National Strategy is a whole of Government response to such violence.  The strategy&rsquo;s timebound actions are structured around three high level goals, the first of which is concerned with raising awareness, education and training.</p>  <p>  There are a number of actions in the strategy relating to training.  The UNCAT recommendations contained in its concluding observations underlines the importance of the full implementation of these actions.  Action 1.500 commits public sector agencies working in the area of domestic and gender-based violence - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service, the Probation Service, Tusla and the HSE - to develop and deliver training to staff dealing with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Action 1.600 commits Tusla to develop strategic approaches to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence training within Tusla.  Under Action 1.700, Cosc &ndash; the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence -  has liaised with the Committee for Judicial Studies to raise awareness among the judiciary.  The previous Chief Justice advised my predecessor that the judiciary are very aware of the needs of victims, and have received training or information in the area of the rights, support and protection of a range of victims of crime, and anticipated further seminars and conferences for the judiciary on these issues.  Action 1.800 commits the Law Society, the Bar Council and King&rsquo;s Inns to develop and deliver initial training and developmental training for continual delivery to legal practitioners.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is independent in the exercise of her statutory functions.  I have been informed that since July 2015 all domestic violence files submitted to the DPP by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been fully collated to allow for a holistic analysis of offences.  This analysis has underpinned training of prosecutors &ndash; both decision makers in the DPP's office and lawyers prosecuting cases in the District Court in Dublin.  I am also advised that, coinciding with the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, presentations were delivered to prosecutors, including State solicitors, by the Head of Prosecutions and the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the actions in the Strategy are subject to formal monitoring twice yearly by a monitoring committee comprising of non-governmental agencies and state organisations.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Donegal Division on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 389.  There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 32 civilians attached to the Division.  On the 1 January 2017 the strength of the Donegal Division was 381 with 21 Garda reserves and 32 Civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Response Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 24 of whom have been assigned to the Donegal Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Donegal Division, in the coming years.</p></reply>

In October 2015, INIS civilian staff took over the front-line immigration controls in the Transit Area of Terminal 2.  On 2nd October 2017, responsibility for these controls in Terminal 2 was handed over from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS, thus completing the transfer of frontline passport checks at Dublin Airport to civilian staff.</p>  <p>  In relation to expanding the civilianisation programme to other ports of entry, my Department will consider deploying civilian officers to other major ports of entry to the State where this makes sense from a cost and efficiency perspective.  In circumstances where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will maintain a presence at our ports to continue their crucial policing role in protecting our borders from a security and enforcement perspective, one of the requirements of further civilianisation at other ports of entry will be to achieve the right balance between Garda&iacute; and civilian staff. In this light, the nature and volume and time distribution of passenger traffic at other ports of entry will be a determining factor in any decision to deploy civilian immigration officers.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Donegal Division on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 389 with 18 Garda Reserves and 32 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 24 of whom were assigned to the Donegal Division.  I am also informed that a further 200 hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow the deployment of increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division including the Donegal Division in the coming years. </p><p>The Deputy will  appreciate I have no direct role in Garda strategies to tackle  anti-social behaviour and criminal activity.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that I am in regular contact with the Commissioner about all aspects of policing and community safety with a view to  ensuring that our cities and towns are safe for all.  <b></b></p><p>More generally, there are a range of  strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  The powers available to Garda&iacute; support them in addressing anti-social behaviours,  including the prevention of nuisance or annoyance to others and forestalling  damage to property or a breach of the peace. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to tackling public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety.  The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities, businesses and other stakeholders to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.</p><p>Furthermore, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in Community Policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  Community Policing Teams will be  made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the D.M.R.

However, I can advise the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner established a new Garda Special Crime Task Force in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2016, under the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, to augment the response to organised crime at a local level through concentrated policing, and through a multi-agency approach to targeting the proceeds of crime.  The Deputy will be aware that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the allocation of Garda resources and I, as Minister, have no direct role in such matters.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda operational responses to gang-related crime in Dublin are coordinated under Operation Hybrid.  As of 31 October 2017, there have been 71 arrests in relation to gang-related killings, with 8 persons charged in connection with those murders and a further 3 persons charged with related offences.  In addition, 30 firearms have been seized and over 14,260 lines of enquiry conducted.  In excess of 44,490 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017.  We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for continuing to purchase new Garda vehicles over the years 2016-2021. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p></reply>

The Strategy sets out key actions under each theme and objective, which indicate the Government Department responsible and the timeframe for delivery.

This reform programme is about moving away from institutional models of care and service delivery to community-based, person-centred models of service where people with a disability can live valued and inclusive lives within their own community.  The programme is governed by a National Steering Group and is driven by six National Cross-Sector Working Groups.</p><p>The HSE funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual with a disability to achieve their full potential and maximise independence.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community service providers.  In their National Service Plan for 2017, funding of &euro;1.69 billion was allocated to the HSE for disability services.  The allocation for disability services for 2018 will be over &euro;1.76 billion.  The HSE is currently in the process of finalising its National Service Plan for 2018, in consultation with officials from my Department.</p><p>If the individual concerned requires access to any particular health and personal social service, the Deputy might consider contacting my office with the details and I will arrange to have the matter followed up directly with the HSE.</p></reply>

Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks.  The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p>  <p>  The HPRA is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland and operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions through this system.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the EMA's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.</p>  <p>  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the Health Service Executive are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for such services provided by their GP, or the practice nurse on behalf of the GP.</p>  <p>  The contract also stipulates that GPs must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum/deputy, for urgent cases outside normal practice hours.  This includes weekends.  GPs are reimbursed by the HSE for any services they provide to GMS patients outside of normal surgery hours.  While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out of hours cooperatives as a means of meeting their contractual out of hours requirements, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services helping to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the GMS contract explicitly states that GPs must not seek or accept money from eligible patients in reward for services provided under that contract.  Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and their patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p></reply>

This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies. </p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government's contingency planning. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and its agencies have been conducting detailed analysis on the impacts of Brexit in the area of health.  A number of issues are being examined and contingency planning for a range of eventualities is underway.  A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis.  The health sector has a highly mobile workforce and free movement issues and the mutual recognition and assurance of professional qualifications are being considered.  On regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across the European Union is enormously helpful &ndash; to protect human health, to ensure consumer protection and to provide a level playing field for industry.  The UK no longer being part of a harmonised regulatory system in relation to food safety standards, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and cosmetics could necessitate increased certification requirements or disrupt trade between Ireland and the UK. Ensuring continuity in the supply of medicines and medical devices following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is a priority.  The issue of customs is of relevance as it relates to additional food safety controls and medicines.  The implications of Brexit for networks and organisations such as the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, the European Reference Networks on rare diseases and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are also under consideration. </p>  <p>  These issues are currently being examined by my Department and its agencies and this work will continue over the period ahead.  The key priorities for my Department are to ensure continuity in the provision of health services and to avoid, or mitigate changes to the current situation that would have a negative impact on human health.  These are also key factors in considering the prioritisation of risks.</p></reply>

It is strongly recommended that people in at-risk groups get the flu vaccine.  &lsquo;At-risk&rsquo; people include those aged 65 years and older, people with chronic illness requiring regular medical follow-up, those with lower immunity due to disease or treatment, pregnant women, and residents of nursing homes, and other long stay facilities.  The priority for this winter is to increase uptake of the influenza vaccine in &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups and in health care workers to reduce and control the incidence of flu and outbreaks in the community and healthcare settings.</p>  <p>  Pregnant women should be given the flu vaccine as they are at a higher risk of serious respiratory illness and complications.  Getting flu in pregnancy can also lead to premature births and smaller babies.  As the flu vaccine is inactive it can be given safely at any time during pregnancy.  The flu vaccine protects women during their pregnancy and provides ongoing protection to their newborn baby during their first few months of life.  Ideally you should get the flu vaccine as early as possible in your pregnancy.  The flu season usually occurs between September and April and if you are pregnant through two flu seasons, two vaccines, one in each season, may be necessary.</p>  <p>  The flu vaccine is available from your GP or Pharmacist.  It is available free of charge from GPs for all people in 'at risk' groups, and from pharmacists for everyone in 'at risk' groups aged 18 years and over.  If you have a &lsquo;Medical Card&rsquo; or &lsquo;GP Visit Card&rsquo; the vaccine and consultation are free.  If you do not have a &lsquo;Medical Card&rsquo; or &lsquo;GP Visit Card&rsquo; the vaccine is free but you will be charged a consultation fee.</p>  <p>  The information on the HSE website clearly indicates that there is no thiomersal in the vaccine used in the 2017/2018 flu campaign.</p></reply>

This increase in demand has had a corresponding effect on waiting lists for paediatric rheumatology services. </p>  <p>  The HSE has developed a new National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare Services, which includes the development of a hub and spoke model of care for paediatric rheumatology as part of a national clinical network for paediatrics.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will have a central role in this national model of care which will include the provision of outreach clinics to regional centres to improve access for those children living outside the greater Dublin area.  The development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and urgent care centres will provide an opportunity to progress operational integration of the three existing children&rsquo;s hospital rheumatology services and to plan for the appropriate provision of these services well in advance of the move to the new facilities.  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has confirmed that facilities for rheumatology services in the new children's hospital will include clinical examination rooms in one of the Outpatient suites as well as day beds in the Day Care Unit which will be assigned to rheumatology in light of the fact that rheumatology is predominately an outpatient and day care based service.  Admissions to inpatient services will be accommodated in the medical ward.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query regarding current regional rheumatology services, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure that services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are, are safety assured and adequately resourced.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that hospital funding has increased by 28% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 29% from the 2014 base.  Funding of &euro;300,000 has also been provided in 2017 to facilitate the opening of the new medical assessment unit.</p>  <p>  In addition, governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise Hospital have been strengthened, additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise Hospital.  A draft plan was submitted to my Department in December 2016.  This draft report was reviewed in detail and was the subject of detailed engagement between Department officials and the HSE.  Significant additional work was undertaken by the HSE on foot of this engagement resulting in a revised draft plan that was submitted to my Department in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The report is currently under detailed consideration in my Department.  Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended that there will be further engagement with all interested parties, to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.  Any future changes to services at Portlaoise, will have to take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

I established a Task Force on Personalised Budgets on 20 September 2016, on foot of this commitment. </p>  <p>  The Task Force on Personalised Budgets consists of a Strategy Group and an Advisory &amp;amp; Consultative Group.  It includes officials from the relevant Government Departments and agencies, HSE, academic and policy experts, stakeholder organisations and a wide range of people with lived experience of disability and disability services (both intellectual and physical).  Its remit is to make recommendations on personalised budgets models which will give people with disabilities more control in accessing health funded personal social services, giving them greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs.  A Reference Group comprising people with lived experience of disability and disability services was also established, and the views of this group inform the Task Force deliberations.  </p>  <p>  Offering people the choice of a personalised budget is becoming increasingly common internationally as a way of providing people with more choice and control over the services and supports they access.  While the concept of personalised budgets is not limited to health and personal social services, the Task Force is focussing on personalised budgets for services for adults with disabilities funded by the HSE Disability Services in the first instance.  The Task Force has been asked to report with recommendations on personalised budget models by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Historically, personalised budgets have been made available to a small number of people participating in pilot projects and to a very limited number of people whose specific circumstances required additional flexibility.  Further roll-out of personalised budgets in 2018 will be informed by the Task Force report and will follow a structured implementation plan and process.  As the Deputy's query relates to a service matter I have referred the question to the HSE for review and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-21a.942.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112100080#WRS02800"><p>I presume by &quot;a patient-based information technology system on a national basis&quot; that the Deputy is referring to the HSE&rsquo;s plans for the phasing in of a national Electronic Health Record (EHR).  It should also be noted that the HSE is delivering a wide range of technology enabled programmes which support the delivery of Electronic Health Records.</p><p>The EHR business case, which has been developed by the HSE, highlights a number of optional timescales and investment approaches.  The scale of the task to implement a national electronic health record programme is very large, challenging and requires a complex planning, approval and tendering process.  It is a five to ten year programme of work depending on the scale of resources deployed.  We must also be cognisant of the delivery of an EHR in the context of the work being planned for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which aspires to be the first digital hospital facility in the country.  <font color="#FF4040"> </font></p><p>I welcome the recognition of the priority required for investment in the EHR Programme in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report which recommended &ldquo;continued strong support of the e-health strategy - particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system&quot;.</p><p>For a programme of this scale and scope, realistic timescales and funding options are important to ensure that the adoption of both the technology and the business change required by front line staff can be absorbed and managed in a coherent way.  In addition to resourcing the EHR project with substantial manpower and financial resources, experience from other countries demonstrates that the vendor markets supplying many of these services needs to be carefully managed in terms of capacity and capability to deliver working tailored solutions in a satisfactory manner.  The Electronic Health Record (EHR) as defined in the high level strategic business case has 4 main elements - the Shared Care Record, the Community &amp;amp; Primary Care EHR, the Acute Operational EHR and the EHR integration suite.  The Strategic Business Case is published on the eHealth Ireland website.  The HSE appointed a programme manager to oversee the implementation of the Electronic Health Record in May 2017 and work is continuing with the HSE and my Department on progressing the business case with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The next phase of the EHR programme is to develop detailed business cases for each component, specification of requirements, procurement documentation and support during the procurement process. </p><p>The HSE sought and received conditional sanction from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to undertake 4 tenders, utilising the Office of Government procurement framework, to provide them with external support for the programme.  The 4 tenders are for the delivery of support for the following areas:</p><p>- programme office;</p><p>- acute EHR;</p><p>- community EHR; and </p><p>- Shared Care Record and Integration.  </p><p>The tender documents were published in August and the tender process closed mid-September.  To date, one contract for this work has been awarded for the acute hospital EHR in view of the requirements for the National Children's Hospital.  In the case of the other two lots, a re-tendering exercise is underway.  The outputs from this work will allow greater clarity on the scope of the individual components for what is being procured and the detailed costings for each of the areas that will make up the electronic health care record.  Only when this detailed work is completed can the procurement process be considered for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and prioritisation assigned to the work.  The work in relation to EHR will continue and feed into the implementation response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report being prepared by my Department  .</p></reply>

Site preparation works were undertaken by the HSE during 2016.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 comprises a new 170 single bed National Forensic Mental Service facility.  This includes a 130 bed main hospital, as well as a co-located 10 bed Forensic Child and Adolescent Mental Health Unit, and a 30 bed Intensive Care Rehabilitation Unit.  Construction on Phase I commenced in June 2017, and this is progressing satisfactorily.  The new facilities will open in 2020, following Equipping and Commissioning stages.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the National Forensic Mental Health capital project envisages the provision of new regional Intensive Care Rehabilitation Units.  It is intended that these will be prioritised within the HSE capital programme over the medium term.  As the HSE has carried out some preliminary work on these proposals to-date, I have asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the detail of these.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government states that the Government wishes to provide more accessible respite care to facilitate full support for people with a disability. </p>  <p>  Health Service Executive (HSE) Disability Services engages in a detailed and person centred process with a wide range of agencies every year, to identify the most appropriate service provider and quantum of service, to meet the individual needs of each school leaver.  This process takes place over a number of months and is led by the needs of each individual school leaver.  In addition, HSE Disability Services also engages with individual school leaver families to listen to any concerns they may have regarding the process and works with both the families and agencies to seek an appropriate placement for the school leaver.</p>  <p>  Currently day services are transitioning to a new approach outlined in the policy New Directions.  Through the implementation of New Directions, work is on-going to develop a standardised pathway for all young people with disabilities and it is envisaged that this work will likely recommend earlier transition planning between educational and health care practitioners to facilitate a more seamless transition for these children and their families.</p>  <p>  The changed day services that are evolving as a result of this new policy implementation will mean that school leavers entering day services in 2017 and in future years will experience the benefits of the New Directions approach to service delivery.</p>  <p>  Interim Standards for New Directions have also been developed and will be phased in using a continuous quality improvement approach over the coming years. </p>  <p>  As the remaining issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure that services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are, are safety assured and adequately resourced.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that hospital funding has increased by 28% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 29% from the 2014 base.  Funding of &euro;300,000 has also been provided in 2017 to facilitate the opening of the new medical assessment unit. </p>  <p>  In addition, governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise Hospital have been strengthened, additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise Hospital.  A draft plan was submitted to my Department in December 2016.  This draft report was reviewed in detail and was the subject of detailed engagement between Department officials and the HSE.  Significant additional work was undertaken by the HSE on foot of this engagement resulting in a revised draft plan that was submitted to my Department in September 2017. </p>  <p>  The report is currently under detailed consideration in my Department. Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended that there will be further engagement with all interested parties, to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.  Any future changes to services at Portlaoise, will have to take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  Budget 2018 allocated additional funding in the region of &euro;10m for the remainder of 2017 to fund patient treatment across a range of key specialties and procedures.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, the HSE has been implementing Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding.  Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 29,000 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.  Long-waiting Urology patients are a core group who have received treatment under the Inpatient/Daycase Initiative. </p>  <p>  The NTPF has advised that to date 14,548 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its initiatives, 5,431 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 2,011 patients have received their procedure.  The NTPF has also indicated that 3,821 patients have been authorised for treatment in public hospitals under the Plan&rsquo;s insourcing initiatives, 1,471 offers of treatment have been accepted and 818 patients have been treated. </p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised that, as of 17 November, the total number of Urology procedures that have been undertaken through NTPF funding in both public and private hospitals is 305.</p></reply>

Currently there are approximately 55,000 people living with dementia in the Republic of Ireland, and this number is expected to almost treble to over 150,000 by 2046.  These numbers highlight the need for us as a nation to acknowledge and understand the condition and its impact on individuals and society as a whole.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the particular challenges faced by people with dementia and their carers, the Government published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Dementia Strategy in December 2014.  The purpose of the Strategy is to increase awareness of dementia, ensure timely diagnosis and intervention, and develop enhanced community based services. </p>  <p>  The Strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities for far longer than many people appreciate. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE agreed a joint Programme with the Atlantic Philanthropies in late 2014 to implement significant elements of the Strategy.  The National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme seeks to promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and the value of early intervention.  A key strand of the programme is the development of measures to raise public awareness, reduce stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.  The Dementia Understand Together campaign integrates these objectives under one campaign.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme also includes Intensive Homecare Packages for people with dementia; the upskilling of GPs and Primary Care Teams to diagnose and manage dementia; and the establishment of a National Dementia Office in the HSE to coordinate and drive the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation.</p>  <p>  The projected spend for Intensive Home Care Packages in 2017 is &euro;9m supported by HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies funding.  At the end of September 2017, out of a total of 236 people in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package, 148 people with dementia were in receipt of  a dementia specific Intensive Homecare Package.  It is also worth noting that people with dementia can also avail of standard home care.  The HSE continues to provide mainstream home help, routine Home Care packages and other appropriate community based supports such as day care, respite etc., to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.</p>  <p>  In budget 2018 a further &euro;37 million has been made available for older people services, comprising &euro;5m once-off funding in 2017 and &euro;32 million next year, to further strengthen supports for older people, particularly to facilitate speedier discharge from acute hospitals over the winter period.  A significant proportion of this additional funding will go towards home care services. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE to prepare the 2018 National Service Plan.  Pending agreement of the Plan I am not in a position to comment either on the funding that will be made available for dementia care or the specific services that will be provided.  I will be happy to update the Deputy once the Service Plan is finalised.</p></reply>

The Evaluation noted that the Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care Programme had made a major difference to the lives of children with palliative care needs and their families and recommended a strengthening of the Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care Programme to include more children&rsquo;s outreach nurses, a second consultant paediatrician post with a special interest in children&rsquo;s palliative medicine and a continuation of the education programme in Crumlin.  To date, all but one of the recommendations (recommendation 3) have been explored in further detail, and 17 of the recommendations are being progressed.  Some of the most significant areas of progress are highlighted below.  </p>  <p>  The aim of the children&rsquo;s outreach nursing service is to co-ordinate seamless continuity of care between the acute paediatric unit, community services and the child&rsquo;s home.  The nurse develops strong working relationships with colleagues within the acute and community settings e.g. paediatric medicine, general practice, community paediatric services, disability services, nursing services, specialist adult palliative care home teams, and voluntary services such as Jack and Jill, Laura Lynn, etc.  Two additional Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses were recruited in 2017, one in Donegal and one in Dublin.  A third new Nurse will be appointed in Kerry in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Consultant Paediatrician with a Special Interest in Palliative Care leads the specialist paediatric palliative care team in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin.  Preparations are under way to recruit a second consultant paediatrician with a special interest in children&rsquo;s palliative medicine who will be based in Temple Street.  This post will be funded by the IHF for the first year, and by the HSE thereafter.  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has agreed that the posts will be located in the New National Children&rsquo;s Hospital when opened.</p>  <p>  A business case has been submitted to the HSE&rsquo;s office for Nursing and Midwifery Service Development for the continuation of the training courses in Crumlin on caring for children with life-limiting conditions.  There is a commitment to provide training to meet the needs of community based adult palliative care teams and hospital based paediatric medical and nursing staff. </p>  <p>  The IHF and Laura Lynn have agreed to fund a national coordinator for children&rsquo;s palliative care for a three-year period.  Discussions are underway with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the appropriate Integrated/Clinical Programmes on the job description and the full integration of the role into paediatric services. </p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendation on the provision of adequate and needs based respite services, discussions have commenced with HSE Primary Care and Disability Services on the integration of children&rsquo;s palliative care with existing and future in-home and out-of-home services.</p>  <p>  The HSE is addressing the lack of available and standardised bereavement care in conjunction with the IHF.  A scoping exercise is required to identify existing services and gaps in service provision. </p>  <p>  As highlighted by the Evaluation, integration with disability services, primary care, complex care, the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the paediatric clinical care programme is being pursued as a key part of the implementation of the recommendations.  </p>  <p>  The HSE launched the Palliative Care Services Three Year Development Framework on November 14 2017.  This Framework was developed in order to inform and direct the development of adult palliative care services in Ireland for the remainder of this decade.  National policy on adult palliative care is largely based on the 2001 Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care.  Given the advances in changes in the landscape of Irish medicine in general, and in palliative care in particular, since 2001, the new Framework was developed in order to meet the changed landscape of palliative care.</p>  <p>  My Department does not intend to develop a separate framework for children&rsquo;s palliative care at present.  Implementation of the recommendations made in the evaluation of the Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care Programme provides a suitable framework that guides the development of children's palliative care for the coming years. </p></reply>

Any individuals employed by these Section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, therefore neither the HSE nor my Department has a role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff.  </p>  <p>  The staff of these Section 39 organisations are not public servants and therefore were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions.  It follows then that the staff of the Section 39 bodies will not be eligible for any pay restoration associated with the unwinding of this legislation and provided for under the more recent Public Service Agreements.  It is a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services. </p>  <p>  Whilst it is understood that pay cuts were imposed on Section 39 employees, it is not clear that these cuts were applied in a universally consistent manner across all the Section 39 agencies.  It is also important to recognise that this group of organisations within the health sector is just one element of a larger complex issue which could have significant cost implications for the Exchequer across the public services as a whole.</p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning.</p>  <p>  In line with this whole-of-Government work, my Department has conducted a range of analysis and research activities in relation to Brexit.  This work is ongoing, and is primarily concerned with the implications of Brexit for agri-food trade with the UK across different sectors. </p>  <p>  For example, both internally and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders through the Brexit Stakeholder Consultative Committee and the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, my Department has established the extent of sectoral reliance on the UK market, the potential implications of Brexit for each sector and the possible responses to the challenges presented.  It has also been analysing the potential practical impact on the day-to-day functioning of trade flows, as well as potential WTO tariffs that might be applied to Ireland's agri-food exports to the UK in the event of a 'hard' Brexit. </p>  <p>  The agencies reporting to my Department have also undertaken important research in relation to Brexit, with Teagasc publishing reports on, for example, the potential implications for the Irish agri-food sector in overall terms and on the implications for family farm incomes, and Bord Bia conducting important work through its Brexit Barometer. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is in contact with the relevant agencies and with other Departments to co-ordinate further research on the implications of Brexit for the agri-food industry.</p></reply>

However, most often this market access is agreed bilaterally between the Department and its equivalent competent authority in a Third Country.  This was the case in relation to Ireland gaining beef access to the USA in 2015, the first Member State to do so.</p>  <p>  Market access to Japan and South Korea for Irish meat products is currently being negotiated bilaterally.  These negotiations are not contingent on any EU-level agreements.  The recent Free Trade Agreements with South Korea and Japan relate to tariffs imposed on trade.  Quotas are not broken down by Member States. Rather, there is a tariff-rate quota for the entire EU.</p>  <p>  Ireland gained market access to Japan for beef at the end of 2013.  Current trade consists mainly of frozen beef offal, tongues in particular.  In 2016, more than 1,300 tonnes of bovine meat valued at &euro;7.5 million was exported.  Ireland also has pigmeat access to Japan and in 2016, a total of 4,750 tonnes was exported, at a value of &euro;14.2 million.   </p>  <p>  My Department has recently started bilateral negotiations in relation to getting sheepmeat access to Japan.  Japanese imports of Irish dairy produce exceeded &euro;14.8 million in 2016 and DAFM has recently agreed, with the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, bilateral export certificates for the export of dairy products from Ireland to Japan.  We are one of four EU member states at an advanced stage of negotiations to gain beef access to South Korea.  (The others being Denmark, Netherlands and France).  I was very pleased to use the recent Trade Mission as an opportunity to seek to advance progress on beef access on a bilateral basis for Ireland, as part of my meetings with Ministers there. </p>  <p>  Dairy exports to South Korea amounted to &euro;3.3 million last year.  Both Japan and South Korea have been identified as key strategic markets for future growth in dairy produce.</p></reply>

My Department has received a number of queries from various groups regarding the issue of pair trawling by fishing vessels including in relation to marine Special Areas of Conservation.</p><p>My Department understands that pair trawling in inshore waters and estuaries around Ireland is confined to fishing for sprat and that there are a number of potential impacts that the fishery could have on the local ecology of these areas.  In 2017, the Marine Institute is involved in an enhanced data collection program on coastal sprat fisheries that will provide new data on by-catch rates of non-target species.</p><p>In addition, a risk assessment was undertaken by the Marine Institute of fisheries interactions in Special Areas of Conservation (SAC).  The assessment included the potential risk posed by fishing for sprat: </p><p>- in the Shannon Estuary to the resident Bottle Nose Dolphin population, and</p><p>- in Kenmare Bay for Harbour Seals. </p><p>The assessment concludes that: </p><p>- The infrequent sprat fishery along the Clare and Kerry coasts is unlikely to significantly affect the Shannon estuary Bottle Nose Dolphin population. </p><p>- Local resident populations of this species do not rely on the food subsidy provided by immigration of pelagic fish. </p><p>- Also, they do not specialize in feeding on shoaling fish and take individual prey that are larger than sprat (16cm).</p><p>- The Bottle Nose Dolphin population in the Shannon Estuary SAC is reported to be stable. </p><p>- In relation to Harbour Seals in Kenmare Bay, the assessment noted that the risk posed by pelagic fishing on harbour seals through by-catch and disturbance of haul-out locations was low.</p><p>I encourage anyone who may have a concern about pair trawling by fishing vessels to work with the fishing industry on the issue through the industry&rsquo;s representatives, i.e. the various fish producer organisations and the Inshore Fisheries Forums.</p></reply>

We continue to monitor the situation closely and respond as appropriate to developments in order to defend the interests of Irish farmers, working in close co-operation with my Government colleagues, particularly the T&aacute;inaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Taoiseach.  Indeed, the Taoiseach raised the matter in the course of recent meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>  <p>  At political level, I have continuously raised the issue with my Member State colleagues and with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstr&ouml;m, both within the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in written form.  These efforts have been reinforced at official level through similar contacts with Member States and the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee. </p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 27 October, and I raised the matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg in October and again in Brussels on 6 November.  I have also worked very closely with a number of other Member States, most notably France, including in the production of a joint paper that was submitted to the European Commission on 26 September outlining our shared concerns.  And I wrote to Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m in early October, reiterating my concerns in relation to the tabling of a tariff rate quota (TRQ) offer for beef. </p>  <p>  I was deeply disappointed that the Commission decided to submit a beef TRQ offer during the October round of negotiations with the Mercosur bloc, as I believe that this could not be coming at a worse time for the EU beef sector.  However, it must be noted that no agreement on a Mercosur deal has been finalised at this point. </p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  In this regard I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.  Against this background I will continue to build alliances with other Member states and to defend the interests of the Irish and EU beef sectors. </p></reply>

No. 125 of 2016) establishes a point system, which will apply to the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy is detected.  It is intended that the new Statutory Instrument which I intend to sign shortly will replace S.I. No. 125 of 2016 and change the make-up of the Determination Panel set up under the 2016 S.I. to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement.  This will involve the appointment of three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General, thereby completely separating the enforcement and the determination functions.  The new SI will, to the extent possible, take on board the issues of concern in relation to procedures and processes highlighted in High Court judgments on this matter.  It will also address certain minor technical and drafting issues arising in S.I. No. 125 of 2016.</p>  <p>  In June 2016, I advised the Oireachtas that subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues, that I was hopeful of moving towards a system of sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, having consulted with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I made it clear that this move was subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues in order to ensure compliance with EU law.  </p>  <p>  There has been extensive examination and consideration of all the issues in relation to meeting our EU obligations to implement the points system in the interim period.  The firm legal view available to me is that it is not possible to deliver on an effective and dissuasive points system, as required under EU law, by assigning points to licence holders upon successful prosecution.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, as is the case with SI No. 125 of 2016, it is intended that the new SI will provide that points assigned to a holder of an Irish licence remain assigned regardless of any criminal proceedings pending, or the outcome of any such proceedings, in respect of the serious infringement concerned. </p>  <p>  In relation to rights of appeal, it is intended that the new S.I. will provide for a right to appeal to an independent Fisheries Adjudicator if the licence holder is dissatisfied with the determination of the Determination Panel.  The Adjudicator is a legal person appointed by the Minister.  </p>  <p>  It is also intended that under the new S.I. the licence holder may appeal on a point of law a decision of the independent  Fisheries Adjudicator to the High Court.  In the 2014 S.I., this appeal was &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; &ndash; this aspect of the provision has been removed.</p></reply>

The remaining proposals, some of which are dependent on the outcome of ongoing international negotiations, are expected over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific proposals that we have, I have launched a public consultation as part of our Sustainability Impact Assessment and I look forward to the outcome of that process which I intend to lay before the Oireachtas on the 28th of this month.</p>  <p>  While we only received the Commission proposals earlier this month, our preparation began much earlier.  In many respects, it is an all-year affair with the scientific data used to inform the negotiations collected continuously over a 12-month period.  It is the publication of this data from June onwards that allows us to begin our preparation in earnest as the advice gives a strong indication of what the proposals might look like.</p>  <p>  The long term scenario is unquestionably more important than short term gain and I&rsquo;ve often spoken about the importance of ensuring healthy, sustainable stocks.  Nevertheless, if a severe cut is recommended, I have a clear duty  to ensure that it is fully justified.  I am always conscious of the immediate impacts the decisions taken at the December Fisheries Council have for so many communities around our coast.  This is why I believe the advance preparation should be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible involving my own Department as well as Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute; all industry representatives and the Environmental Pillar.  This process is invaluable and helps me identify the key areas of concern.  </p>  <p>  I should also point out that the December Council doesn&rsquo;t happen in isolation from other fisheries negotiations.  A range of international meetings that effectively decide the quotas for some very important stocks such as mackerel, blue whiting Atlanto Scandian Herring and Albacore tuna are also conducted.  Ireland is a very active participant at all of these negotiations and they form part of the broader picture for our fishing opportunities that is sometimes forgotten in the bustle of December Council.</p>  <p>  In parallel to those negotiations, work is ongoing for myself and my team throughout the run up to December with a number of important technical meetings.  These meetings are not bureaucratic formalities.  They help me to understand the priorities of other Member States and also gauge where Ireland can build relationships to help us deliver our priorities at Council. </p>  <p>  This year, as always, we are facing challenging proposals in a number of fisheries.  Without pre-empting the outcome of the Sustainability Impact Assessment, or going into a stock by stock analysis, it is is safe to say that I am concerned about a number of the proposals, particularly but not exclusively, for stocks in the Celtic Sea.  Where cuts are justified by the scientific advice I will support them but, unfortunately, I do not think that all of the cuts proposed by the Commission are so justified.</p>  <p>  The Hague preferences, with which the Deputy is very familiar and indeed was a key figure in defending them during the Reform of the CFP, will, as usual come under attack.  Their retention is never certain and this year, in the context of Brexit, there is likely to be a renewed effort to limit their application.</p>  <p>  The December Council is always a challenge and this year will be no different.  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland is well prepared and I will do my utmost to ensure that the final outcome is one that is good for the industry and the long term sustainability of the stocks.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding.</p><p>While good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advising that 9.5% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  The SEAI's most recent assessment is that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% to 96%  to its target.  However, while the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including a new  Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and Renewal Heat Incentive (RHI), contingency planning has commenced in the Department to explore  the potential  extent, mechanisms and cost of addressing  our target within the framework of the  Directive.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Directive provides a comprehensive framework for Member States to work towards achieving individual and EU renewable energy targets, including mechanisms for countries to work together such as statistical transfers, which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.</p><p>In the absence of an established market  mechanism, estimates of the cost of using  instruments such as Statistical Transfers are necessarily  tentative.  Work undertaken by the SEAI in 2016  indicated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.  However, the European Commission's EU Reference Scenario, Energy, transport and GHG Emissions Trends to 2050,  which is available at the following link, <i></i>, states that modelling indicates that the<i></i>overall EU level target of 20% will be met, underlining the difficulty in any market estimate  process and the vulnerability to a range of cost assumptions and the level of transfers that might be required in a market where the overall target at EU level is met.  Costs per percentage point for statistical transfers could be below the lower end of the range suggested by SEAI but this will depend on market conditions when and if purchases are made.</p><p>Any requirement for statistical transfers to meet compliance would be undertaken against a background of discussions by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission and relevant Member States.  As any purchases arising would be made over a period, the costs to the Exchequer of acquiring statistical transfers to meet any potential shortfall would be spread over a period of more than one year and in any event the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021, the deadline for completion of all purchases.</p></reply>

Management of salmon stocks is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and is supported by scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and Ireland&rsquo;s independent Standing Scientific Committee.  Salmon research in coastal areas and in the marine environment concentrates on increasing knowledge of migratory patterns, marine based mortality and return rates to home rivers.  Stock assessments are carried out on the individual genetic stock in each of Ireland's 147 salmon rivers, river sections and estuaries  </p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies.  In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles, the Irish Government closed mixed stock salmon fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing.  Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over their individual conservation limit and in estuaries where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits.</p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced in 2007 under which fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery could opt to voluntarily cease fishing and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.  In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.  The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008.  It is considered that individual river stocks would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented. </p></reply>

These include the creation of an entirely new process around the protection of critical national infrastructure and separate measures around the security of Digital Service Providers.  These are all being designed and delivered by my Department at present.  Significant progress has been made in both of these areas; for example, last week Minister of State Kyne launched a public consultation on the draft security measures that will be required of Critical National Infrastructure operators in the State under this Directive.  The legal components of the Directive will be put into place by Statutory Instrument, early in 2018. </p>  <p>  The dynamic and challenging nature of this issue, and the risks posed to citizens and the State, are clearly significant.  The NCSC will likely require further statutory powers beyond those required under the Directive, and that  Heads of Bill in this regard will be brought before Government in due course.  Priority is currently being given to the drafting of the secondary legislation to facilitate the transposition of the Network and Information Security Directive.</p></reply>

This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p>  <p>  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p>  <p>  - The  AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing  procurement process. </p>  <p>  - The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p>  <p>  - The Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018 as part of an Agreement signed with me in April. </p>  <p>  There are over 2.3 million premises in the State. Approximately 540,000 fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention.  Just under 1.5 million premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be covered by commercial providers, while approximately 300,000 are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment.    </p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  The &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team.  The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.</p>  <p>  As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and rollout.  Delivering connectivity to the premises in the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.  </p>  <p>  In April, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis by the end of 2018.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Agreement is available on my Department's website, www.dccae.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Moreover, the Programme for Government sets out that Ireland&rsquo;s long-term interests are best supported by further decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels through the continued development of renewable electricity generation.</p>  <p>  As energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are inextricably linked, meeting this objective will require a radical transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil-fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system.  It is recognised that certain renewable technologies such as wind and solar may have complementary generation profiles however both solar and wind remain intermittent renewables and therefore the DS3 programme managed by Eirgrid is critical to upping the non-synchronous limit of renewable electricity on the system. </p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contribution to EU-wide targets out to 2030.  The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a wide range of commercial renewable technologies, including solar photovoltaics (Solar PV) and both onshore and offshore wind, at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the emerging principles of the proposed RESS closed on 10 November.  Over 1,250 submissions were received and these will now be reviewed and considered and will inform the final design of the RESS.  Following on from this public consultation and review, a final proposal will be brought to Government for approval in early 2018, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. </p>  <p>  At this point no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS.  I welcome and have noted with interest the falling costs of some renewable technologies over the past year, most notably Solar PV and offshore wind.  Increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver and falling technology costs may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.  </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency produces detailed greenhouse gas emission projections on an annual basis for all key sectors of the economy in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies.  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the EPA, published in April 2017, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p><p>The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using banked allowances from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which may result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p><p>With regards to other Member States, a European Commission Communication published on 7 November 2017<i>, </i>Two years after Paris &ndash; Progress towards meeting the EU&rsquo;s climate commitments (COM (2017) 646), indicated that in addition to Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg and Malta are also expected to miss their 2020 EU targets on the basis of current projections. </p><p>The European Environment Agency (EEA) report, Trends and projections in Europe 2017, published on 7 November 2017, provides an updated assessment of the progress of the European Union and its Member States towards their 2020 targets based on the latest available official projections at Member State level.  This gives a detailed analysis of the position of each Member State relative to their respective targets and the extent to which each country currently contributes to total EU emissions.  The report also includes analysis of progress towards EU and Member States&rsquo; renewable energy and energy efficiency targets.  The report confirms that while the seven Member States referred to above are expected to miss their targets, the European Union as a whole is well on track to meet its 2020 obligations.</p></reply>

A key objective of the Plan is also to close the gap to Ireland's 2020 EU target and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective, the Plan identifies over 70 mitigation measures and 106 related actions to address the immediate challenge to 2020 and begins the process of developing medium-to-long-term policy options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Importantly, the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.  As this first Plan moves through the implementation phase, this process will enable it to be amended, refined and strengthened over time and assist in keeping Ireland on target to meet our obligations.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Ireland currently relies on imported fossil fuels to meet over 88% of our energy needs at an annual cost of approximately &euro;4.6 billion.  Given the inextricable link between energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, achievement of the commitments set out in the National Policy Position will require a significant transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil-fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">To support this ambition the Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place or under development.  These include the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff schemes, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, and a Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme.  Together with a range of energy efficiency measures implemented through schemes managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, these measures reflect the on-going Government commitment to, and investment in, decarbonisation of Ireland's energy system.</font></p></reply>

The most recent data, for the year 2015, were published on 13 April 2017 and are available on the EPA's website at .  According to this data, the breakdown of emissions by sector in 2015 is as follows: <table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Mt CO2eq.</th><th>% of total 2015 emissions</th></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>19.81</td><td>33.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Transport</td><td>11.83</td><td>19.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Industries</td><td>11.80</td><td>19.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Residential</td><td>6.04</td><td>10.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Combustion</td><td>4.55</td><td>7.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial Processes</td><td>1.99 </td><td>3.3%</td></tr><tr><td>F-Gases</td><td>1.14 </td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial Services</td><td>0.94 </td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Public Services</td><td>0.81</td><td>1.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Total ETS</td><td>16.84</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Non-ETS</td><td>43.04</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>Total for all sectors</td><td>59.88</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector has been the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions over the period 1990 to 2015.  The transport share of overall national emissions has increased from 9% in 1990 to almost 20% in 2015, and transport emissions are expected to increase in the coming years as the economy continues to grow strongly.  EPA inventory data for the transport sector distinguishes between road transport, railways, and domestic navigation and aviation.  Emissions from the agriculture sector reached an absolute peak in 1998 and, by 2015, were 5.5% below their 1990 levels, albeit on a rising trend since 2012. </p><p>The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development sets out an ambitious long-term commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. </p><p>Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The Plan sets out Ireland&rsquo;s vision for achieving the transition to a decarbonised economy, identifying over 70 mitigation measures and 106 related actions across different sectors of the economy.  </p><p>The National Mitigation Plan outlines a number of measures that are already contributing to emission reductions in the transport sector, including: sustained investment in the public transport network; the introduction of a Biofuels Obligation Scheme; regulations limiting tail pipe emissions in cars; incentives to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles; and redesigning the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and motor tax regimes to promote low carbon emitting vehicles. </p><p>In relation to electric vehicles, in May of this year the Government approved and published the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030.  This policy framework sets an ambitious target that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero emissions (or zero emissions capable). The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles.  The work of the Taskforce is well underway and has already resulted in a package of measures in Budget 2018 designed to promote a low carbon, electric vehicle future.  </p><p>The National Mitigation Plan also presents options for a range of additional measures which will further intensify efforts to mitigate emissions from the transport sector. These include: </p><p>- the implementation of the National Planning Framework (currently being finalised by Government), which aims to ensure better integration of land use and transport planning policy in order to reduce commuter travel demand and support more efficient patterns of development and travel; </p><p>- increasing public transport capacity and securing a shift, where feasible alternatives exist, away from private car use; </p><p>- encouraging the take-up of alternative fuels to petrol and diesel; and </p><p>- increasing the obligation under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme to further reduce the concentration of high-emitting fuels. </p><p>The long-term vision for the agriculture, forest and land-use sectors is based on an approach to carbon neutrality. </p><p>It should be noted that the agri-food sector is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous manufacturing industry, with total agri-food employment, including on-farm employment in primary agriculture, forestry and fishing, as well as the food processing industry, accounting for over 165,700 jobs. The most recent data available shows the agri-food sector accounting for 7.6% of Gross Value Added (2014), 23% of all manufacturing turnover (2014), 8.4% of employment (2015) and 10.7% of merchandise exports (2015). Current analysis suggests that the emissions intensity per kcal of food output in 2013 is reduced approximately 14% relative to 2005 and early estimates project that the &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario 2030 emission intensity will be a quarter below the emission intensity in 2005. Further, early estimates of agriculture with additional measures is approximately 35% below 2005, although absolute emissions remain reasonably stable.</p><p>The National Mitigation Plan highlights a number of measures that are already contributing to emission reductions in the sector, including: the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP); Knowledge Transfer Programme; Green, Low Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS); Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II); Organic Farming Scheme; Smart Farming Programme; Business, Environment and Technology through Training Extension and Research (BETTER) Farms Programme. </p><p>Importantly, the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.  As this first Plan moves through the implementation phase, this process will enable it to be amended, refined and strengthened over time and assist in keeping Ireland on target to meet our obligations.</p></reply>

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme. </p>  <p>  Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate "Zones" for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation; Zone B: the Cork conurbation; Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000; and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 30 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones.  This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at www.airquality.epa.ie. The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone. </p>  <p>  The Agency's most recent annual Air Quality Report was published in November 2017 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2016.  Values for all network sites were below the EU annual limit value, but exceeded the stricter World Health Organisation guideline values for a number of pollutants at individual sites.   The report indicates that most pollutant concentrations are low, with no discernible trend or slight downward trends.  It cautions however that NO2 concentrations in urban areas are close to the EU annual limit value, and increases in traffic numbers or certain weather conditions may lead to exceedances. The report can be found at the following link: http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/air/quality/epaairqualityreport2016.html.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the favourable comparison with EU annual limit values, the report notes that maintaining our standard of air quality is a growing challenge.  With this in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first ever National Clean Air Strategy.  The Strategy, which I hope to finalise in the coming weeks, will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives.</p>  <p>  A key part of the Strategy will be the expansion of our monitoring and data gathering capacity, to better inform policy  choices.  Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements over the period 2017 to 2022.  I fully support this important initiative, and have committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme, which will significantly strengthen the capacity and capability of the monitoring network to provide more comprehensive, localised air quality information linked to public health advice.</p></reply>

Plastics feature across a wide range of applications and products, such as packaging, construction, electrics and electronics, agriculture, medical and health.  The last waste characterisation study carried out by the EPA showed that 12.4% of our household waste, by weight, was plastic.</p>  <p>  The effects of plastic pollution, in particular, on the marine environment has been well publicised. My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is responsible for marine environmental policy, including marine litter policy in the first instance.  Both he and I recognise that the waste we create on land, and certain plastic waste items, in particular, can represent significant marine litter problems.  Accordingly we are working together to identify measures to address this with our European partners.   </p>  <p>  The European Commission circular economy action plan has identified plastics as one of five priority areas for action.  On packaging waste, the Commission proposed new reuse and recycling targets.  The Commission also pledged to adopt, by the end of 2017, a 'strategy on plastics in the circular economy, addressing issues such as recyclability, biodegradability, the presence of hazardous substances of concern in certain plastics, and marine litter'.</p>  <p>  In terms of plastic packaging at a national level, Repak, the producer responsibility scheme tasked with managing packing in Ireland, has been working with its members (including all the major retailers)  to identify ways to reduce or optimise packaging.  Under the EU Packaging Directive, Member States cannot impede the placing on the market of packaging which is fit for purpose. Notwithstanding this, I am working with the Regional Waste Management Offices to roll out a number of initiatives to support household waste recycling, including the recycling of plastics, which will ensure that end users are informed and empowered to choose the most environmentally friendly form of packaging.  </p></reply>

That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.  My Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p><p>In parallel with the NBP, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July 2016, I established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention. </p><p>The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report containing 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Report is available on my Department's website.</p><p>The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  Meetings were held in March and July and the next is scheduled for tomorrow (22 November). </p><p>Achievements to date by the Taskforce include:</p><p>- Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer;</p><p>- Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies, including Government working closely with local authorities to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs which will be connected at an early date after award of the NBP contract;</p><p>- ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services. ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map;</p><p>- most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development; </p><p>- Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out. TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms operators. </p><p>The Taskforce is also making progress on two of its actions focussing tackling blackspots in coverage.</p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.</p><p>All of these initiatives will assist in improving the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

For instance, collectors of waste must conduct their activities in accordance with the relevant legislation and the conditions of their waste collection permits which, <i>inter alia</i>, require that waste is managed in line with the waste hierarchy.</p><p>The Government's policy of increasing the landfill levy to its current level of &euro;75 per tonne has provided a real financial incentive for waste operators to divert as much material as possible from being disposed of at landfill. The success of the above and many other policy and legislative measures, (including the National Waste Prevention Programme and the phasing out of flat rate fees for household waste collection), which encourage waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery, has meant that more waste can be put to environmentally sustainable and productive use as opposed to being buried in the ground. </p><p>Statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling and recovery rates and reducing our reliance on landfill. In this regard, <i>National Waste Statistics - Reports and Bulletins </i>are available to download at http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/waste/stats/ including the recently published table on <i>Progress towards EU waste recycling, recovery and diversion targets.</i></p></reply>

Nearly 73,000 (80%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be covered by commercial providers, while approximately 4,500 (5%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment.</p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  The &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team. The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.</p>  <p>  As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales and plans to priority areas, for the network build and rollout.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p>  <p>  To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The review recommended revising the eligibility criteria for the disabled parking permit to focus on limitations on mobility rather than on diagnosis of particular medical conditions or illness.  This was in line with the original intention of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The disabled parking scheme is operated on behalf of my Department by the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland (DDAI) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWA), which are the two bodies empowered to issue disabled parking permits.  As Minister, I have responsibility for the regulations under which the scheme operates.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to review eligibility criteria at this time.  However, should the key stakeholders, in particular the DDAI and/or the IWA, present a case for a further review of the scheme - or indeed specific aspects of it, I would be willing to give consideration to it.</p></reply>

This substantial investment will allow us to further increase the numbers cycling, thereby easing congestion, improving public health and enhancing the liveability of our cities, and will have, I believe, a transformative effect on our cities over the next four years and beyond.  It is of course, also of paramount importance to me, that as we encourage more people to cycle, we are also providing them with safe infrastructure in which to do so.</p></reply>

The Department has also been in discussions with Sport Ireland who are developing, in conjunction with Healthy Ireland, a &ldquo;Get Ireland Cycling&rdquo; programme, as set out in the National Physical Activity Plan. My Department also contributed material on cycling to the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP)  and the National Communication (NC7) documents, which were coordinated through the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  In regard to cycling promotion, officials  of my Department and myself met with cycling advocates over the summer to discuss the potential for change in cycling promotion.

Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.

Section 7(10) of the Transport (Re-Organisation of C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann) Act, 1986, which established the three subsidiary companies of CI&Eacute;, provides that a resolution for the voluntary winding up of a company shall not be adopted unless resolutions have been passed by each House of the Oireachtas consenting to such winding up.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to speculate on the circumstances that would trigger such a declaration of insolvency.  I believe Bus &Eacute;ireann has a vital role to play in providing transport services and implementation of the April Labour Court Recommendation can provide for a successful and sustainable future for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  More generally, I have committed toward building upon the increased funding.  I have already provided for both capital investment and PSO support for the public transport sector, in which the Company remains a key player.</p></reply>

Of these, 323 (5%) did not have an allocated social worker.  It is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, their needs are reviewed regularly by the Principal Social Worker.  </p><p>Tusla does not collate data by county; however the the relevant information, correct to end of August 2017 is detailed in the following table.  This information is published monthly as the &ldquo;National Performance and Activity Dashboard&rdquo; on <i>.</i><table><tr><th>Administrative Area</th><th>Dublin South Central</th><th>Cork</th></tr><tr><td>Number of children in care</td><td>378</td><td>836</td></tr><tr><td>Number of children in care awaiting allocation of a social worker</td><td>1</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Number of open cases</td><td>1,347</td><td>3,561</td></tr><tr><td>Number of open cases awaiting allocation of a social worker</td><td>434</td><td>597</td></tr><tr><td>Number of high priority open cases</td><td>120</td><td>146</td></tr></table></p><p>I am informed by Tusla that a case awaiting allocation may be listed as 'active' on a 'duty ' system.  This means that there are actions being undertaken by a dedicated duty team or rotating social workers on a duty roster to progress the protection and welfare of the child.  Examples of actions being undertaken include telephone calls relating to the concern, visits to see the child, completing initial assessments and, where a child is in care, completing child in care reviews or care plans.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that there were 25,775 open cases nationally at the end of August which includes children in care.  Of these, 5,536 were awaiting allocation of a social worker.  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  Of these, 1,019 were designated as high priority, 3,441 as medium priority and 1,076 as low priority.  A high priority case can include children needing further child protection assessment and intervention, children involved with child protection court proceedings, children in care for less than 6 months and children with high risk mental health and anti-social difficulties.  Many children who are deemed medium and low priority have welfare rather than child protection needs and will engage with family support services.</p><p>The following table provides information on the length of time the 1,019 high priority open cases are awaiting allocation of a social worker.  </p><p><b>High Priority Open Cases Awaiting Allocation, by time waiting August 2017</b><table><tr><th>1 month</th><th>425</th></tr><tr><td>1 - 3 months</td><td>222</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>372</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,019</td></tr></table></p><p>Addressing the number of children who are awaiting the allocation of a social worker is a priority for me.  I secured additional funding for the purpose of addressing this issue in 2017, and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to provide for the allocation of a dedicated social worker to all children who need one.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health leading to the need for an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party.</p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard and I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and senior management team to review progress.</p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning.  </p>  <p>  With regard to my own Department, the Deputy will be aware that in January of this year I hosted an all-Ireland sectoral dialogue with young people, members of the Advisory Council for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, and other stakeholders in Croke Park to discuss the potential impact of Brexit on the lives of children and young people on the island of Ireland.  The key findings of this important event have been published in a report which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Since then, the Advisory Council has considered the report and work is ongoing in relation to the more detailed implications of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, matters in relation to Brexit were discussed by over 100 children and young people in April of this year as part of the annual regional Comhairle na n&Oacute;g Networking events.  This has enabled my Department to identify those issues which may impact on children and young people, post-Brexit, and indeed identify other issues which resonate strongly with our youngest citizens. </p>  <p>  The consultation and research undertaken to date by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has identified a number of issues of potential concern should negotiations between the EU and UK not conclude successfully.  However, these matters are small subsets of much larger items which will be considered, in the main, in conjunction with colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Justice and Equality, Education and Health as part of the wider negotiating process. </p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience.  AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. </p><p>Where a pre-school provider, in conjunction with a parent, considers that some additional support is needed in order to meet the needs of a child with a disability in an inclusive way, an application can be made for a suite of targeted supports, namely:</p><p>Level 4: Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support</p><p>This level provides access to mentoring for early years practitioners from a team of dedicated Early Years Specialists.  To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile.  This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting.  </p><p>Level 5: Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations Capital Grants</p><p>This level provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early years settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme.  A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.</p><p>Level 6: Therapeutic Intervention</p><p>This level provides access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to fully participate in the ECCE Programme.  To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete the online Access and Inclusion Profile.  The Early Years Specialist will review the profile and, where therapeutic input is likely to be required; the Specialist will initiate contact with the HSE.  The HSE decides on the appropriate level of therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room</p><p>This level provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme.  It is estimated that pre-school providers may need Level 7 in the case of approximately 1% to 1.5% of all children.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p><p>AIM was launched in June 2016.  The total funding allocated and outturn in 2016 and 2017 to levels 4, 5 and 7 of AIM by my Department is set out in the table.  Funding for AIM Level 6 comes from the Department of Health Vote.</p><p>The Inter-Department Group, which developed AIM, recognised that it would take approximately three years to fully develop and implement the Model.  It is expected that demand for all levels of support under AIM will increase in years 2 and 3 and the budget available for AIM makes provision for this. <table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Element of

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience.  AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. These include:</p><p>Level 1: An Inclusive Culture - This level is the critical foundation for the model.  This sets out that a strong culture of inclusion must be fostered and embedded to support all children&rsquo;s maximum participation in the ECCE Programme.  Under this level, a new Inclusion Charter has been developed.  Updated Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines have been published and a nationwide training programme on these Guidelines is currently being rolled out.  By mid-October, almost 1,900 pre-school practitioners completed this training.  A new higher education programme, Leadership for Inclusion for Early Years (LINC), has also been developed and up to 900 pre-school practitioners are expected to graduate from this Programme every year for the next 4 years.  These graduates will work as Inclusion Co-ordinators in their pre-school setting attracting an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.</p><p>Level 2: Information for Parents and Practitioners - This level recognises the requirement of parents and pre-school practitioners to have clear, consistent and up to date information accessible to them regarding early years services and supports.  A dedicated website <i>(</i><i>)</i>has been launched under this level and a communications strategy is currently being developed by my Department.</p><p>Level 3: A Qualified and Confident Workforce - This level, in recognising the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children wishing to participate in the ECCE Programme, provides for a multi-annual training programme for pre-school practitioners.  In May 2017, my Department established a Training Working Group to develop and support the delivery of a suite of training courses for pre-school practitioners under AIM Level 3.  These courses, which will be funded by my Department, will be available from 2018. </p><p>Where a pre-school provider, in conjunction with a parent, considers that some additional support is needed in order to meet the needs of a child with a disability in an inclusive way, an application can be made for a suite of targeted supports, namely:</p><p>Level 4: Expert Educational Advice and Support - This level provides access to mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated AIM Early Years Specialists.  To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile.  This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting.  </p><p>Level 5: Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations Capital Grant<b>- </b>This level provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for pre-school settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme.  A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.</p><p>Level 6: Therapeutic Intervention - This level provides access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to fully participate in the ECCE Programme.  To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete the online Access and Inclusion Profile.  The Early Years Specialist will review the profile and, where therapeutic input is likely to be required; the Specialist will initiate contact with the HSE.  The HSE decides on the appropriate level of therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room - This level provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  Rather, it provides additional capitation to the early years setting, which can be used to:  </p><p>a. reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room by enrolling less children without financial loss or  </p><p>b. increase the adult ratio in the pre-school room by buying in additional assistance.</p><p>Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the early year setting.</p><p>The total funding allocated to AIM for 2018 by my Department is &euro;32.42m.</p><p>My Department has lead responsibility for AIM and works with the Departments of Education and Skills and Health, and a range of agencies and organisations, (i.e. City and County Childcare Committees, the Early Years Specialist Service, the Health Service Executive, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authorities and Pobal) on AIM implementation. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-21a.1465.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112100089#WRBB05800"><p>The Government is committed to supporting entrepreneurship and self-employment.  Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension will be extended to the self-employed from 1 December 2017.  </p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.5% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.75% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.5% or 14.75%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   </p>  <p>  I understand the Deputy is also seeking information on access to jobseeker payments for the self-employed.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is means tested and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit which is a contributory scheme provide income support to people who have lost work and who satisfy the qualifying conditions including being available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  </p>  <p>  As stated above self-employed people pay PRSI at Class S which does not cover them for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  However, a self-employed person who has sufficient social insurance contributions as an employee could qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit provided they either give up their self-employment or if their self-employment is considered to be &ldquo;subsidiary employment&rdquo; i.e. undertaken in addition to and outside of the ordinary working hours of his/her usual employment.  In addition, the person must have paid at least 117 employment contributions during the three years preceding the date of their claim or have earnings from the occupation of less than &euro;12.70 per day.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a self-employed person may qualify for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  If the person were engaged in farming they may qualify for the means-tested farm assist payment.</p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on 18 October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers will be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state.  </p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population. </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory.  </p>  <p>  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of state pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced, the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The tenant and landlord must complete the rent supplement application form declaring that the information provided is accurate. It is therefore very difficult for the Department to identify these types of arrangements where both the tenant and landlord have confirmed the information provided. </p>  <p>  Rather than increasing rent limits at this time and in recognition of the ongoing difficulties in the rented market, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the maximum limits. The Protocol arrangement in place with Threshold continues to operate in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Dublin, Cork, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow and Galway City. Over 1,500 increased payments over the rent limits have been made this year to date. </p>  <p>  The provision of flexibility above rent limits is providing a mechanism to address increasing rents, including those in &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; payment arrangements. People in these situations are advised that their position can be regularised and that they should contact the Community Welfare Service for assistance. </p>  <p>  The continued flexible case-by-case approach together with the recent reforms to the private rental sector, notably the cap in the Rent Pressure Zones, is providing increased certainty and security for rent supplement tenants.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to keep these matters under review.</p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit. This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures. These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios. This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning.</p>  <p>  In relation to the areas under my remit, the key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance (which includes pensions) and social assistance (means tested schemes linked to residency rights) and child benefit between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing its assessment of the implications of Brexit, including where no withdrawal agreement is concluded, on these areas on a scheme-by-scheme and client basis. This is part of ongoing Brexit analysis and scenario planning for input into larger Government deliberative processes and it is considered that all of these areas merit equal prioritisation as they fundamentally relate to the rights, entitlements and wellbeing of our citizens. </p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 625,530 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2017. </p><p>Given the universality of Child Benefit it is not a payment which lends itself to a targeted approach, and the considerable costs associated with any adjustment to the payment can result in benefits being spread very thinly, rather than making a difference where there is most need.  </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education up to the age of 18 (and up to the age of 22 under certain circumstances), including:</p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>- the working family payment (formerly Family Income Supplement) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second-level education rate).</p><p>As part of measures under Budget 2018, the weekly payment for each qualified child will increase from &euro;29.80 to &euro;31.80.  This is an increase of 6.7%, and will benefit over 400,000 children.</p><p>Also in Budget 2018 earnings thresholds for Family Income Supplement, to be re-designated as the Working Family Payment, were increased by &euro;10 per week for families with up to three children.  This measure will particularly benefit low-income working families.</p><p>All of the schemes described above provide targeted assistance directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p></reply>

Name, date of birth, place of birth and mother&rsquo;s birth surname are generally verified from the birth certificate or, in the case of an adopted person, from an adoption certificate. </p>  <p>  Generally, in the case of an adopted person, the details on the birth register will be different to those on the adoption register and not consistent with their current identity.  </p>  <p>  As my Department has access to the Irish Birth Register the above details can be verified without the need for the individual to physically present a birth certificate, providing that the record can be located on the Register.  </p>  <p>  However, in contrast, my Department does not have access to the Irish Adoption Register.  Accordingly, staff would not be aware of a customer&rsquo;s adoption status.  In such circumstances the individual is asked to bring a copy of their adoption certificate.

The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  The post-2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% contributory pension.  Had all pensions been cut, regardless of means and contribution records, the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional income, those paid a State pension non-contributory, and widows and widowers living alone on only one pension payment.</p>  <p>  People on the lower rate bands with other income, which meant they did not qualify for a non-contributory pension which is paid at a rate of over 95% of the contributory pension, are generally in a better financial position than those solely dependent on the non-contributory pension, as otherwise they could claim that payment instead.  Changing these bands would give additional money to people who already have means.  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10-12 million each following year.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to introduce a Total Contributions Approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory) from 2020 onwards and I will bring forward proposals in this regard in the near future.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I have asked my officials to carefully examine approaches that may help to address the issue in relation to the averaging approach as it affects people with a short work period early in their career followed by a significant break to raise children, who retired after the 2012 changes but before the Total Contributions Approach has been implemented.  We need to ensure that any proposed approach would not cause further anomalies or disadvantages to arise, or hinder the move to a Total Contributions Approach.  We also need to determine, as best we can, the cost of any such approach and how that cost could be financed in the future.  I would like to re-emphasise that any change with a significant cost is unlikely to be viable before the provisions of Budget 2019 are in place.</p>  <p>  Spending on State pensions has increased rapidly in recent decades.  This year, the cost is &euro;7.3 billion.  This is estimated to increase by &euro;1 billion every five years due to the increased number of pensioners.  These projections mean that there are considerable sustainability and affordability challenges in the years ahead and we must start to address them now.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I want to ensure that any approach taken is fair and sustainable in the long term.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This broad approach estimates the level of income needed to meet an individual's / household's physical, psychological and social needs, and which is calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs.  The report&rsquo;s findings show that the cost of an MESL is estimated to be higher for a person with vision impairment than for members of the general population.  Overall, it was estimated that the additional cost in 2016 for an individual with vision impairment was &euro;44.54 more than the cost for a single adult in the main MESL (&euro;241. 22).  I understand that the authors are conducting further work in this area in relation to the income and other supports available to persons with a vision impairment and it would be expected that this analysis would contribute further to the information available.</p>  <p>  The Department provides a range of income support for people with a disability and their dependants.  People with vision impairment who require income support can apply to my Department for a blind person&rsquo;s pension.  There are currently some 1,280 people in receipt of a blind person&rsquo;s pension at a cost of some &euro;13.5 million in 2017.  Alternatively, the disability allowance payment can be claimed by a person with vision impairment which substantially restricts them in undertaking suitable employment.  The current rate of payment for both the blind person&rsquo;s pension and the disability allowance is &euro;193 per week for a single person.  Budget 2018 provides an additional &euro;5 per week for each of these payments, bringing the rate up to &euro;198 per week next year.  </p>  <p>  Primary weekly social welfare payments are intended to enable recipients to meet their basic day-to-day income needs.  While these payments make a very significant contribution to broader poverty and social inclusion goals, they are not designed to address some of the wider issues associated with the cost of disability.  One of the difficulties of providing a cost of disability payment is that people with disabilities are not a homogeneous group and as such would have widely differing needs with the result that  the extra costs of disability would not arise to the same extent in all cases.  </p>  <p>  However, some of these additional costs are addressed across schemes provided by a number of agencies such as the Health Service Executive and also the Revenue Commissioners through certain tax reliefs and other supports.  For example, I understand that a person who is blind or who has impaired vision can claim from the Revenue Commissioners the blind tax credit potentially worth &euro;1,650 per year for a single person. I also understand that the Health Service Executive operates a supplement scheme which is means-tested &ndash; the blind welfare allowance &ndash; for blind people receiving certain welfare payments, including the blind pension.  The current rate of payment is &euro;58.50 per week for a single person.</p>  <p>  While my Department keeps all its schemes and supports under review, there are no specific plans to change income support payments for the visually impaired. Any further increases in the rates of payments to people with disabilities, including those with vision impairment, would have to be considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

In this regard the Department has set up dedicated enquiry telephone lines and specific email addresses for each section in the Department solely for the purpose of dealing with queries from members of the Oireachtas in relation to individual social welfare cases/claims.  This also helps reduce the costs of answering Parliamentary Questions (PQs).</p>  <p>  DEASP receives one of the highest number of PQs of all Government departments.

The  majority of PQs refer to the status of claims by individuals in relation to the variety of schemes administered by the Department.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 600 staff members of varying grades involved at some level in distributing, answering and submitting PQs for approval across the Department.  The length of time spent on dealing with PQs can vary from a few minutes to a number of hours per week.  As the processing of answering PQs is undertaken as part of the normal day to day work of the individual sections within the Department it is not possible to readily isolate the costs of processing PQs from the overall administrative costs of the Department.</p></reply>

The CSP works on a social-enterprise model.  This means that it does not fully fund contract holders but requires that they generate revenue by charging fees or raising funds.  All CSP recipients are obliged to meet these criteria.  These social enterprises also remain responsible for their own budgets and financial liabilities.</p>  <p>  It is not policy to remove services and support from community services programmes that are unable to generate traded income of 30% of overall annual turnover.  Approximately 57% of all CSP supported enterprises meet the 30% guidance figure which, it should be noted, excludes fund-raising and donations.</p>  <p>  CSP service providers are community businesses that operate using a social enterprise model of delivery, which means they are trying to become less dependent on state support.  The defining characteristic of CSP services is that they are set up to provide social and economic value and are managed as going concerns with business and revenue targets set within a business plan.  CSP investment is allocated through a co-funding approach, with a salary contribution provided towards the costs of employing a manager and/or a specified number of full time equivalent positions (FTEs) to community businesses that deliver services to, and create employment for, people from disadvantaged groups.  Service providers are able to operate by generating sufficient traded income to cover their company and service operating costs (e.g. premises rent, vehicle costs, utilities, materials, etc.) as CSP support provides partial grant support towards the cost of each staffing position and does not cover operating costs.</p>  <p>  Services must generate sufficient traded income to be viable and sustainable entities.  Services that do not generate sufficient traded income are unlikely to be effective and risk the closure and loss of service to their local area.  To identify and support organisations that are in difficulty, a review of each service provider&rsquo;s annual financial statements is undertaken by Pobal, who operate the programme on behalf of my Department.  Any positive or negative trends in financial performance are noted.  The figure of 30% of turnover for traded income provides an early indicator of possible financial issues.  It is also part of a &lsquo;rule of thumb&rsquo; that includes CSP funding not being more than 50% of annual turnover.  This acts as a guideline for organisations.  Any decision to reduce or remove grant support is taken after a broader assessment of the contract holder in areas such as service performance, the need for each staff position and financial data.  To this end, Pobal and my Department look at the contract holder&rsquo;s track record and performance.  This includes an assessment of the capacity of work scheduled against the level of CSP allocation (including any spare capacity or under-utilisation in relation to the CSP funded positions in terms of the level of income generation) and whether it could be done under a relevant activation programme which, in some cases, can be much more effective and less of a cost to the organisation.</p>  <p>  All CSP contract holders must periodically submit a business plan to Pobal for assessment. Pobal will then provide a recommendation to my Department for a decision on the issue of a future CSP contract.  This business plan provides prospective new entrants and existing contract holders the opportunity to highlight relevant socio-economic information pertaining to their service and geographical area.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the business plan is to encourage organisations to undertake a strategic review of their operations to ensure the services they provide match the continuing needs of the local population or sector of society being served.  Secondly, as CSP support is sourced from public funds, a value for money determination is made.  The information provided in the business plan is also necessary to demonstrate that CSP investment is meeting an evidenced need in a particular community.  It is important for service providers to use available statistics such as the Pobal HP deprivation index in their business plan, supported by local research, to verify the need for the service and demonstrate that they meet the criteria of the programme.  In summary, any decision to grant or remove CSP support does takes available socio-economic information into account.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a major reform as self-employed people could have access to income support without having to go through a means test, if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability.  The Department has commenced a national radio and print media campaign to ensure that self-employed people are aware of this significant development and to provide details of how to apply.</p>  <p>  Since March 2017, self-employed people have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  This measure benefits over 300,000 self-employed workers and their dependants.

A range of sanctions, including disqualification, closure or disallowance of the jobseeker claim, may be imposed where a client fails to meet the stated conditions.  A jobseeker claim may be reviewed at any time in order to establish continued entitlement.</p>  <p>  Additionally, in relation to activation services, legislation provides that further sanctions/penalties in the form of reduced payments may be imposed by a Deciding Officer where clients fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures.  Activation measures include the requirement to attend group or individual meetings with case officers and/or avail of suitable education, training or development opportunities, or specified employment programmes, which are considered appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>  <p>  Where a person continues to fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures, while on a penalty rate, he/she may be disqualified from receiving the personal rate of payment.  The normal rate of payment may be reinstated at any time, if the jobseeker complies, as requested, with activation measures.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the rules and processes for the application of a reduced rate of payment are the same across all of the Department&rsquo;s activation services, whether they are delivered directly by the Department&rsquo;s own Intreo service or through its contracted services such as the Local Employment Service (LES) or JobPath service.</p>  <p>  Only a departmental official - and not contractor&rsquo;s staff - can make a decision to apply a reduced rate of payment.  Contractors have no role in the decision making process.  The process with regard to such decisions includes written/verbal warnings from a departmental official and an opportunity for the jobseeker to re-engage with the services prior to the application of a reduced payment rate.</p>  <p>  Up to the end of October 2017 approximately 9,000, or 6.9% of the total 129,000 clients who engaged with the JobPath service between July 2015 and October 2017 have had, at some point, a penalty rate applied to their payment: some of these clients may have had the penalty rate applied after finishing their engagement period with the JobPath service, so the actual numbers who have had a penalty rate applied while with the JobPath service will be lower.</p>  <p>  To be clear, the application of penalty rates is entirely a matter for my department and officials involved will take into account all relevant factors including where appropriate non-engagement with externally provided activation services.  In this regard, while I am happy to advise the Deputy on penalty rates applied to those who have engaged with the JobPath service, the factors to be considered in applying a penalty rate precludes me from making a definitive statement that the sole context involved would have been non engagement with JobPath.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

The maximum rate of pension is payable where a person has a yearly average of at least 48, and there are banded entitlements below that.</p>  <p>  In calculating the yearly average, the number of full-rate contributions paid and/or credited is counted up to the end of the tax/contribution year before reaching pension age (66), and this total is divided by the number of tax/contribution years in their record up to that point.  For example, if someone&rsquo;s record was from 1972, and they turned 66 on 1 July 2016, it would be the contributions they paid or were credited in the period to 31 December 2015, divided by 44 years (i.e. every year from 1972 to 2015).  Taking the subsequent period into account to calculate the yearly average could only increase their contributions by a maximum of 26 contributions, and if their yearly average was already higher than that, this would have the effect of reducing their yearly average, rather than increasing it, as the amended total would be divided by 45.  Given the fact that in most cases, this would result in a lower rather than a higher yearly average, it is to most people&rsquo;s advantage that the rule should apply as it does now.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that the contributions can still be used to satisfy other pension conditions (notably the requirement to have a minimum of 520 contributions paid to qualify for State pension contributory).</p>  <p>  It should be remembered that PRSI does not just fund the State pension contributory and enable people to qualify for that payment, but also working age benefits before they retire.</p>  <p>  I do hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This provision allows local authorities to enter into contracts with property owners in order to secure properties for use as social housing support. The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 gives legislative recognition to rental accommodation availability agreements as a form of social housing support. Consequently, since 1 April 2011, all Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) tenants are considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.</p>  <p>  Chapter 4 of Part 2 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, relating to rental accommodation arrangements, has not been commenced to date because its commencement requires that section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, is commenced. Section 31, which provides for the introduction of a national framework for social housing rents, has not been commenced. Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes. These proposals were examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to review the disparate systems of differential rents for social housing in place across local authorities. The review will be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  In recognition that pre-2011 RAS tenants may have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued by the Housing Agency in 2011 recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway provided for such RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. The arrangement effectively allows these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list. Post 2011 RAS tenant may seek a transfer to other forms of Social Housing Support in the normal manner.</p>  <p>  With the commencement of the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is considered to be a social housing support. Ministerial Directions were issued during the pilot phase of the scheme to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP tenants could avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list. With the completion of the HAP roll-out and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase on 1 March 2017, a further Ministerial Direction was issued, instructing local authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list. The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and, as such, is a matter for the elected members.</p>  <p>  The assessment of applications for social housing support, and management of the lists of qualified households, including the recording of data on the number of applications refused, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations. The assessment of individual applicants for social housing support is a matter for the individual local authority, and each application is examined on a case by case basis. It is a matter for the local authority to determine the housing solution that best meets the needs of the applicant, while taking into account the resources and type of housing available to the authority. Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of support for that household. My Department does not have a breakdown of the number of households supported by RAS or HAP which include people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  My Department has made resources available under a range of schemes to local authorities which allow them to seek the most appropriate housing solution available to meet the housing needs of those households presenting.  In a situation where a tenant has been deemed eligible for RAS, and the landlord (providing the property meets the necessary standards, is registered with the RTB and is tax compliant etc.) is also willing to enter a RAS agreement, there is no obstacle to the authority progressing such an application.</p>  <p>  I have provided &euro;134.3 million in Budget 2018 to support the cost of RAS. Monies are provided on an Exchequer neutral basis to meet the costs of persons transferring from the Rent Supplement (RS) Scheme to the RAS.

Therefore, housing affordability has been examined by my Department, in consultation with the Housing Agency, local authorities and other stakeholders as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland.  The examination was carried out under the generally accepted premise that housing is deemed affordable where households, particularly low- or moderate-income households, are paying no more than a third of their disposable income on meeting their accommodation needs.</p>  <p>  Through the Rebuilding Ireland programme, Government policy is clearly focused on increasing housing supply, particularly the supply of homes at more affordable price points.  Recent housing activity reports, available on www.rebuildingireland.ie, show that strong supply-side measures introduced under Rebuilding Ireland are beginning to have a positive impact, with all output indicators showing positive upward trends:</p>  <p>- Planning permissions are up 49%: 19,246 new homes were granted planning permission in the year to end June;</p>  <p>- Commencement Notices are up by 49%: notices for 17,323 new homes nationwide were submitted in the year to end September; and</p>  <p>- ESB connections to the National Grid are up 26%, at 17,958 homes nationally in the year to end September, 8,177 of which are in the Greater Dublin Area.</p>  <p>  Regarding those most challenged in terms of affordability, there were 91,600 households on the social housing waiting list in 2016. The Government is committed to meeting this need and that is why I have increased the overall target for new social housing delivery by 2021 under Rebuilding Ireland from 47,000 to 50,000 homes, with the total ring-fenced investment increasing from &euro;5.35 billion to over &euro;6 billion to 2021.  In order to meet the overall social housing need, there is also a target to deliver 84,000 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) tenancies. Over 19,000 households had their needs met in 2016, with a further 21,000 such supports due to be delivered in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to ensuring there is a supply of affordable homes.  A range of measures have been taken, for example, planning reforms to provide flexibility to deliver viable housing schemes and apartment developments in the right locations, and the provision of funding to service housing lands through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), to deliver new homes that are more viable and more affordable than would otherwise be the case.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, the Government has removed significant obstacles to building more homes, more quickly, and at more affordable prices by:</p>  <p>- Investing more in direct house-building by the State;</p>  <p>- Removing the Capital Gains Tax incentive to hold on to residential land;</p>  <p>- Escalating penalties for land hoarding; and</p>  <p>- Providing a new, more affordable finance vehicle for builders through House Building Finance Ireland (HBFI).</p>  <p>  In addition, as announced in the Budget, I am providing funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically for affordable housing, using models such as co-operative housing initiatives which have already proven to be successful but are now needed at greater scale.  The criteria for accessing this new fund are currently being considered by my Department and I expect to be in a position to announce details in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

In August, my Department published a guidance document to assist and support local authorities in implementing the new Regulations.</p>  <p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from a portion of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees, collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).</p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the RTB, over &euro;34 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 185,000 inspections were carried out during this period.  The Department offers a subvention to local authorities to carry out inspection of properties under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations. Funding is currently dispersed on the basis of &euro;100 per inspection carried out and &euro;50 per follow-up inspection which achieves compliance.</p>  <p>  Over the five years from 2010 to the end of 2014, a total of &euro;442,115 was provided to Wicklow County Council for inspection purposes; &euro;107,918 in 2010, &euro;134,325 in 2011, &euro;87,972 in 2012, &euro;75,300 in 2013 and &euro;36,600 in 2014.

Nevertheless, in order to ensure that we are designing and implementing policy supports that are compassionate and effective, and in order to get a better understanding of which responses are working and which are not, international comparisons must be made.  It is because of this very practice that we have moved to introduce Housing First here in Ireland.  In this way we can better meet the needs of people who are experiencing a very traumatic time in their lives, by looking to other practices as well as our own and adopting the best response.</p>  <p>  When commenting on comparisons between countries, my focus is on countries that are broadly similar in socio-economic and cultural terms, without any reference to developing countries where homelessness is often a major societal issue.  Furthermore my comments are based upon the understanding that homelessness means people sleeping rough or those residing in emergency accommodation for homeless persons &ndash; i.e. &lsquo;rooflessness&rsquo; and &lsquo;houselessness&rsquo; &ndash; rather than incorporating all categories of housing exclusion, such as individuals living in overcrowded housing or adult children living with their parents; such individuals would be included in housing authorities&rsquo; waiting lists if approved for social housing supports.  It is important that this separation is made.</p>  <p>  There are a number of sources that indicate that the rate of homelessness per capita is higher on a pro-rata basis across most European countries than it is in Ireland.  This assessment is evident in an OECD report published in July 2017, and while it does state that it should not be used as a league table, it does show trends in those countries presented, which are useful when analysed against our own.  One of the most comprehensive EU comparisons ever carried out which was published by FEANTSA (European Federation of National Associations Working with the Homeless) in 2014, found Ireland to have one of the lowest rates of homelessness among the Member States analysed.</p>  <p>  Of course, direct international comparisons cannot be precise because of the availability, quality and consistency of homeless data at the international level.  Nevertheless, going beyond these reports, both England (Department of Community and Local Government) and Scotland (Scottish Government) produce homeless statistics, which are available online, that are sufficiently similar to Irish statistics in terms of timeliness, quality and categorisation to allow direct comparisons be readily made in relation to those in emergency accommodation.  An analysis of the latest statistics from both those jurisdictions demonstrates that a significantly higher number of households are accommodated in temporary arrangements in England and Scotland than is the case here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As indicated earlier, irrespective of international comparisons, I remain clear that the level of homelessness in this country is unacceptable and addressing it will continue to be a top priority for me and the Government.</p></reply>

The level of the reduction is proportionate to the scale of the LIHAF investment in the enabling infrastructure which is different for each project. </p><p>Local authorities have used a range of mechanisms to meet the cost reduction commitment, tailored to the individual circumstances of each proposal.  In some instances, the local authority itself owns some or all of the associated development lands and consequently has a high degree of control in terms of ensuring delivery of extra social and affordable housing over and above the 10% normally required under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>Where land is owned privately, providers of housing have entered into an undertaking with local authorities where, in recognition of the early delivery of the necessary public infrastructure, those providers have undertaken that housing will be delivered in accordance within an aligned timeframe of construction and with agreed cost reductions to be taken off the market price.  This can be an agreed cost reduction across all units or a larger cost reduction across a specified number of units.</p><p>My Department is preparing summary details on each of the approved projects and intends to publish this on the Department's website as well as on the Rebuilding Ireland website shortly.</p></reply>

Budget 2018 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme by &euro;149m to &euro;301 million in order to meet the continuing costs of existing households and the costs of meeting the additional 17,000 households, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2018.  The increased rent limits introduced by the Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  On average in 2017, 350 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week, with over 29,800 households currently having their housing needs met under the scheme, and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.  However, it is open to local authorities to take a consistent approach in relation to use of discretion in a given locality or in relation to a particular household type.  Additional discretion of up to 50% above rent limits is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region.  The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households face in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market.  Detailed guidance has been provided to local authorities in relation to the approach to be applied when assessing HAP applications.  This guidance applies to new and existing households seeking HAP rental supports within local rent limits and in excess of rent limits, and in relation to the management of reported top-ups.  The local authority must make a decision on what level of support to provide based on the tenant&rsquo;s current position and the needs of a household, as well as the market rents in that local area.</p>  <p>  From available data, at the end of Q2 2017, 17.8% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 12.6% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility.  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.7% above rent limits provided.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  Where a qualified household sources accommodation outside the maximum rent limits, it is important to highlight the responsibility falling on the household to ensure the landlord receives the full amount of rent charged for the property as set out in their tenancy agreement. </p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, recommended the introduction of a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising - where households have greatest difficulties in finding accommodation they can afford.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for the Rent Predictability Measure and for areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents can now only rise by a maximum of 4% annually for a period of three years.</p>  <p>  This measure was implemented immediately in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork City as these areas already met the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone in December 2016.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) were designated in January 2017, with the measure further extended to Maynooth and Cobh LEAs in March 2017 and to Drogheda and Greystones LEAs in September 2017.</p>  <p>  On 19 September 2017, I announced a number of improvements to the rental market as part of the rolling review of Rebuilding Ireland.  One such change is that the RTB will be given additional powers and resources to take on a regulatory responsibility in the rental sector over the next two years.  The changes needed in legislation and in the Board&rsquo;s financing arrangements will be explored and a two-year change management plan will be prepared that will see the RTB become the sector&rsquo;s regulator in that period.  It will be an offence to implement rent increases that contravene the law and the RTB will be given the powers to investigate and prosecute landlords who implement such increases.  The onus will no longer be exclusively on the tenant.</p>  <p>  Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.  Based on the data outlined, I am currently satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to meet the demand of the rental market in these areas.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the HAP scheme is generally working well and that the additional measures in relation to the rental market under Rebuilding Ireland will provide further support for its operation.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 29,800 households having their housing needs met via HAP and over 20,000 landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments.  A weekly average of  348 HAP tenancies have been set up during 2017, and more than 420 a week averaged over the last 5 weeks.</p><p>Recognising the pressures in the rental market, the Government increased the maximum rent limits available under the HAP scheme across the country with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all local authorities operating the HAP scheme from the same date.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. </p><p>The increased rent limits introduced by the Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork City regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP.  I recently confirmed that the Place Finder Service available in these local authorities will be rolled out to all other local authorities. </p><p>It should be borne in mind that the HAP scheme was implemented on a statutory phased pilot basis and rolled out across local authorities incrementally over the last number of years.  The scheme became a national scheme on 1 March 2017, and the following table reflects the data available to my Department for all 31 local authorities at end of Q2 2017: <table><tr><th>Local Authority<br /><br />Area  </th><th>Number of HAP  supported households at end of Q2   2017</th><th>Number of HAP supported households where   additional flexibility was utilised by LA</th><th>% </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County   Council</td><td>515 </td><td>36 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County   Council</td><td>60 </td><td>1 </td><td>1.7% </td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>1,113 </td><td>47 </td><td>4.2% </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>1,290 </td><td>413 </td><td>32% </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>2,127 </td><td>157 </td><td>7.4% </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County   Council</td><td>1,540 </td><td>3 </td><td>0.2% </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council*</td><td>375 </td><td>95 </td><td>25.3% </td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council*</td><td>46 </td><td>37 </td><td>80.4% </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County<br /><br />Council* </td><td>121 </td><td>49 </td><td>40.5% </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td>645 </td><td>305 </td><td>47.3% </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County   Council</td><td>570 </td><td>45 </td><td>7.9% </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>194 </td><td>27 </td><td>13.9% </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County   Council</td><td>1,128 </td><td>432 </td><td>38.3% </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>800 </td><td>14 </td><td>1.8% </td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>88 </td><td>3 </td><td>3.4% </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County   Council</td><td>42 </td><td>-</td><td>0.0% </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>1,767 </td><td>28 </td><td>1.6% </td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td>60 </td><td>-</td><td>0.0% </td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>1,568 </td><td>68 </td><td>4.3% </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>624 </td><td>408 </td><td>65.4% </td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>856 </td><td>315 </td><td>36.8% </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>360 </td><td>12 </td><td>3.3% </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>465 </td><td>3 </td><td>0.6% </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>74 </td><td>- </td><td>0.0% </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>347 </td><td>2 </td><td>0.6% </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council*</td><td>1,783 </td><td>13 </td><td>0.7% </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council</td><td>1,407 </td><td>150 </td><td>10.7% </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>1,339 </td><td>56 </td><td>4.2% </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath  County Council</td><td>148 </td><td>10 </td><td>6.8% </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County   Council</td><td>192 </td><td>8 </td><td>4.2% </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County   Council</td><td>164 </td><td>10 </td><td>6.1% </td></tr><tr><td>Total (Excl DRHE) </td><td>21,808 </td><td>2,746 </td><td>12.6% </td></tr><tr><td>*DRHE </td><td>1,428</td><td>1,391 </td><td>97% </td></tr><tr><td>**Grand Total (including DRHE) </td><td>23,236 </td><td>4,137 </td><td>17.8%</td></tr></table>*In Dublin City Council, DLR, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils, eligible homeless households are assisted under the Homeless HAP scheme operated by the DRHE, under which additional discretion is available in recognition of the difficulty that can exist in housing homeless households.  These homeless HAP numbers are not included in the HAP numbers identified under each of these Dublin LA areas in the table.</p><p>**Tenancy numbers reflected above show all HAP tenancies set up at end Q.2 2017 where the rent was agreed.  A further 607 HAP tenancies were set up at this point, but were awaiting final rent agreement.</p><p>The Department will monitor this data each quarter, taking into consideration other sources of data such as the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) Rent Index and Average Rent Index Reports, which are published on a quarterly basis.  The Rent Index Report is compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), and based on the RTB&rsquo;s own register of tenancies, the Rent Index reveals the actual rents being paid for rented properties. </p><p>This data together with the latest data on the use of discretion by local authorities, set out above, indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  I am satisfied with how the scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.  My Department will, of course, continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p></reply>

This commitment was underpinned in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which provided for the commissioning by the Housing Agency, on behalf of my Department, of an expert, independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority TAPs and actual units delivered, the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports. </p><p>This report was finalised and submitted to the National Traveller Accommodation Committee (NTACC) for consideration at its meeting on 28 August 2017.  The NTACC is a statutorily-appointed Committee, comprising key stakeholders, including Traveller representative groups, to advise the Minister with responsibility in relation to Traveller accommodation matters.  On foot of its considerations of the report, the NTACC collectively agreed to advise me to establish an Expert Group to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  This is in keeping with the Programme for Partnership Government and I have agreed to proceed with the establishment of this Expert Group.  </p><p>I have also agreed that a review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 should be part of the work of the Expert Group.  The composition, terms of reference and methodology of this Expert Group are currently being formulated with a view to it being in place as soon as possible.  </p><p>The amount of funding allocated and drawn down by all Local Authorities for Traveller accommodation in 2016 and to-date in 2017 is set out in the Table.<table><tr><th>County Council</th><th>Allocation 2016</th><th>Recouped 2016</th><th>Allocation 2017</th><th>Recouped 2017 to date</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>130,000</td><td>0</td><td>207,905.41</td><td>71,449.98</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>8,600</td><td>9,398</td><td>13,729.31</td><td>13,729.31</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>200,000</td><td>0</td><td>169,194.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>30,000</td><td>0</td><td>110,000.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>82,000</td><td>74,532</td><td>147,612.81</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>63,000</td><td>26,397</td><td>1,024,289.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>26,842</td><td>0</td><td>26,847.00</td><td>17,420.00</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown</td><td>419,095</td><td>129,552</td><td>1,500,000.00</td><td>1,823,999.72</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>117,000</td><td>123,816</td><td>625,000.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>57,000</td><td>255,730</td><td>28,566.13</td><td>28,566.13</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>200,000</td><td>0</td><td>80,000.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>377,500</td><td>431,714</td><td>582,162.00</td><td>524,109.12</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>-</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>18,800</td><td>12,794</td><td>98,875.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>2,900</td><td>0</td><td>2,922.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>0</td><td>444,484</td><td>237,087.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>-</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>120,000</td><td>76,877</td><td>129,000.00</td><td>5,750.00</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>-</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>73,000</td><td>37,775</td><td>847,917.00</td><td>22,700.00</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>50,000</td><td>10,808</td><td>52,617.00</td><td>52,616.62</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>161,249.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>900,000</td><td>1,399,370</td><td>327,492.00</td><td>399,337.00</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>208,000</td><td>48,000</td><td>-</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>96,000</td><td>87,695</td><td>6,880.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>46,000</td><td>0</td><td>52,648.00</td><td>43,773.00</td></tr><tr><td>City Council</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>400,000</td><td>301,796</td><td>1,108,344.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>1,405,198</td><td>762,342</td><td>414,829.00</td><td>140,038.59</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>40,000</td><td>0</td><td>209,000.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>81,000</td><td>21,209</td><td>69,576.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>263,000</td><td>13,545</td><td>545,000.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>5,500,000</td><td>4,267,831</td><td>9,000,000.00</td><td>3,143,489.47</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These requirements are in line with best practice in other countries and Ireland is one of the first countries to have such a broad requirement for carbon monoxide alarms.</p><p>The requirements under Part J provide for the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in:</p><p>- new dwellings where open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed,</p><p>- existing dwellings where replacement open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed,</p><p>- habitable rooms where a system chimney attached to a heat producing appliance passes within or over such rooms.</p><p>While these regulations will give added protection to new dwelling owners, and to the owners of existing dwellings when heat producing appliances are being replaced, it is important to note that the key actions required to prevent carbon monoxide incidences are and continue to be:</p><p>(1) the proper installation and commissioning of heat producing appliances and flues/chimneys,</p><p>(2) proper air supply is maintained to combustion devices, and</p><p>(3) the proper maintenance and inspection of combustion appliances on a regular basis.</p><p>In this regard, an analysis of the incidents that have occurred in the UK indicate that the predominant area for carbon monoxide fatalities is in dwellings.  This analysis would appear to suggest that non-domestic buildings would not be considered a high risk category having regard to the number of carbon monoxide incidences involved.  Accordingly, the installation of carbon monoxide alarms in buildings other than dwellings is not required under the Building Regulations, either here or in the UK.</p><p>From the evidence of carbon monoxide incidents in the UK and abroad, the majority appear to occur with solid fuel and gas appliances, and the least with oil fuelled appliances.  Open flue or flueless appliances, because they take the combustion air from a room, have a potentially greater risk than a balanced flue scenario.</p><p>In addition, Part L of the Building Regulations, which deals with the conservation of fuel and energy, has required all new and replacement boilers in dwellings to have an efficiency of 90% since 1 December 2011.  This promotes the installation of room sealed boilers, which have a lower risk of the escape of carbon monoxide due to balanced flues.</p></reply>

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p><p>Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on the register in 2018.

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.</p><p>Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK.</p><p>As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning.</p><p>The outcome of the vote of 23 June 2016 in the UK will have implications across all aspects of the business of the European Union.  While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere.</p><p>As the Deputy has previously been advised, on 19 January, 2015 Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Department of Defence, Ireland and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence on enhancement on certain aspects of Security and Defence Cooperation.  This provides a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence.  The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding placed already existing co-operation arrangements in the Defence area between Ireland and the UK on a more formal and transparent footing, while fully respecting the differing policy positions and security arrangements of both States.</p><p><b></b>The MoU takes into account matters such as military forces training; exercises and military education; exchange of views on EU Common Security and Defence Policy; potential for joint contributions to UN Crisis Management Operations; joint procurement initiatives; pooling and sharing resources; general sharing on reform in defence services; potential for staff exchanges; joint contribution to Security Sector Reform and capacity building in crisis locations and the sharing of information.</p><p>Having regard to the bi-lateral arrangements already in place, and the fact Brexit does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland's continuing engagement in the EUs Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is not considered that a detailed and specific contingency plan in the Defence sphere is necessary at this time.  Such a requirement will be kept under constant review and all potential consequences in the defence sphere, arising on foot of ongoing negotiations will remain the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department throughout this process.</p><p>In that regard while the implications for the border will emerge during the course of the negotiations, it is this Government&rsquo;s stated goal to try to ensure that the current on-island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible.  The fact of a UK exit from the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border security requirements at this time.  Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p><p>Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners on request.  The Defence Forces at all times keep operational plans under constant review.  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place.</p><p>The Government remains under no illusions about the complexity of these negotiations or the potential impacts that may arise on their conclusion.

My Department is however committed to providing whatever assistance possible to support the implementation of the strategy on homelessness. </p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department continues to engage with local authorities in relation to the acquisition of Departmental property that is no longer required for military purposes or housing. Discussions are ongoing in relation to the transfer of properties that could form part of the general housing stock available to local authorities, thus contributing to efforts in alleviating the problem of homelessness. </p>  <p>  In addition, since 2014, part of St Bricin&rsquo;s military installation in Dublin has been made available to Dublin City Council as emergency accommodation for the homeless.  The allocated area provides space for 27 beds.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it should be noted that particular issues arise in relation to providing accommodation to civilians within an operational military barracks, foremost amongst them being security. Furthermore, many vacant former housing units on barracks premises are in very poor state of repair.  Their condition is inconsistent with the standard that would be required for living accommodation and a significant investment in both cost and time would be required in order to make them habitable and compliant with current health and safety legislation.</p></reply>
