For minimal cost, the measure helps raise Ireland's profile at a time of year when many potential tourists are planning their annual holidays.     </p><p>  More than 120 landmark buildings and iconic sites around the world were part of the initiative in 2014.  Amongst the high profile sites which were &quot;greened&quot; again this year were the London Eye, Niagara Falls, the Moulin Rouge, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Sydney Opera House.  In addition, some new sites were added for the first time in 2014 including the Great Wall of China, the Grand Place in Brussels and City Hall in Savannah.  The full list of all sites can be found on Tourism Ireland's website.  In 2013, Tourism Ireland estimate the initiative generated publicity worth approximately &euro;10 million in advertising equivalent value.  I expect this figure to be matched or exceeded this year.   </p><p>  In 2013, on foot of Deputy O'Donovan's proposal,  the initiative was expanded to include a number of buildings in Ireland.  This continued in 2014 when  a total of 28 buildings under the remit of the OPW took part in the &quot;greening&quot;.   Many other public bodies also took part as well as local authorities across the country.  The St Patrick's Festival Company also engaged with Dublin City Council and others to arrange for the greening of key landmarks around Dublin.   </p><p>  Obviously the initiative can only take place because of the efforts of many.  As well as Tourism Ireland, particular credit must go to Ireland's Ambassadors and Embassies overseas, the Office of Public Works, the St. Patrick's Festival Company as well as the public bodies and Local Authorities who support this initiative.  Now that it is firmly established, I have no doubt that the &quot;greening&quot; will play a part in raising Ireland's profile as an tourism destination for many more years to come.</p></reply>

The project is progressing well and to agreed timelines.  While all construction projects may give rise to problems from time to time, I understand from the NTA that there are no significant difficulties or unexpected issues arising in relation to Luas Cross City and that every effort is being made to ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum as construction proceeds.   </p><p>  The building condition works along the Luas Cross City corridor and the Cellars Infill works have been completed.  The Utilities Works commenced at a number of locations in the city centre in January 2014.  The tender process for the main infrastructure contract has commenced and the anticipated award date for this contract is November 2014.  Work is then expected to commence in early 2015 and to be completed by the end of 2016.  Following testing, commissioning and trial runs the line is expected to be operational at the end of 2017.   </p><p>  A Traffic Forum has been established representative of the NTA, RPA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council, and Dublin Bus as well as business representatives and there is on-going consultation between the Forum and contractors on proposed works and traffic impacts.  The project Communications Director and local liaison officers also consult and engage on a regular basis with all parties and a city centre Project Information Office is located in Hibernian Way.  I also chair a high level project group which includes business and trade representatives to monitor progress at a strategic level and to ensure that the city remains &quot;open for business&quot; while the project is being delivered.</p><p>  There are currently no plans to develop a light rail system in other cities.  The public transport needs of these cities will be kept under review in the context of on-going public transport planning and available funding.  Under the current capital plan my Department funds a programme managed by the NTA to improve public transport in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  This programme funds projects such as bus lanes, green routes, cycle lanes and safety measures for pedestrians &amp;amp; cyclists.</p></reply>

The tendering and award of contracts for Public Service Obligation (PSO) services comes under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).   </p><p>  In accordance with the decision made by the NTA Board on the arrangements for the award of public transport contracts after December 2014, all Dublin Bus routes will be included in the direct award contract which the NTA will enter into with Dublin Bus next December.  However, a number of local and orbital bus routes will only remain within the direct award contract until the end of 2016 when they will be competitively tendered and thereafter removed from the direct award contract and provided under a separate contract.  These local and orbital routes include a number of routes that serve the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  I will take this opportunity to point out that the state, in the form of the NTA, will be the body who determine the schedule, the frequencies, vehicle-types associated with these services.   </p><p>  Since November the NTA has been engaged on the detailed work involved in the preparation of the necessary procurement and contract documentation required to implement the NTA Board's decision.  The NTA expects the procurement process for the routes to be tendered will begin in December 2014 leading to the award of the contract in March 2016 with the successful operator commencing services in late 2016.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-02a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040200051#WRA01700"><p>I have no plans to bring forward further legislative changes in the area of taxi regulation.  The Taxi Regulation Act, 2013, was enacted on the 23rd October 2013.  The majority of its provisions have yet to be commenced but I expect to commence those sections this month in tandem with new Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) regulations prepared by the National Transport Authority (NTA).  These SPSV regulations will introduce new measures provided for under the Act, as well as consolidating and replacing the existing regulations.   </p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 legally underpins many of the actions recommended by the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011.  The aim of the 2011 Review was to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly by operating in a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced.  The 2013 Act provides a robust framework for the implementation of the key enforcement measures proposed under the Taxi Review, including making provision for a range of offences for contravention of the provisions of the Act and the regulations made thereunder, mandatory disqualification from holding a licence upon having a serious criminal conviction, a demerit system to deal with recurrent breaches of the SPSV regulations and powers for the NTA to enter into agreements with service providers for the purpose of increasing enforcement capacity and capability. </p><p>  In relation to the issue of a cost benefit analysis, I am advised that the NTA, which has responsibility for the regulation of the SPSV industry under the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, intends to conduct a fare review later this year and that as part of that review it will gather and publish information on driver income.  The Authority also publishes information on SPSV vehicle and driver licences which are an indicator as to whether the industry is expanding or contracting.  This should provide some assistance to persons considering market entry.</p></reply>

Indeed, Special Olympics Ireland has been the single largest beneficiary of core grant funding from the Irish Sports Council since 2007, receiving over &euro;16m between 2007 and 2014.  </p><p>  Special Olympics is about much more than sport.  It has wider benefits for people with an intellectual disability by contributing to their health, well-being, education and social inclusion.  I am aware that in Northern Ireland funding for Special Olympics is provided on a cross departmental basis.  I would support the implementation of a similar funding arrangement here in recognition of the wider benefits for people who participate in Special Olympics.  This is an issue which can be considered in the context of the development of a new Sports Policy Statement, which is underway in my Department.</p></reply>

In the context of the significance of the PSO route to the airport, just over 10% of all passengers using the airport last year travelled on the Kerry-Dublin route.  The policy on regional airports post 2014 is currently being developed in my Department.  This policy will reflect the recommendations arising out of the recently published IWA Knock Study Group, which are being incorporated into the draft National Aviation Policy and must also comply with the revised EU Guidelines on State-Aid, which were adopted by the Commission on 20 February 2014.</p><p>  No decisions have yet been made in respect of future PSO supports for the Kerry-Dublin or any other route at this stage.  It is intended that a PSO tender competition for the Donegal/Dublin and Kerry/Dublin routes will be organised for 2015.  As the Deputy appreciates, my Department cannot write a blank cheque and the final decision on whether or not to maintain PSO supports will only be taken when the outcome of the tender process is known. </p><p>  There is only a limited budget of some &euro;12m per annum available for the Regional Airports Programme post 2014, with an average cost per annum for the two PSO routes from Kerry and Donegal of over &euro;7.5m, based on existing figures.  Best use of that limited budget must be made in the context of maintaining and developing the four regional airports &ndash; Donegal, IWA Knock, Kerry and Waterford.</p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that total tourism employment (when other parts of the sector such as conferencing, attractions and festivals are included) is now approaching 200,000.</p><p>  Expectations across all areas of the tourism sector for 2014 are very positive.  In 2013, more than half of tourism businesses (54%) surveyed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland increased employment and, looking at anticipated growth in tourism for the year ahead, Failte Ireland estimates that employment in the sector could increase by between 6,000-8,000 in 2014.  This is based on projected overseas demand and trade sentiment for the coming season.  To help the industry grow earnings and jobs in 2014 and beyond, the Government has provided funding through F&aacute;ilte Ireland to deliver a programme of supports to tourism businesses, including developing visitor experiences, growing digital presence and increasing international sales.</p></reply>

The Government's current capital investment programme runs until 2016 and is necessarily limited by the State's financial circumstances.  The emphasis to date has been on the need to direct these limited resources to the maintenance and repair of existing infrastructure.  My key annual priorities, including investment priorities, over the last 3 years are published on my Department's website as are annual progress reports for each.  Further details of investments can be found in the Department's Annual Reports which are also published on the Department's website, .   </p><p>  The main investments in the transport sector come under the responsibility of the National Transport Authority, the National Roads Authority and, in respect of the national rail network, Irish Rail.  I have therefore referred the Deputies' questions on the detail of the specific projects in the current capital plan to the agencies for direct reply, including projects in the Cork region.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.   </p><p>  Consideration of a new Government capital investment plan beyond 2016 will begin shortly in association with the upcoming Capital Expenditure Review.  It is at only at this stage that priorities can be finalised.  In this context, work on a Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport is ongoing within my Department.  The completion of this work and its publication in 2014 is one of my priorities for this year.  This framework will allow us to identify the types of investment that can enhance economic productivity, but also recognise that meeting the needs of people is a critical aspect of transport infrastructure provision.  A steering group is guiding this work and stakeholders and advisers such as Forf&aacute;s have been involved in identifying the issues.  To ensure that wider stakeholder needs and concerns are fully addressed, a public consultation on a draft framework will take place this summer.</p><p>  In relation to the Dublin Mayor, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government consulted with my Department on the Statement attached to the Forum Report and my Department has given its views of the implications of the proposals.  Given the decision of Fingal County Council to block a plebiscite, the matter is now in abeyance.</p></reply>

The views raised and other relevant evidence and analysis are currently being considered, feeding into the drafting of the new policy which I aim to have finalised in the first half of this year.</p></reply>

Tenders sought from five shortlisted candidates were received by the NTA in February of this year.  The assessment of the tenders is due to be concluded shortly.  It is anticipated that construction of the bike schemes will commence shortly thereafter with the schemes becoming operational later this year. </p><p>  Funding  to meet the capital investment costs of public bikes in other cities has been identified within the 5-year capital allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures announced in 2012.  The delivery of the Regional Cities Bike Scheme was also dependent on  a separate process to explore the potential for a sponsorship contract to defray some of the costs associated with the introduction of the Scheme.  I was delighted to be able to report last September that Coca Cola emerged as the successful sponsor for the Scheme.</p><p>  The vision behind the Scheme is to develop an environmentally friendly means of public transport that is healthy, relatively inexpensive and will ensure an improved quality of life in each of the city's natural and built environment.  Public bike schemes have the potential to enhance the city centres and provide a significant boost to the development of a cycling culture.  They also add to the tourism offering in those cities.  It has been  over 4 years since the launch of Dublin Bikes.  It has been a resounding success with over 5 million rentals since its launch and 35,000 long term subscribers.  Dublin City Council has reported a 40% increase in numbers cycling in the city over the last four years.  I look forward to hearing of similar results when the bike schemes are up and running in Limerick, Cork and Galway.</p></reply>

The emphasis of the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) is on supporting culturally sensitive, frontline welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, with Britain being the focus of the greatest part of this support. These services have made a concrete difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas, reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their statutory entitlements locally.  Since 2003, the Emigrant Support Programme has provided more than &euro;114 million in grants to Irish community and voluntary organisations, of which &euro;86 million has been provided to more than 200 organisations in Britain.   This funding has been directed primarily at frontline welfare services, working to support those made vulnerable by health, age or dislocation. In 2013 approximately 80% of the grants paid in Britain were made to organisations providing welfare and information services to the Irish community.  The organisations funded provide a range of services from informal community networking groups for seniors, to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements. </p><p>  A substantial portion of ESP funding in Britain is provided to a number of organisations primarily focussed on helping those who have fallen on hard times by tackling the problems of homelessness and addiction.  These include Ashford Place (formerly Cricklewood Homeless Concern), the Safe Start Foundation in Middlesex, the London Irish Centre, the Luton Irish Forum and the NOAH Enterprise (Luton) in the London area and Monica's Place in Birmingham amongst others. </p><p>  Our support continues to evolve.  For example, in 2013, a grant was made to Console, the suicide prevention and bereavement service, to assist with the start-up costs of their new operation in Britain.  e introduction of services by Console around suicide prevention and suicide will complement services provided by other Irish organisations.</p></reply>

In this regard, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the details of the film tax relief scheme are contained in Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This is supplemented by the Film Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 357 of 2008) which govern the administration of the scheme. </p><p><b>Criteria to be fulfilled by a qualifying film company</b></p><p>  Under the provisions of section 481, an individual or company investing in a qualifying film, to be produced by a qualifying company, is entitled to claim tax relief in respect of that investment.  For this purpose, a qualifying company is an Irish incorporated and resident company, or a company which is carrying on a trade in the State through a branch or agency.  The company must exist solely for the production and distribution of one, and only one, qualifying film.  A film company seeking Section 481 finance cannot have in its name the words &quot;Ireland&quot;, &quot;Irish&quot;, &quot;Eireann&quot;, &quot;Eire&quot;, or &quot;National&quot;.</p><p>   In order to be regarded as a qualifying film, a film must meet the requirements of section 481 including criteria set out by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to the contribution which the production of the film is expected to make to, either or both of, the development of the film industry in the State and the promotion and expression of Irish culture.  On receipt of confirmation from the Minister that the film meets these criteria, the Revenue Commissioners then undertake a detailed examination of the application to ensure that the project complies with the other statutory requirements.  Where they are so satisfied, the Commissioners then issue a certificate in respect of the investments authorising tax relief in an amount not exceeding the lowest of:<blockquote>- eligible expenditure, which is generally the amount spent on the employment of eligible individuals and goods, services and facilities in the State,<br /><br />- 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or<br /><br />- &euro;50million.</blockquote><b>Verification and Auditing Procedures</b></p><p>  Prior to certification of a film, Revenue examine the application to ensure that:<blockquote>- the requirements of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 have been complied with;<br /><br />- contractual arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the production company has the rights to make the film;<br /><br />- the project appears to be commercially viable;<br /><br />- full budget details have been provided; and<br /><br />- declarations are received from the company directors that there are no issues that might impact upon the conditions for relief under S481. </blockquote>   Within 4 months of the completion of a film, a qualifying company is required to notify Revenue of the date of completion of the film and to provide 2 copies of the film to both Revenue and the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  At the same time, the company is also required to provide a compliance report to Revenue in relation to the film.  This compliance report contains, inter alia, a declaration from the directors of the production company confirming compliance with the conditions of the relief as well as a detailed line-by-line analysis of the budget for the film, identifying and giving reasons for any variations from the budget initially submitted.  These declarations must be accompanied by a declaration from an independent auditor who is also required to verify the amount spent on the film.</p><p>   All of the information submitted is examined by Revenue to ensure compliance with the section 481 requirements.  Where the certification of the film was made subject to specific conditions, Revenue will also examine the information to ensure that the company complied with the conditions.  In addition to the examination of compliance submissions, Revenue may also audit the returns of film producer and production companies as part of their normal audit activities.</p><p><b>Number of persons employed in the production of qualifying films</b></p><p>  Files maintained by the Revenue Commissioners provide data on the number of individuals who are scheduled to work on productions in a given year.  These show that in 2013, just over 27,000 individual employments were generated on film productions supported by Section 481 relief.  This includes approximately 20,000 employments as extras on these productions.  However, this data does not show whether an individual spent a full year, a week or a day working on the production of a qualifying film.  Similarly, an individual may have worked on a number of productions and would be counted in respect of each production.  For this reason, it is not possible to estimate the number of full-time equivalent employees from the Revenue information. </p><p><b>New Film Scheme</b></p><p>  The Deputy should also note that the Finance Act 2013 introduced changes to give Film Relief a new focus.  These changes are subject to a commencement order and, in the last Budget, I signalled my intention to bring the new arrangements into operation on 1 January 2015.</p><p>  Under the existing film relief scheme, an investor may claim tax relief in respect of an investment in a qualifying company.  The tax relief is granted at the investor's marginal rate of tax on the full amount of their investment.  Under the new provisions, the delivery mechanism of the incentive will change.  Relief will not, in the future, be available to investors in qualifying films.  Instead a payable Corporation Tax credit of 32% will be paid directly by the Revenue Commissioners to a Producer Company, who produces a qualifying film. </p><p>  The amount of the credit will be 32% of the lowest of:<blockquote> - eligible expenditure, which is generally the amount spent on the employment of eligible individuals and goods, services and facilities in the State,<br /><br /> - 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or<br /><br /> - &euro;50million.</blockquote>   The legislation provides for measures to ensure that, in the event that the qualifying company does not satisfy the statutory conditions or the conditions imposed by a film certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners, any amount paid by the Commissioners can be recouped.</p></reply>

Arrangements will be made during the year to provide for a new fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers which will have the same levels of support as the current excise relief scheme and there will be a seamless transition between the two schemes. The new fuel grant scheme will begin on 1 January 2015, following the discontinuation of the current scheme.</p><p>  As I have previously said, I intend that the new fuel grant scheme will have the same levels of support as the current excise relief scheme.  The current scheme provides a relief from excise duty for fuel used in a qualifying vehicle for the transport of a person with a disability up to a maximum of 2,728 litres in a 12 month period.  </p><p>   The eligibility and qualification criteria will remain as those provided for by the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 (S.I. No. 353 of 1994).

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-02a.157.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040200055#WRE02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 to 69, inclusive, together.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent Local Property Tax (LPT) data published by them is available on the Commissioners' website at: .  This covers statistics for both 2013 and 2014 (to February 2014).</p><p> In relation to Question No. 66, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the provision whereby liability for LPT in respect of residential properties valued at over &euro;1m is established by applying a rate of 0.18%<b></b>to<b></b>the first &euro;1m in value and 0.25% to the portion of the value above &euro;1m.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent data published by them shows that about 0.2% of properties have been valued for LPT purposes in excess of &euro;1m on a self assessment basis.  On that basis, it is estimated that some &euro;2.5m additional tax was collected for 2013 that is attributable to the 0.25% rate on that part of the property valuations in excess of &euro;1m.  It is reasonable to conclude that the final figure for 2014 is likely to be double the 2013 amount, however it is not possible to be definitive at this stage about amounts collected to date for 2014 at the 0.25% rate. </p><p>   Regarding Questions Nos. 67,68 and 69, as indicated in the Revenue Commissioner's statistics, there are about 18,700 properties where deferrals have been claimed and around 28,300 claims for exemptions among the returns processed to date.  These equate to about 1.2% and 1.8% of properties returned respectively.  These figures are primarily based on claims submitted by property owners in their LPT returns.  As the Deputy notes, earlier forecasts predicted that the level of deferrals and exemptions could be substantially higher.  These figures were estimated prior to the implementation of LPT.  While considerable effort may have been put into initial estimates of possible levels of exemption and deferral, the impact of the actual exemption and deferral provisions could not be accurately determined until the returns process has been completed. </p><p>   It should be noted that deferral is a personal choice issue for property owners and some, although they meet the conditions of deferral, may opt to pay the tax if their means allow it.  Consequently, even if the number of potential eligible cases were known in advance with accuracy, it would not have been possible to estimate the number that would actually apply for a deferral.</p><p>  Revenue estimates that the compliance rate for 2013 is currently at 93%.  It may be the case that some property owners have not claimed an exemption or a deferral on the misapprehension that they are automatically entitled to one.  It is important for property owners to be aware that they must apply for exemption from LPT or deferral as it will not generally be granted automatically and the Revenue Commissioners advise that this has been a key part of their communications message since the introduction of the tax.</p><p>   The Deputy will be aware that the deadline for property owners to bring their LPT affairs (including the Household Charge) up to date and avoid interest and penalties was 31 March 2014 and has now been extended to today.  I am advised by the Commissioners that their current priority is processing the large volume of Returns and payments received and they expect to publish more detailed data and analysis in due course.</p></reply>

A copy of the MART document can be accessed at . The targets cover both proposed and concluded sustainable solutions with respect to the lenders principal dwelling homes (PDH) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgagees.  Under this rolling process, quarterly performance targets have been set to the end of June 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgage arrears of more than 90 days in arrears.</p><p>  The Central Bank has indicated that all six mortgage lenders covered by the MART process have reported that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target for the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% target for the third quarter in 2013.  In particular, with respect to the third quarter 2013 target, which is the latest available data, the lenders have reported to the Central Bank they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears (PDH and BTL) against the 30% target.  As correctly stated by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance in the House last week, the MART process refers to both PDH and BTL mortgages.  While recent media reports described an individual bank's activities relating to the resolution of PDH cases, that is an operational matter for the individual bank, subject to the overriding requirement to achieve a sustainable solution to mortgages in difficulty.  In that context, if an individual bank considers that in a particular case that it is necessary and economically sensible to apply a debt compromise to a certain mortgage as part of an overall sustainable resolution, that will be a commercial matter for the individual bank.</p><p>  Regarding the particular approach taken by the individual bank mentioned, I understand that it will provide further information on this issue when it appears before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

A complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman may be made within three years of the complainant first becoming aware of the act giving rise to the complaint, even if this is longer than six years.  Whether both windows of complaint should be similar when both offices are amalgamated in line with the Government decision is a policy matter which will be decided when the legislation is being developed. Providing the necessary protection to the consumer over the longer term is of paramount importance. Therefore, the design of the appropriate mechanisms to achieve this is complex, as it involves a range of considerations, including the interface with the Statute of Limitations, existing consumer protection laws, complaints mechanisms and availability of records.</p></reply>

In order to address the risk of widespread abuse of the scheme, provision was made for certain restrictions on the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased.  Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that qualifying road transport operator.  Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that the oil traders are required to make to Revenue.</p><p>  In designing the scheme, I was conscious of the point raised by the Deputy.  Accordingly, the scheme provides that purchases of smaller quantities, by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue for that purpose, may also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way.  A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it with the information required about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card.  There are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.</p><p>  The purchasing arrangements under the scheme are necessary to enable Revenue to manage repayments to qualifying operators while controlling the risk of fraud.  The requirements of the scheme, including those relating to fuel purchases, were explained at length during meetings between Revenue and representative bodies of the transport operators prior to its commencement.</p></reply>

Preliminary findings of the third round of longitudinal testing, published by the ERC in December 2013 in a bulletin report entitled 'Changes in Pupil Achievement in Urban Primary Schools Between 2007 and 2013' shows continuing improvements for pupils in DEIS schools in both literacy and numeracy.  It is important that the gains are built upon because, while these findings are encouraging, they also show that average results in DEIS schools still fall below the national average.  Accordingly, a key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools identified as having the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  That challenge is significant, given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure which limits the capacity for any additionality to the DEIS programme.</p><p>  The estimated expenditure on the DEIS programme by my Department in 2014 is &euro;99million which includes funding on DEIS grants and additional teachers in DEIS schools.  Additional funding is provided by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for the School Meals Programme and the School Completion Programme respectively. </p><p>  I have no immediate plans to carry out a re-assessment of schools.  The current focus of my Department in relation to the DEIS programme is on its ongoing evaluation and on distilling the learning from this research in order to inform future policy on educational disadvantage.</p><p>Details of the number of schools built in towns with RAPID areas since the DEIS identification process is as follows:<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Roll No.</th><th>School</th><th>Year</th></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>91513S</td><td>Youghal Community School, Youghal</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>20295K</td><td>Carlow Town Educate Together</td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>20294I</td><td>North Drogheda Environs,Drogheda</td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>70650L</td><td>Athy Community  College</td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>19858V</td><td>Gaelscoil Dara, Galway Cit</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>17064U</td><td>Scoil Phadraig, Ballylinan, Athy</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>20259G</td><td>St. Francis' NS, Dundalk</td><td>2013</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Pupils with Down syndrome may receive additional teaching support in schools, either from a school's general allocation of Learning Support/Resource Teaching, or from an allocation of additional Resource Teacher hours to the schools from the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p><p>  Pupils who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools.  Many children with Down syndrome have access to such SNA support.  Other supports include provision for Assistive Technology support which can ensure that educational materials can be provided in accessible formats. </p><p>  With regard to the admissions process to schools, on 25th March, the Government approved the drafting of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014.  This new legislation aims to ensure that the enrolment process in all primary and post-primary schools is inclusive, transparent and fair.  Among the provisions in the new Bill, will be a requirement for all schools to make an explicit statement in their admissions policy that they will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability.</p><p>  In relation to admission to higher education, the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a college and university admissions scheme which offers places at reduced points to school leavers with disabilities.  Eighteen higher education institutions are currently participating in the scheme.  For further information on DARE see also www.accesscollege.ie. </p><p>  To assist pupils to then attend third level education, core funding for access programmes for pupils with disabilities is allocated each year as part of the overall budget of each designated higher education institution.  This funding supports the provision of dedicated staff, services and supports for students with disabilities.  Every further and higher education institution has at least one member of staff with responsibility for liaising with students with disabilities, as required by the Disability Act 2005.  In addition, many institutions have a dedicated Disability Support Service with trained disability officers, learning support officers and other specialist staff.  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) also provides additional funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities.</p><p>  With regard to alternative forms of testing and evaluation, I wish to advise the Deputy that secondary school students with special needs may have special arrangements made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate.  Candidates with disabilities, including Down syndrome, can apply through their school for reasonable accommodation during examinations.  Details of the reasonable accommodations that can be made for pupils with special educational needs is available at www.examinations.ie. </p><p>  In relation to standardised testing, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment guidelines on &quot;Assessment in the Primary School Curriculum &ndash; Guidelines for Schools&quot; provides general guidance for schools including on using alternative tests in relation to the standardised testing of pupils in primary schools.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the recent NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  An NCSE Working Group has been charged with developing proposals for a new allocation model.  Any changes to the current allocation model will therefore be considered in the light of the recommendations of the report of this Group.</p></reply>

My Department allocates significant  resources to ensure that pupils with special educational needs, including  pupils with Down syndrome, can participate fully in education.  Supports are  provided for schools in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified  professional teachers, Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, the appropriate  school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. </p><p>  In relation to initial teacher education, while special education has long been a feature of initial teacher education (ITE) programmes, the Teaching Council, the body with statutory authority and responsibility for the registration of teachers, requires the reconceptualised and extended Bachelor of Education  programmes which commenced in 2012, to address a number of specific elements including differentiation, inclusive education including special education and  literacy and numeracy.  The learning outcomes of these programmes indicate that the graduate teacher should be able to conduct a systematic, holistic  assessment of learner needs, to apply knowledge of the individual potential of  students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching, to set clear, challenging and achievable  expectations for pupils, to evaluate learner progress, to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant  outcomes.  Student teachers may also have access to additional elective courses with content focussing on special education. </p><p>  All primary teachers are qualified to teach in any primary or special school  classroom.  Teachers have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to continuing professional development.  My Department also funds a number of Post-Graduate Programmes for teachers involved in Learning Support and Special  Education.  These programmes are specifically designed to assist all schools and  educational services in meeting the needs of students requiring learning support and the teaching of students with special educational needs.  Since 2007, some 2,000 teachers have completed these programmes.  I am satisfied that current arrangements are adequate to ensure that teachers receive the necessary initial education and have access to quality continuous professional development programmes during their career so that they are in a  position to meet the needs of students.</p></reply>

It was recognised that the model concept was complex and multipurpose. It was determined that parents of children with autism should have three distinct choices available to them; their child could either attend a mainstream class in their local school with additional supports as required, they could attend a special class in a mainstream school or they could attend a special school. The Deputy will be aware that while some children with autism can thrive in a mainstream class, special classes have been specifically designed to meet the needs of those who require more intensive support. Special classes for children with autism in mainstream schools reflect the model A concept.</p><p>  Qualified primary teachers are equipped to teach special classes for children with autism. In addition my Department provides for a comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs including teachers of children with autism. Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS). </p><p>For the period between 2008 and 2010 teachers were appointed to new autism classes in advance of the class opening to facilitate CPD for the teachers in question. The CPD continues to be provided by SESS, but due to the smaller numbers of teachers requiring training the appointments are no longer made in advance. Funding is also made available through the SESS support scheme enabling teachers to identify their own CPD needs and attend appropriate and relevant courses not provided directly by the SESS.</p><p>  The SESS has a number of teams involved in the provision of CPD and support to teachers of students with challenging behaviour; the Challenging Behaviour Team, the Autism Team and the Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis Team. Thirteen members of the SESS are directly involved in these teams.  I am satisfied that SESS is making appropriate provision to support teachers and schools in this area.  The SESS has not consulted with the Division of Behaviour Analysis in this regard. Two full-time SESS team members hold a BCBA qualification with three others currently having post-graduate qualifications in this area.</p></reply>

Kerry such as outlined by the Deputy.  I have already made clear to the House on a number of occasions that school communities should have no reason to feel that there will be a forced closure of their local school.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less.  The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012.  The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014.  The phasing of these measures has provided the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  An appeals process is available to small schools which have had their staff number reduced as a result of the budget measure.  A school with four classroom teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the Budget 2012 measure can submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  Details on the appeals process are published annually as part of the staffing arrangements for primary schools which are set out in Circular 0007/2014 and available on the Department website.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p><p>  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures.</p><p>  I am mindful of the concerns of smaller schools and rural schools.  Our overall primary school enrolment has been growing rapidly in recent years and this is going to continue.  In managing the resource consequences of this, it is important that decisions on school provision and organisation are based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.</p><p>  Educational quality for the pupils has to be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  It is also necessary to consider the needs of local communities and of course there are wider social and cultural factors that need to be considered.  Given our population growth, we have increasing enrolment at all levels of education which is expected to continue in the medium term.  Many pupil places are required in areas that currently have no school provision at all and we have schools in areas of stable or declining population with relatively low pupil numbers.</p><p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review.  This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type.  I am currently considering this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.</p></reply>

The Council must also submit the relevant elements of its programme to each Department from whom funding will be made available for consideration of technical aspects of the proposed works.  When the Council's programme of coastal protection and flood defence projects is received by the OPW it will be reviewed having regard to related guidance issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the local authorities.  The OPW has written to the local authorities indicating that in order to assist them in a practical way and to avoid any potential cash-flow issues, it will consider requests for advance funding of up to 80% of the estimated cost of approved projects where a contract for works has been made.</p></reply>

This Report contains recommendations regarding the application of examinership to small and medium enterprises. </p><p>  Based on the recommendations of the CLRG, the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 was enacted in December 2013 which contains provisions designed to make the examinership procedure less costly for small private companies.  The Act provides for small private companies to apply directly to their local Circuit Court for the appointment of an examiner, rather than having to do so through the High Court.  These measures are due to be commenced shortly, following procedural issues being completed regarding the new Rules of Court to apply in the Circuit Court. </p><p>  It is my intention, as indicated in the D&aacute;il debate on the Deputy&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, that various issues in relation to examinership that were debated at that time, including CLRG recommendations, will be examined further to assess their viability.</p></reply>

This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the Union.  All such grants come from the exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding. </p><p>  During the Regional Aid Guideline process thus far, my Department has consulted relevant stakeholders including various Government Departments, the industrial development agencies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forf&aacute;s, the Central Statistics Office, the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, and the eight Regional Authorities. </p><p>  It will not be possible to include all regions in the map. Instead, qualifying regions up to a maximum of 51.28% of the total population can be included. My officials have compiled the most up to date economic data for each region and county, including Kerry, in order to determine which areas will qualify for inclusion in a revised Regional Aid Map for Ireland. Relevant data includes comparative unemployment levels and GDP by county.</p><p>  My Department has issued the proposed Regional Aid Map for Ireland to the Commission for consideration and approval. It would be inappropriate to disclose the contents of this submission until the Commission has finalised its consideration of the matter. </p><p>  It is important to note that all of the Country, including those areas not entitled to Regional Aid, can qualify for other forms of State investment e.g. Research &amp;amp; Development Aid, SME Investment Aid, Training Aid, and Aid for Environmental protection etc.</p></reply>

The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the client.  The market has changed considerably since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone, broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles.  In addition, the cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year with the number of eligible clients also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared with almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra clients became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. </p><p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is key in protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to preserve these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments.  Accordingly, the telephone allowance was abolished from 1 January 2014.   I am not in a position to reinstate the allowance. </p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department's clients and particularly those who are living alone. In Budget 2014, I was able to maintain the rate of the living alone allowance at &euro;7.70 per week.  While the decision to abolish the telephone allowance was a difficult one, it allowed my Department to fully maintain the other elements of the household benefits package, such as the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence. These are very valuable supports for clients. We have also maintained the value of the fuel allowance and free travel.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. The tenant's engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord. There is no contractual relationship established between the landlord and the Department.</p><p>  The Equal Status Acts 2000-2011, prohibit discrimination in the provision of services that are generally available to the public whether provided by the state or the private sector including lettings and accommodation. There are nine grounds prohibiting discrimination namely - gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, race, disability and membership of the Traveller community. Refusal by landlords to accept tenants, including those in receipt of rent supplement, under any of these grounds would be in breach of the equality legislation.</p><p>  The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation.</p><p>  A breakdown of rent supplement expenditure in Dublin by postal code is not available. </p></reply>

(For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.50%).  </p><p>  Self-employed workers may also access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would therefore be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. </p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. </p><p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  </p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.   It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources.</p><p>  The Group comprises County Managers from Monaghan and Cavan County Councils, the Director of Leisure, Development and Arts from Fermanagh District Council, representatives from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Strategic Investment Board, Waterways Ireland and senior officials from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Northern Ireland and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p><p>The Inter-Agency Group has met four times, last meeting on 9 December 2013.  The Group continues to examine leveraged funding opportunities for the project.  This includes the exploration of EU funding which may be potentially available in the next round of structural funds covering the period 2014 - 2020.  </p><p>  In the meantime, the Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis. Planning approvals have been received for the project in both jurisdictions. Compulsory Purchase Order land maps are in preparation and consideration is being given to how the construction work and other technical aspects of the project will be structured and the necessary lands secured.</p></reply>

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is primarily a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of commercial websites as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing-a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will also help the roll-out of high speed broadband as well as facilitating greater competition in the Irish market.</p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a total of 10 locations in County Longford, 19 locations in County Westmeath and 39 locations in County Kildare before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss these further with the Deputies concerned. </p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.

The uptake of the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) capacity under REFIT 3, launched in early 2012, will make a contribution to achieving this, along with migration to renewable heat in response to market forces. The requirements of Part L of the Building regulations are also expected to make a contribution to increasing the uptake of renewable heat. These measures and developments will build on the increases in renewable heat which were achieved by schemes such as the Greener Homes Scheme, the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and the CHP Deployment Programme.    My Department is also currently finalising a Bioenergy Strategy which will set out the actions required to optimise the contribution that energy from biomass can make to achieving Ireland's 2020 renewable energy targets. Analysis underpinning the strategy suggests that additional, targeted bioenergy measures can have a significant impact in the heat sector and recommendations will shortly be brought forward in this regard.</p><p>  I do not propose to introduce a grant scheme for the purchase of biomass stoves and boilers.</p></reply>

For client confidentiality reasons   the locations of the developments considered at this stage most likely to be candidates for clearance cannot be disclosed.   </p><p>Unless there are compelling reasons, primarily relating to public safety, the decision to clear all or part of an unfinished housing development is a matter for the owner/developer or funder acting in possession, usually acting through a receiver, and in the context of implementing a site resolution plan agreed with the l local a authority. Therefore, clearance is an intrinsic part of the asset management and disposal process by owners/developers/funders and will not normally require State intervention or funding.   </p><p>The National Co-ordination Committee will continue to liaise   with key stakeholders in monitoring progress in this area, including opportunities to address this cohort of developments through the normal resolution process where possible.</p></reply>

Where the proceeds of such a sale exceed the outstanding balance of the mortgage, consent is normally given by the lending institution concerned without undue delay. In such cases, it is usual for the vendor to obtain the required consent prior to the contract stage. The mortgage is usually discharged before completion and evidence of release must be provided on closing the sale.</p><p>  Where, on the other hand, it is clear that the proceeds of sale will not cover the outstanding balance of the mortgage, or may not do so, an intending vendor should make contact with the lending institution in advance of sale. In the case of certain commercial properties, the agreement of the National Asset Management Agency may be required. Such contact will provide the parties with an opportunity to discuss sale of the property and arrangements for discharging the mortgage, and thereby avoid the undesirable delays which frequently arise where no such advance contact has been made between them. While I am in principle well disposed to the introduction of improved arrangements to facilitate vendor sales of mortgaged property, such as the possible introduction of pre-approved consent to sale certificates as suggested by the Deputy, this is a matter which would, in the first instance, benefit from discussions between the Law Society and the lending institutions. I have therefore asked my Department to draw the attention of both the Law Society and the lending institutions to the Deputy's suggestion. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-02a.446.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040200069#WRT00900"><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got relatively early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.</p><p>  There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. As of 1 March 2014 waiting times for a first consultation were less than one month for all applicants at two law centres operating triage. On 1 March there were 112 people waiting at these centres representing 5% of the total numbers waiting for a first consultation at centres operating triage.</p><p>  While the Board aims for all applicants to receive a triage appointment within one month, in <i>O&rsquo;Donoghue v Legal Aid Board</i> ([2006] 4 IR 204) the High Court held that four months was not an unreasonable time for an applicant to wait for legal services. In eight centres operating triage waiting times for a first consultation are less than four months. Approximately 31% of the applicants who were waiting for a service at a law centre operating triage as of 1<sup></sup>  March will receive a service within four months. There are also four further centres that do not operate triage on the basis that their waiting time for a substantive appointment with a solicitor is under four months.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the Board operates a &ldquo;priority&rdquo; service in certain cases. Where a priority service is offered for the particular case type applicants are given the first available appointment with a solicitor. Details of the case types that are treated as priority are listed below. During February 2014, 15% of the total numbers who received a first consultation were given an early appointment on the basis of the matter being priority.</p><p>Priority is given to applicants seeking legal services in the following categories of cases:-</p><p>- child abduction proceedings; </p><p>- where there is a real danger of children being taken out of the jurisdiction without the consent of the applicant;</p><p>- proceedings on foot of Part IV of the Child Care Act 1991 or applicants presenting with cases that involve a risk of such proceedings; </p><p>- domestic violence;</p><p>- where a maintenance debtor has been served with a summons / warrant on foot of section 9A of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and  Children) Act 1976, has appeared in Court and has applied for civil legal aid having been advised of his/her entitlement to do so by the Judge;</p><p>- where, under the Statute of Limitations, there is a danger that the time limits for issuing proceedings may expire unless immediate action is taken;</p><p>- where there is a danger of time limits expiring; </p><p>- where there is a danger that assets may be reduced / disposed of so that they would be unavailable to meet the claims of the applicant; </p><p>- District Court and Circuit Court appeals, where the case has been dealt with through the private practitioner service and services are now being sought from the law centre;</p><p>- legal services for complainants in rape and certain sexual assault cases;  </p><p>- legal aid for persons in respect of whom a sex offenders order is being sought; </p><p>- where the other party&rsquo;s nationality, domicile or habitual residence enables them to seek a similar remedy in another jurisdiction and the applicant is likely to be prejudiced if he/she does not initiate proceedings first;</p><p>- asylum cases; and</p><p>- managing solicitors retain a residual discretion to provide a priority service in other cases where, having regard to the particular case concerned, as compared with other applications on the applications record, and to their own knowledge and experience, they consider that it is appropriate that a particular applicant be given specific priority over other applicants for legal services.</p></reply>

The Deputy's question specifically asked for "the fee rate for each fee type for senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors ...".  The question did not specify that what was requested were fee tables from the payments systems.  Following on from the reply to the question, the Deputy was sent lists of the rates payable as provided to my Department by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions where the fee rates are set.  Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) (Amendment) Regulations 1976 (S. I.

By way of reply I advised the Deputy that I was informed by the Financial Shared Services of my Department that its computer system is not programmed in such a way as to produce fee rate tables as requested.</p><p>  Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) (Amendment) Regulations 1978 (S. I. No. 33 of 1978) provide that fees for solicitors are calculated as a percentage of fees for counsel.  The list of rates paid to counsel received in my Department from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is forwarded to the Financial Shared Services to enable them to calculate payments to both counsel and solicitors.  This is the format in which information on the fees payable to counsel and solicitors under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is maintained in the Department.

The Irish Prison Service phone system keeps a log of all landline calls made to and from individual prisons and headquarters but this is a log only, containing data such as the number dialled from, number dialled, date and time of call, and duration.</p><p>  At present, the Prisoner Phone System records all prisoner calls with the exception of two call channels which are left unrecorded. These are channel 1 which is assigned to the prisoner&rsquo;s solicitor and channel 99 which is assigned to the Samaritans.  The prisoner is fully aware of the fact that they are recorded as his/her consent is given on his/her nomination form which he/she signs shortly after committal.  This is in accordance with rule 46 of the Prison Rules, 2007. </p><p>  On Tuesday 1 April, I was informed of an anomaly whereby 139 prisoners currently in custody had, or previously had, more than one solicitor on the Prisoner Phone System and who had their phone calls to the second solicitor inadvertently recorded as they were outside the restriction parameters that were then in place on the system.  This anomaly has potentially been in place since July 2010 when the current Phone System was introduced.  Since the introduction of this system, a total of 2,842 calls between a prisoner and a second solicitor have been recorded. 1,749 such calls relate to the 139 prisoners currently in custody who have or who previously had a second solicitor listed on the system. </p><p>  In these cases, and with immediate effect, the Irish Prison Service took steps to ensure that all previously recorded calls were made inaccessible to staff members.  In addition, action was immediately taken on the Prisoner Telephone System to prevent staff adding multiple solicitors to the system.  An interim measure has been put in place to deal with this matter and it is expected that a permanent solution will be in place within a number of weeks.</p><p>  I can further advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service have confirmed that the content of any of the inadvertently<font color="#004080"> </font>recorded phone calls has never been made available to any third party including any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In order for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to get copies of any recorded phone conversations by prisoners, they need to firstly make an application at Superintendent level to the Irish Prison Service providing the specific details and reasons that they require same.  The Irish Prison Service have categorically stated that they have never approved the provision of a copy of a prisoner&rsquo;s phone calls to his/her solicitor to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under any circumstances.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service intends to write to the solicitors of the prisoners who are affected to inform them of this situation and to apologise for the inadvertent recording of the calls. </p><p>  Finally, I have asked the Inspector of Prisons to carry out an urgent independent investigation into all the circumstances surrounding the recording of telephone conversations between prisoners and their solicitors.  The Inspector has been asked to carry out his investigation pursuant to section 31 of the Prisons Act, 2007 and to submit his report to me as soon as possible.  The Inspector&rsquo;s report will be published.</p></reply>

In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer's entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer's Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. </p></reply>

Work on that Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and the allocation of funds by the Commission, so given the likely adoption date of June, the Programme is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  I am working closely with all stakeholders in developing the Programme.

While the administrative functions are being transferred from that office to the Castlebar office, the Department's vets, inspectors and technical officers remain in place to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from these offices.  I am satisfied that frontline services can be fully maintained with current staffing levels and that public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available in the Enniscorthy office.</p><p>  The transfer of these functions arises from an extensive review of the local office structure which was carried out by the Department over the last number of years.  This review concluded that, arising from the investment in technology and the substantial reduction in disease levels in recent years, significant efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of administrative functions in two centres, thereby giving rise to significant scope for redeployment of administrative staff from existing local offices.  The process of centralising the administrative functions commenced in 2012 and is on-going.</p><p>  In line with Government policy, the Department has actively sought redeployment opportunities for administrative staff in local offices.  Redeployed staff have already been transferred from the local offices in Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford and Tullamore as well as Enniscorthy to other Departments and agencies such as Revenue Commissioners, Department of Justice and the Shared services areas of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to enable those bodies to provide important services such as property tax, Garda Vetting etc.</p></reply>

The enactment, through the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, of amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 underpins a number of key reforms being introduced as part of the Pre-School Quality Agenda.  To provide for the implementation of the changes to the Act it will be necessary to amend or make additions to the current Regulations in a number of areas, and these are currently being considered.  Following the introduction of the Child and Family Agency Act 2014 the inspection of pre-schools and the enforcement of the Regulations are now the responsibility of the new Child and Family Agency. </p><p>  Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides for exemptions to the requirements of Part VII of the said Act, including childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families, who are not subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006.   This exemption recognises parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  Such childminders are encouraged to voluntarily register their service with their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both registered and voluntarily registered childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts childminding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax. My Department will continue to actively promote the voluntary registration of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes. However, the Department is not in a position to prevent parents from entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations.</p><p>  Childcare services subject to the Regulations are required to obtain Garda vetting for all childcare workers.  Work on the development of Ireland's first Early Years Strategy for children aged up to 6 years is underway in my Department. The issue of how best to regulate the childminding sector is being considered as part of this process. It is expected that the Strategy will be finalised later this year.</p></reply>

Following this decision, a review was carried out of the previous plan for a paediatric ambulatory and urgent care centre on the campus of Tallaght Hospital, and following that review, I announced in January this year that satellite centres of the main hospital would be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  These satellite centres will be an integral part of, and come under the governance of, the new children's hospital.  The centres will provide services and environments of the same quality as those delivered in the new children's hospital and staff working in the satellite centres will rotate through the main hospital.  In advance of the opening of the new children's hospital, the satellite centres will be managed as part of the Children's Hospital Group.</p><p>  The decision to develop the hub-and-spoke model of a main hospital with satellite centres is based on the need to provide high quality, safe, accessible acute and secondary general care to the children of the Greater Dublin Area.  These two satellite centres will each provide urgent care, to be established well in advance of the main hospital opening.  Each centre will also provide secondary outpatient services including rapid access general paediatric clinics.  This configuration improves geographic access to urgent care for a significant number in the Greater Dublin Area, supports primary and community care paediatrics and significantly reduces Emergency Department and outpatient attendance on the main site.  All other services will be provided on the main site at the St James's campus including all in-patient care. </p><p>  The satellite centres are expected to be  built by mid-2016, enabling them to become operational well in advance of the transition of services to the main hospital on the St James's campus, which is expected to commence at the end of 2018.</p></reply>

Under the Haddington Road Agreement, nurses participating in the Nurse Graduate Programme are paid 85% of the starting pay of a Staff Nurse in the first year and 90% in the second year.  In addition these nurses would also be in receipt of allowances and  other premium payments. </p><p>  A major objective of the programme is to put in place more cost-effective service delivery arrangements, having regard to the high rates of expenditure on agency staffing and overtime. The scheme will enable the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurse positions for two years, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited. Therefore it supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.</p></reply>

The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) provides some emergency capacity in the greater Dublin area, as well as non-emergency patient transport.  </p><p>  The ongoing development of pre-hospital emergency care involves a range of initiatives, including the development of a single national control and dispatch system for the State.  This new system, expected to be completed in 2015, will deploy all emergency ambulance resources in the State, including emergency ambulances, rapid response and intermediate care vehicles, first responders, aeromedical services and ambulances in Dublin. </p><p>  In the context of the development of the national control system, the Dublin City Manager and the HSE's Chief Operating Officer have commissioned a joint review of DFB ambulance services in Dublin City and County.  The review will consider all aspects of ambulance operations provided by DFB within the Dublin area, including the capacity and capability of ambulance services.  </p><p>  The review will inform consideration of the best model for provision of emergency medical services in the greater Dublin area.  It is part of the process of ensuring a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology, so that emergency pre-hospital care can continue to modernise and services can be delivered in an appropriate and timely manner, to the benefit of patients.</p><p>  There has been speculation about this review and I am aware of the concerns expressed by some about the future of the service.  I want to assure those concerned that I fully appreciate the service the Fire Brigade provides. This review is not a negative reflection on that service. It is being conducted in parallel with the HIQA review of the National Ambulance Service and the NAS capacity review.  The intention behind all of these reviews is to examine our pre-hospital emergency care services throughout the country, with a view to identifying the best way to enable them to meet the challenges of the future.  I look forward to the recommendations of all three reviews, which I am certain will enable us to ensure that we provide a service capable of delivering the best possible outcomes for the public.</p></reply>

However I am concerned that in the year 2013 there was an increase in road deaths from 2012.</p><p>  I meet regularly with all of the bodies and agencies that have responsibility for road safety, including the Garda&iacute; and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to ensure that all necessary measures are identified and taken to improve safety on our roads.</p><p>  I launched the Road Safety Strategy 2013 to 2020 last year. This contains 144 Actions to be implemented by the various agencies involved in order to build on the previous Strategies with the objective of improving safety, sustainably on our roads and making Ireland among the safest countries for road safety.</p><p>  Aside from the Strategy, the Road Traffic Act 2014, was signed into law by the President on 25th February.  This legislation introduces measures which will further contribute to road safety in the years to come. The Act provides for further Graduated Driver Licensing measures, adjustments to the penalty points system, increasing demerits for the most dangerous offences such as speeding and operating a mobile phone while driving and new measures to combat intoxicated driving.</p><p>  My officials are also in the early stages of drafting the Road Traffic Bill 2014 which will contain further measures to improving safety on our roads.</p><p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is funded through a combination of Exchequer and non-Exchequer funding.  The RSA Exchequer allocation for 2014 is &euro;3.37 million, which represents 5% of its projected income for the year.

My aim is to maintain this momentum this year and early indications are positive in this regard.  Overseas visits for December 2013 to February 2014 were up by 11% compared to the corresponding period a year earlier.</p><p>  The approved Tourism Ireland Business Plan for 2014 target growth in visit numbers to Ireland of a further 4% this year and growth in associated visitor revenue of 7%.  Priority overseas markets will again be the United States, Great Britain, Germany and France, which together deliver almost three-quarters of all our overseas visitors but promotions will also continue in other markets.  </p><p>  Tourism Ireland, working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is placing a major focus on  highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way this year.  It will also promote key events, including the visit of the Giro d&rsquo;Italia, and the Croke Park Classic American football game.  I am confident that other measures such as the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the reduction of the air travel tax to zero, and the increased air access to Ireland will also help to ensure that the targets are met.  Given the growth levels targeted for 2014 and the occupancy levels across all accommodation types I am satisfied that, while there may be some pressures in some areas during periods of peak demand, there is generally sufficient capacity to meet the growth anticipated.   </p><p>  Some of the positive legacies of The Gathering include the fact that all of the increased air capacity secured for the year of The Gathering has been retained for 2014 with a number of additional routes confirmed.  Furthermore, many of the events which were initiated in 2013 will be repeated while the experience gained by using the community activation process and local authorities has provided many lessons which could be applied in future projects.</p></reply>

An integrated and co-ordinated transport system is an important consideration when it comes to future decisions on transport investment.  In making decisions as to future expenditure, my Department has been active to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken and that we do not look at land, maritime or aviation transport in isolation from each other. My Department is also considering a Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport to ensure that investment decisions in the transport sector will in future have a much more rigorous evidence base than was the case in the past and to enable us to prioritise the projects that offer the greatest economic and social return.    </p><p>  At a European level, my Department has been and will continue to actively engage with the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T) and to ensure it is integrated into Irish transport policy making.  The TEN-T regulations set out a multi-modal transport network across the European Union and aim to ensure integration between the various modes.  This multi-modal EU policy is supported by domestic policy such as the new National Ports Policy that I launched in March 2013.  For example the National Ports Policy's designation of Shannon-Foynes Port, Dublin Port and the Port of Cork as Ports of National Significance (Tier One) and Rosslare Europort and the Port of Waterford as Ports of National Significance (Tier Two) mirror the TEN-T designations of these ports as Core and Comprehensive ports on the TEN-T network.  These designations are then taken into account by the National Transport Authority and the National Roads Authority when decisions are being made in terms of future planning.</p><p>  Other policy work is ongoing in my Department and I expect to publish two significant new transport policy papers in 2014. An aviation policy is now approaching completion while in relation to land transport, work is ongoing on a strategic framework for investment in land transport.  Both the framework for investment and the aviation policy will help clarify transport priorities and will help to ensure that there is appropriate co-ordination and integration between the various modes.  In a similar vein, the National Transport Authority have a statutory remit to develop an integrated transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and I will soon be launching the NTA&rsquo;s Integrated Implementation Plan which sets out their programme of investment and development in the Greater Dublin Area for the next five years.</p></reply>

As an island nation, with a peripheral location, access infrastructure is of vital strategic importance to the Irish economy.  Irish airports have a critical role in supporting economic development by facilitating trade, tourism and inward investment.  Foreign direct investment continues to be a key driver of the Irish economy and the proximity of a well connected airport continues to be an essential factor when a multinational company decides on location.  Recognition of the importance of connectivity to the Irish economy was one of the main reasons this Government prioritised the cutting of the air travel tax to zero.  This action, which was announced as part of Budget 2014 and came into effect yesterday was designed to generate additional air capacity and services to Ireland for the business and tourism sectors.  I am very pleased to see there has already been a very positive response to this announcement.  Both Irish and foreign airlines announced 34 new routes/services at Irish airports for the 2014 season.  My focus as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is to encourage airlines and our airports to generate even more direct air services into Ireland in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Over 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s trade moves by sea and there are currently 22 shipping operators providing a mixture of daily to weekly scheduled shipping services from Ireland. This includes companies providing year round scheduled passenger services between Ireland and the UK and France. </p><p>  It is important to note that all shipping companies servicing routes to and from Ireland are commercial companies.  Any new initiatives to enhance services are market driven, as it is not government policy to fund international shipping services as this would be contrary to EU State Aid and Competition law.</p><p>  Activity in the sector proved positive last year. Irish shipping and port activity rose by 3% in the third quarter of 2013 when compared to the corresponding period of 2012, according to the latest figures produced by the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO). In terms of passengers, figures in 2013 show that ferry passenger numbers travelling to and from Ireland increased by 1%  when compared to 2012. In 2014,  Irish Ferries introduced a new direct passenger car ferry service linking Dublin with Cherbourg while another company  LD Lines announced a new passenger and freight ferry service linking Rosslare with the French port of St Nazaire and the Northern Spanish port of Gijon. </p><p>  Competition in the ferry sector is encouraged and I expect services to continue to develop and expand to meet any increased market demands in the future.  My Department through the IMDO works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also involved in active promotion and marketing of sea access routes to Ireland in their role of promoting Ireland as a high quality and competitive tourist destination.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Mission Statement is to ensure that the transport, tourism and sport sectors make the greatest possible contribution to economic recovery, fiscal consolidation, job creation and social development.  In a separate reply to a Parliamentary Question by the Deputy today, I have set out the measures in place to ensure the integration and coordination between land, air and sea transport so that all contribute to the achievement of the mission statement. </p><p>  I published my priorities for 2014 on my Department&rsquo;s website earlier this year. It can be seen from these priorities, and from priorities set out and achieved in the previous 3 years, that linkages and opportunities between the transport, tourism and sports sectors are identified and exploited.</p><p>  In tourism this year, we will build on the achievements of 2013 and focus on increasing visitor numbers to Ireland. The latest CSO figures show very strong growth in revenue from overseas visitors last year and confirm that tourism is playing a significant role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and has directly contributed to the maintenance and creation of new jobs in the tourism sector over 2013.  I plan to build on this and am aiming to grow visitor numbers by 4% and tourism revenue by 8% over 2014. There will be a strong focus on sports tourism and outdoor tourism with the Giro d&rsquo;Italia, Croke Park Classic and the Wild Atlantic Way.</p><p>  As of yesterday, the Government delivered on its commitment to reduce the air travel tax to zero. The commitment was based on airlines being willing to increase capacity on our key access routes. The airlines have responded with new flights into Ireland and increased capacity on existing routes.  </p><p>  My priorities also include a new motorway in the West, commencement of works on the Luas Cross City Project, laying the foundations for our bid for the Rugby World Cup, starting on the National Indoor Arena at the National Sports Campus in Dublin, and making new allocations for facilities and equipment under the Sports Capital Programme. </p><p>  My Department has inputted to the development of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs and we will ensure that we deliver on our commitments within it. In developing the Action Plan, the Government is taking not just a short term view of job creation but is also laying the foundation for structures that facilitate and support longer term sustainable job creation opportunities. My Department is doing likewise.</p></reply>

From 415 deaths on our roads in 2001, we have seen a dramatic reduction to 190 deaths in 2013. </p><p>  However, we must continue to implement measures and take further initiatives that will lead to even safer roads.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is responsible for the provision of public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area and the regional cities.  The NTA provides funding to local authorities for a range of schemes to benefit cyclists, including the provision of infrastructure, and other measures to improve safety for commuters under the Sustainable Transport Management Grants Programme.  We will continue to encourage cycling as a healthy and environmentally friendly mode of travel.</p><p>  At the same time, we recognise that cyclists and pedestrians are particularly vulnerable road users.  The current Road Safety Strategy, which runs from 2013 to 2020, contains a number of measures to ensure greater safety in cycling and pedestrian activities.  These include: education to promote use of personal protection equipment and high visibility clothing; developing a standardised road safety cycling proficiency training programme for schools; and evaluating the cost-benefit of reducing VAT on personal protection equipment. My Department and I will work with the RSA and the other appropriate bodies to ensure that these recommendations are implemented.</p></reply>

The M50 upgrade project, approved in 2005, resulted in the addition of a third lane in both directions from the M1 to Sandyford and a fourth auxiliary lane in places together with the development of freeflow junctions and the introduction of barrier free tolling.  This major investment has significantly enhanced the capacity of the motorway.  There are no proposals at present for further investment in additional capacity.  One of the conditions attached to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's approval of the upgrade was the publication of a scheme of demand management measures within three years of the completion of the work.  The NRA with the relevant local authorities has been working on such a scheme and a draft of their report has been published.</p><p>  Regarding the overall position in respect of future transport investment and capacity constraints I wish to advise that my Department is currently drafting a Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport (SFILT).  The preparation of the Framework will have regard to various transport objectives including the need to obtain best value for money through the timely maintenance and renewal of existing infrastructure and ensuring the best use of existing assets, improving the economic evaluation methodology for investment in new capacity to address or pre-empt bottlenecks, ensuring that the transport system is as safe as possible, promoting improved quality of life taking account of affordability considerations, accessibility and enhancing the public realm and improving integration of the transport system in both inter-modal and intra-modal terms.</p></reply>
