    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-21a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100073#WRA00800"><p>Arising from recent talks between the Government and public sector staff representative bodies, the draft Public Service Stability Agreement was finalised on 8th June 2017.  It applies across the public service as a whole.  It contains a specific commitment with regard to recruitment and retention in certain parts of the public sector.  Under this commitment, the Agreement sets out a process for a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in certain sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident.  This would include the health sector.  There will be opportunities for submissions to be made to the Public Service Pay Commission and the exercise is due to be completed by the end of 2018.  Any proposals will be subject to discussion between the parties.  Also, the agreement provides for a series of salary increases over the coming years and a number of health-related allowances will be restored, provided the relevant staff representative bodies accept the Agreement.  These measures should assist in recruitment and retention of staff in the public sector generally. </p>  <p>  In the broader context, there has been a significant improvement in the staffing of the public health services in the past three years as the economic position has improved and additional funding has been made available to support service delivery. Total numbers employed have increased from end April 2014 to end April 2017 by over 10,000 whole time equivalents to 111,979.</p>  <p>  The number of consultants has increased significantly. At the end of April 2017 there were 2,884 whole time equivalents. This constitutes an increase of 298 whole time equivalents since April 2014. The number of NCHDs has increased very significantly, from 4,982 at the end of April 2014 to 6,092 at the end of April 2017, an increase of 1,109.  These additional posts are supporting increased service delivery and improved compliance with the European Working Time Directive.  </p>  <p>  Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of April 2017 stood at 36,549 whole time equivalents, having increased by 625 whole time equivalents in the 12 months from end April 2016 and by 1,870 in the three years from end April 2014 to end April 2017.  Overall nursing numbers are at the highest level since 2011 with numbers increasing consistently since early in 2014.   It is acknowledged, however, that vacancies remain in the system and there was a significant fall in numbers between 2007 and 2014 due to the economic downturn. </p>  <p>  I can also advise that, under proposals formulated at the Workplace Relations Commission between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU in February and March this year, it was agreed that management would increase the nursing and midwifery workforce in 2017, through a broad range of initiatives that provide for 1,208 additional permanent posts. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-21a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100073#WRA01000"><p>As Deputies are aware, immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions. It is a recognised simple and safe way of protecting people against harmful diseases such as meningitis, measles, mumps and rubella and influenza.  The importance of vaccination is acknowledged by all the major international health organisations, particularly the World Health Organisation.  While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority assesses the safety of medicines in Ireland and as Minister I can assure you and the public that the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects. </p>  <p>  I am very disappointed that the uptake of certain vaccines, which have been the subject of recent campaigns, has dropped. Most notably HPV vaccine uptake rates have fallen from 87% in 2014/15 to 72%  in 2015/16. This is a very serious development as a large number of girls are now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.  My Department and the HSE are working to counter the misinformation concerning vaccines that are undermining our national vaccination programmes.  We must ensure that the public and healthcare providers have full information regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccination programmes.  The HSE is implementing a strategy aimed at increasing vaccine uptake.  An example of this was seen at the recent National HPV Vaccine Conference where the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and the work to increase uptake by girls as part of the Schools Immunisation programme was outlined.  I attended this Conference to not only demonstrate my support but also to clearly outline the priority my Department is placing on vaccine uptake in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I regularly speak publically and use social media to highlight this issue. You will also be interested to note that the forthcoming National Healthcare Quality Reporting System has a key focus on childhood vaccines. Information on uptake rates and safety is provided for the MMR, meningococcal C, seasonal influenza and the HPV vaccines.  This Annual Report will be published by my Department later this month.</p></reply>

In the first instance they bring together HSE staff who in many cases have previously been operating from older, more dispersed locations.  They are intended to facilitate more integrated working by primary and social care staff in the HSE and general practitioners as members of primary care teams and networks, particularly in relation to the care of people with more complex needs.  These centres provide scope, over time, for more comprehensive services to be provided in the community, such as structured care of people with chronic illness, an enhanced range of diagnostic services and potentially a range of specialist services on an outreach basis.</p><p>To date, 100 Primary Care Centres are already operational which has significantly enhanced the accessibility of health services in local communities. An additional 27 Primary Care Centres are expected to be operational in 2017 and 2018.  There are a further 10 locations where primary care infrastructure is under construction or at advanced planning and<b></b>51 locations which are at preliminary stages of development.</p><p>With regard to the new Summerhill Primary Care Centre, construction is due to be completed in Quarter 2 of  2018 and services are expected to commence in Quarter 3 the same year.  The Centre will be the base for the Summerhill Primary Care Team and the Inns Quay Primary Care Team.  In addition, it will be the base for all Network Primary Care services covering the North Inner City. </p><p>The following services will be located in the new Summerhill Facility:-</p><p>- General Practice Services</p><p>- Public Health Nursing/Community Nursing Services</p><p>- Occupational Therapy Services, Physiotherapy Services, Speech &amp;amp; Language Services</p><p>- Psychology Services</p><p>- Dietetic Services</p><p>- Social Work Services</p><p>- Home Help Services</p><p>- Mental Health Day Hospital Services</p><p>- Early Intervention and School Age Services for children with disabilities</p><p>- Meeting and administration accommodation</p><p>- Ambulance Services (located on the site in a separate building).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-21a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100073#WRA01400"><p>A key recommendation of the <i>2014 Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  The report also concluded  that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  Therefore, medical card provision is solely based on financial assessment.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card. </p><p>However, in the assessment of applications the HSE seeks, within the framework of the legislation, to exercise discretion.  In that regard the HSE assesses the financial, social and medical circumstances of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. This assessment informs the decisions taken by the HSE on whether to award a medical card on a discretionary basis.</p><p>Also, on foot of the Expert Panel's Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of the medical card system.  This Group has been working on the development of an assessment form which will seek to capture the additional financial costs associated with an illness, including cancer, and which will assist the HSE in exercising its discretion. The Group also made a recommendation in 2015, which was accepted by the Director General of the HSE, to award a medical card to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.  The card will be held for 5 years to cover the average period of the acute illness, treatment and recovery.</p></reply>

However, the numbers of patients who had completed their acute treatment but required home-care in order to be discharged was very high in the early part of the year.  Without additional funding this could not have been sustained and the allocations for the rest of the year would have had to be reduced.</p><p>Government responded to this challenge by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  Further resources were provided through the Winter Initiative, in particular extra home care packages and an increase in approvals for transitional care beds.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of 10.57 million Home Help Hours, 16,750<b></b>Home Care Packages<b></b>and<b></b>190<b></b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs.  While the January to April data for home help hours is less than the corresponding period in 2016, of more significance is that the HSE target for this year is to provide about 443,545 home help hours in Sligo/Leitrim. This is an increase of 10,478 hours  on the number delivered in 2016.  In relation to Home Care Packages, 304 people were in receipt of a Home Care Package in the Sligo/Leitrim region in April 2017, an increase of 4% on the expected target of 293 people.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-21a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100073#WRA01800"><p>In February 2016, the Health Research Board (HRB) was engaged to conduct a comprehensive review of international public funding models for assisted human reproduction (AHR). The HRB evidence review is now complete and was published simultaneously on the Department of Health&rsquo;s and the HRB's websites on Wednesday 15 March 2017. </p>  <p>  This evidence review from the HRB examines the public funding mechanisms for AHR in different countries. The review looks at the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The review does not indicate a recommendation or preference for a specific funding model; rather it outlines the pros and cons of such funding models, the different aspects of models in different jurisdictions, as well as the different rationales underpinning such funding models. </p>  <p>  The HRB evidence review will be analysed by officials in my Department in the context of considering policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment. It should be noted that, any funding model that might ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework relating to AHR.</p>  <p>  While IVF treatment is not currently provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

This funding stream ended in 2015 with the publication of the National Strategy &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo; in 2015. The ending of the Community Resilience Funding stream after 2015 was communicated to all of the recipients of the funding, including Good2Talk.

However delays arose, and in February 2017 the Hospital was advised that the candidate was no longer in a position to take up the post.</p>  <p>  In light of the importance of this post, it has been re-advertised by the Public Appointments Service as a priority, and applications have now been received.  The HSE is actively engaging with the Public Appointments Service in order to fill this critical post as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  In the interim, the Saolta Healthcare Group has been making every effort to provide appropriate diabetes care services to paediatric patients. Children under the age of 12 years are currently referred to University Hospital Limerick for diabetes treatment, while patients aged 12 years and over are commenced on insulin pump therapy under the guidance of a consultant endocrinologist at GUH.</p>  <p>  The Saolta Healthcare Group has advised that it is committed to urgently recruiting a permanent paediatric diabetes consultant to Galway University Hospital in order that the Hospital can provide comprehensive paediatric diabetes services, so that children do not have to travel to hospitals outside the Hospital Group.</p></reply>

However, Dr Herity recommended additional investment to increase capacity at the hospital.  In that regard, an additional &euro;0.5m funding was provided to University Hospital Waterford in 2017 to enable the hospital to provide two additional cath lab sessions per week.  This entails an additional eight hours provision per week or a 20% expansion in operating hours.  The cath lab will now be funded to provide 12 sessions i.e. 48 hours activity per week.  It is expected that this capacity will facilitate the provision of an increased volume of scheduled cardiology care at the hospital.  </p>  <p>  On 23 January last, I asked the HSE to develop a Cardiology Waiting List Initiative, noting that such an initiative could include the deployment of a mobile cath lab for specific periods in specific locations.  On 18 May, I requested that the HSE maximise the benefit for patients from the &euro;0.5m funding allocated for University Hospital Waterford, in respect of both additional sessions at the existing cath lab and the temporary use of a mobile cath lab for a specific period.  The Deputy may wish to note that on 12 June last, the HSE was approved by my Department to issue a tender, within one week, for the provision of a temporary mobile cath lab at the hospital.  The lab will be procured in line with the normal HSE procurement process.  The mobile cath lab will be funded from time related savings relating to the additional funding provided to the hospital on foot of the Herity report. </p>  <p>  I should also mention that following a targeted initiative, there has been a significant improvement in waiting times for cardiology procedures at the hospital.  The most recent data from the NTPF, which is for May 2017, indicates that a total of 296 patients are waiting for a cardiology in-patient/day case procedure, with 189 of those waiting less than 3 months.  The HSE has advised that no patient will be waiting longer than 6 months for a cardiology procedure at University Hospital Waterford by the end of August.</p></reply>

A draft Public Service Agreement was reached on 8 June 2017 and is currently being considered by the unions in the context of the public servants they represent.</p>  <p>  Any disparities that exist between section 38 and section 39 organisations are due to the fact that they are very different entities. Organisations that are funded under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 provide a defined level of health and personal social services on behalf of the HSE.  These section 38 agencies include both acute and non-acute organisations.  The employees of bodies that are funded under Section 38 are classified as public servants.  They are subject to the standard salary scales for the health sector and have access, in the main, to public service pension schemes. These employees are also included in public service employment numbers. </p>  <p>  On the other hand, Section 39 agencies are agencies where the HSE provides a grant to allow the agency to provide services similar or ancillary to the HSE.  The governance context in which the HSE engages with section 39 agencies is distinctly different from that which applies in the case of section 38 agencies.  For example, the employees of section 39 agencies are not public servants, are not members of public sector pension schemes and, unlike their section 38 counterparts, are not directly bound by the Department of Health consolidated pay scales.  </p>  <p>  As the HSE and the Department of Health have no role in the pay rates or terms and conditions of the staff employed by these section 39 agencies, it is a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.</p></reply>

However,  in order to address the anomalies which arose following the Labour Court Recommendation for certain Garda Associations, the Government agreed to bring this date forward to 1 April 2017 for those civil and public servants who did not stand to benefit from this Labour Court Recommendation.

As part of its report, the Committee has made a series of recommendations in relation to the organisation, leadership and governance structures in our health system, including the potential role for regional bodies to support integrated care. </p>  <p>  I have been clear since the cross-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare commenced the development of a long term vision for Ireland's healthcare system that I would not advance major structural reforms until it had reported out of respect for the process. The Committee has now completed its work and I would like to commend it on the significant achievement of developing a future vision, based upon political consensus, for our health services. </p>  <p>  The report is the culmination of a year-long process of unprecedented cross-party collaboration, dialogue and engagement and is testament of the desire across the political spectrum and across the broader stakeholder community to work collaboratively to address the challenges in the health service. It is vital that we now allow time to reflect and deliberate on the findings of the Committee. I look forward to the forthcoming D&aacute;il debate on the report and I will give full consideration to the report&rsquo;s recommendations when I have had the opportunity to hear views from across the D&aacute;il. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach was very clear in his speech to the D&aacute;il last week that delivering real improvements in our health services is a key priority for this Government. He has tasked me with preparing a detailed response to the report including proposed measures and timelines. It is my intention to do so following the D&aacute;il debate and I hope to bring detailed analysis and proposals to Government quickly. I have no doubt that the report will be an essential reference point for all Governments and parties in the fundamental reform of our health services over the next decade.</p></reply>

Doctors therefore have existing powers in exceptional circumstances.  </p>  <p>  The Expert Group Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 which was published in 2015 recommended that there should be greater &lsquo;proactive encouragement for the patient at all stages to involve his/her family/carer and/or chosen advocate in the admission process and in the development of the care and treatment plan with the patient&rsquo;s consent&rsquo;.  The Group did not recommend that family involvement in the care and treatment of patients be made compulsory.  There are some serious downsides to consider in terms of taking an absolute approach where those with mental illness may decide not to confide in their Doctor/medical team if they are strongly against involving family members for whatever reason.</p>  <p>  Following on from the Expert Group Review, the Mental Health Commission wrote to all of the Executive Clinical Directors of mental health services reminding them of the enormous importance of involving family members as appropriate in accordance with the Commission&rsquo;s Code of Practice on Admission, Transfer and Discharge to and from an Approved Centre.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Commission asked its Health, Social Care and Regulatory Forum to inform each of the professional regulatory bodies represented on the Forum, of the importance of &lsquo;the need to involve families/carers in the development of care and treatment plans with the patient&rsquo;s consent especially in cases of serious and enduring mental health problems&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  Work is underway at official level on amending the Mental Health Act and I am satisfied that the Expert Group recommendations provide a clear and well thought out direction to amend and update our mental health legislation.  While the General Scheme to be prepared will reflect the Group&rsquo;s view on the need to encourage families to be involved, it will not go so far as to recommend that this be compulsory.  </p>  <p>  I am not aware of the particular lacuna in data protection legislation that the Deputy refers to in his question.</p></reply>

Last year alone, there was a 2% increase in inpatient and day-case activity over 2015.  Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  The Inpatient / Daycase and Outpatient Plans<font color="#001FE2"> </font>which<font color="#001FE2"> </font>have now been published and are currently being implemented<font color="#001FE2">, </font>focus on reducing as much as possible within existing resources the number of patients waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and daycase treatment or outpatient appointment by the end of October.  The Scoliosis Action Plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires scoliosis surgery will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of 2017.  </p><p>Under these Plans, since early February, over 14,200 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List, nearly 49,000 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List and approximately 130 scoliosis surgeries have taken place.  </p><p>In addition, the NTPF has advised that under the ongoing Daycase Waiting List Initiative over 2,000 patients files have been transferred to private hospitals under this Initiative, 483 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that over 120 patients have received their procedure.</p></reply>

Minister McEntee has met the HSE specifically about this, and visited Linn Dara . The HSE has confirmed that no young person will be discharged from Linn Dara, unless this is deemed clinically appropriate by their mental health team.  It should be clearly understood also, that nobody is discharged simply to close a bed.</p><p>Due to staff shortages, for a variety of reasons , some beds cannot be refilled. This, unfortunately, has left Linn Dara with just half of its 22 bed complement operational.  The HSE has indicated that, for those discharged for clinical reasons, dedicated follow-on supports from the community-based CAMHS service will be provided, if deemed necessary. The Executive will also make available the CAMHS Day Service, as appropriate in individual cases, to enhance supports for young people and their families. The core issue facing Linn Dara relates specifically to staff recruitment and retention difficulties for mental health professionals. This, unfortunately, reflects wider health system issues.  The problem in this case does not relate to funding availability. Staffing cover has been augmented in recent times through methods such as staff working additional hours, overtime and engaging agency staff. </p><p>The HSE are exploring every option to maximise the operation of this service in the future. The Executive is intensifying its efforts on recruitment, and while a number of staff have been identified to join the Linn Dara service in the near future, this will take time. The Deputy may rest assured that all efforts will continue to be made to address on-going service difficulties at Linn Dara.</p><p><i>'A Vision for Change' </i>came to the end of its 10-year term in 2016. <i></i>The increased investment in mental health services over the last number of years has helped to facilitate an increase in the number and staffing levels of both Adult, and Children &amp;amp; Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams.

There has also been continued development of community mental health teams, improved 7-day responses and liaison services, Peri-natal Mental Health and two new clinical programmes &ndash; specifically for ADHD in Adults and Children, and for Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.</p></reply>

At this meeting the group highlighted a number of issues which I followed up with the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Capacity Review, published last year, identifies particular difficulties serving rural areas as population density in Ireland is significantly different to that of many other countries. The Review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary Community First Responder (CFR) schemes. The further developments of a comprehensive national programme of CFR schemes has therefore been prioritised in the HSE National Service Plan 2017. The NAS continues to work with local CFR Groups across the country, and in Connemara, in an effort to enhance services and greatly values their commitment and support.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government and the NAS are fully committed to the provision of a safe, patient focused pre-hospital emergency care service.

Each application is individually assessed to include a full review of the applicant's education and training programmes. This reviews includes all pre-registration and post registration nursing education programmes. The programmes are  compared to Irish standards of education and training for nurses. American and Australian nurses must provide the following documents in advance of their application being individually assessed:</p><p>-  Completed application form;</p><p>-  Identity documents;</p><p>-  Transcript(s) of training from their University/School of Nursing; </p><p>-  Professional Employment Reference; </p><p>-  Verification of registration and Good Standing from all Competent Authorities where they hold/held registration. </p><p>Some American and Australian applicants unfortunately do not meet NMBI standards and requirements in terms of the nursing programmes they undertook when compared to Irish  standards and requirements. Many programmes fall significantly short of the hours required for registration with NMBI or to be offered a period of adaptation/aptitude test and unfortunately these applicants are refused registration. An applicant has the right to appeal this decision within 56 days of date on decision letter. American trained applicants who only hold an Associate Degree are advised in NMBI guidance documentation that they are not eligible to apply for registration with this qualification alone as it is only a two year programme and will not meet the criteria for registration. If an American applicant who holds an Associate Degree and has taken additional relevant studies wishes to apply, the NMBI will consider their application.</p><p>It may be of interest to the Deputy to learn that as of 12<sup>th</sup>June 2017, a total number of 283 individuals who undertook their training in the United States are registered on the Active Register with NMBI.

The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. </p>  <p>  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:</p>  <p>  I.	There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease; </p>  <p>  II.	There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and </p>  <p>  III.	Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.</p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.

If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland.  Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.  The Sub-Committee first met on 6 May 2015 and it is expected to report in 2017.</p></reply>

From end April 2014 to end April 2017, total numbers employed have increased  by over 10,000 whole time equivalents to 111,979.</p>  <p>  The number of consultants has increased significantly. At the end of April 2017 there were 2,884 whole time equivalents. This constitutes an increase of 298 since April 2014. The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly, from 4,982 at the end of April 2014 to 6,092 at the end of April 2017, in order to support service delivery and progression of compliance with the provisions of the European Working Time Directive.</p>  <p>  Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of April 2017 stood at 36,549 whole time equivalents, having increased by 625 whole time equivalents in the 12 months from end April 2016 and by 1,870 in the three years from end April 2014.  Overall nursing numbers (WTEs) are at the highest level since 2011 with numbers increasing consistently since early in 2014. However, given that numbers fell by 5,000 between 2007 and 2013 and that we face increasing service demands due to a growing and ageing population there is an ongoing need to increase numbers.</p>  <p>  Under proposals formulated at the WRC between this Department, DPER, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU in February and March this year it was agreed that management would increase the nursing and midwifery workforce in 2017, through a broad range of initiatives that provide for 1,208 additional permanent posts. Delivery of these posts is possible through a combination of new development posts, for which additional funding is being provided in the current year, and the local conversion of agency employed staff into direct employees. Key measures include the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees and offering all graduating nurses and midwives full time contracts. Other important elements include enhanced maternity leave cover; a career break scheme; 130 additional undergraduate places in 2017; and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways. Recruitment measures include careers days, HSE attendance at national and international recruitment fairs, and a communication from the National Director for HR to all Nursing and Midwifery Graduates. </p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have already been taken in relation to nurses pay. These include additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale. In the last quarter of 2016 the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for 2011 to 2015 graduate nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates. All nurses and midwives are now eligible for incremental credit for the 36 week placement. </p>  <p>  In addition to the pay restoration that is provided for in the Public Service Agreements, and which commenced on 1st April, the recently concluded Draft Public Service Stability Agreement provides for pay increases from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation. It will see those earning up to &euro;30,000 receiving a 7.25% increase with the remainder receiving 5.75% over the lifetime of the agreement. However, public sector unions will have to ballot their members on acceptance or rejection of this Agreement. </p></reply>

The EMA is also key to maintaining the competitiveness of the European pharmaceutical industry, which is worth approximately &euro;260 billion annually. </p><p>  As a consequence of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, the EMA must relocate to another Member State. Approximately 20 Members States are seeking to host the Agency. The Government believes that moving the Agency to Dublin would offer a sustainable solution which will minimise any disruption to its critical operations caused by the relocation. In recent months the Minister of State for Health Promotion and I, with the support of Government colleagues and Irish diplomats across the EU, have engaged in an intensive campaign of meetings and visits to promote Dublin&rsquo;s candidacy.</p><p>  Subject to the finalisation of formal criteria and of the process to be used to arrive at a decision by Member States, it is anticipated that a formal bid must be submitted to the European Council by 31 July 2017. Government has tasked an interdepartmental/interagency group, led by my Department, with the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s bid and this group is working intensively to ensure that a high-quality bid is ready for submission by the deadline. The question of providing particular supports to a relocation of the EMA to Dublin will be considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

The HPRA report recommended that patients accessing cannabis through the programme should be under the care of a medical consultant. </p>  <p>  The Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s advice reiterates that it is crucial that the granting of a cannabis licence takes due care and consideration of the potential unintended consequences associated with the prescription of cannabis, a schedule 1 controlled drug, for medical purposes, and that its use is endorsed by a consultant who is familiar with and responsible for the care of the individual for whom the licence application is being made.</p>  <p>  It has been reported that there is a legal barrier preventing consultants from prescribing cannabis-based treatments. In fact, there is no such legal barrier. It remains open to me, as Minister for Health, to consider granting a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, where the proposed course of treatment has been endorsed by a consultant. </p></reply>

Last year alone, there was a 2% increase in inpatient and day-case activity over 2015.  Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.

The Scoliosis Action Plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires scoliosis surgery will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of 2017.  </p><p>Under these Plans, since early February, over 14,200 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List, nearly 49,000 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List and approximately 130 scoliosis surgeries have taken place.  </p><p>In addition, the NTPF has advised that under the ongoing Daycase Waiting List Initiative over 2,000 patients files have been transferred to private hospitals under this Initiative, 483 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that over 120 patients have received their procedure.</p></reply>

Critical to the success of this clinical programme will be the consolidation and further development of close working relationships between the Emergency Department clinical team, mental health liaison staff and Community Mental Health teams and GP services. </p>  <p>  The objectives of this programme are to improve the assessment and management of all individuals who present to an Emeregency Department with self-harm, reduce rates of repeated self-harm; improve access to appropriate interventions at times of personal crisis; ensure rapid and timely linkage to appropriate follow-up care, and optimise the experience of families and carers in trying to support those who present with self-harm.</p>  <p>  Following clinical assessment of a person who presents to an Emergency Department following self-harm, a decision with regard to ongoing treatment of the individual is required. This may indicate admission to a general hospital if physical care is required.  If significant mental health considerations are clinically identified, referral to mental health services in accordance with the criteria set out in the Mental Health Acts may be appropriate. </p>  <p>  Alternatively the individual could be referred to appropriate primary care services and supports.  All such clinical decisions are set out in the Discharge and Management Plan &ndash; Emergency Care Plan developed with and given to the patient and family/friend (with consent).  </p></reply>

While work is continuing on these issues, I am happy to note the significant developments that have taken place over the period.  I have met with the Chair and CEO/Master of both hospitals and reaffirmed my commitment to the project.  In addition, there has been extensive engagement between the St Vincent's Healthcare Group and my officials.</p>  <p>  On 29 May last, the Sisters of Charity announced their decision to relinquish their ownership and involvement with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  This decision, on the part of the Sisters, is an extremely significant development for the healthcare sector.  My Department has been briefed on this development.  The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's Constitution will no longer refer to the Sisters of Charity and will be amended to reflect compliance with national and international best practice guidelines on medical ethics and the laws of the Republic of Ireland.  I know that despite the specific provisions in the Mulvey agreement, there was a concern on the part of some, about the potential religious influence being brought to bear on the new maternity hospital.  The decision of the Sisters of Charity is extremely helpful in dispelling any such concerns.</p>  <p>  Discussions are continuing with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on the terms of the State's investment in the new hospital and, in particular, arrangements for the protection of this investment.  The Mulvey agreement envisaged that further consideration was required in relation to the legal mechanisms necessary to protect the State's considerable investment.  My Department is very actively engaged in devising suitable arrangements to ensure that the facilities are legally secured on an on-going basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p>  <p>  I hope to update the Government on the project very shortly.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  I am aware that in recent times, some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern to me as it has long been the position of Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.

A total of 43.3% of patients were seen within 20 working days in April. </p>  <p>  A review of cancer Rapid Access Clinics and Symptomatic Breast Disease clinics across all cancer centres has been undertaken by the National Cancer Control Programme and has been finalised recently.

I agree that greater integration of hospital waiting list management systems is a step in the right direction and  IT can play a significant role in underpinning these integrated approaches. </p>  <p>  On this basis, on 15th February during a Private Members Business debate in the Seanad regarding waiting lists and Comhliosta, I committed to asking the NTPF to establish and lead a project team of relevant experts and stakeholders to examine the feasibility of progressing to a more integrated approach to waiting list management at Hospital Group level.</p>  <p>  Over the last few months the NTPF has been scoping out the structure and format of this study.  The first meeting of the steering group took place last week and a workshop will follow later this month. I have asked the NTPF to report to me by the end of August and I will examine their recommendations once the study has been finalised.</p></reply>

I am aware that there have been many efforts over the years to realise this project on the basis of consensus which regrettably have not borne fruit.  The development of a hospice in the Midlands in addition to other planned hospices in Mayo, Waterford, Wicklow and the North East will ensure equity in the provision of specialist palliative care countrywide over the next five years. </p><p>The HSE is planning for a 16-20 bedded hospice in the Midlands on the campus of the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore. This location is viewed as best serving the interests of the 300,000 population of the Midlands. The decision to develop a single hospice rather than two smaller units is based on the most efficient use of public money. The absence of a hospice and associated day services and specialist supports in the Midlands results in higher numbers of palliative care patients dying in the region&rsquo;s three acute hospitals when they could be more appropriately cared for in a hospice setting. </p><p>It is usual for local fundraising groups to fund the capital cost of new hospice builds. However, despite ongoing efforts by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation over a protracted period it has not been possible to reach consensus on this matter and only one of the five local hospice groups has given any commitment towards capital funding for the proposed hospice.  The HSE will provide the revenue funding once the hospice is built.</p><p>To advance the Midlands hospice project, the HSE is reviewing planning work to date and will develop plans for submission to the HSE National Director for Primary Care and the HSE Capital Estates Steering Group in September. Key deliverables include a revised schedule of accommodation, a revised brief, indicative capital costings, the precise location of the hospice on the Tullamore Hospital campus, staffing requirements and indicative costings, and a communication and engagement plan. The HSE will continue to engage with local hospice groups as this preparatory work progresses.</p></reply>

This clinical care is delivered in close collaboration with related education and research programmes in the National University of Ireland, Galway.</p>  <p>  During 2015 a consultant vacancy arose in the paediatric diabetes service at Galway University Hospital.  The Saolta Healthcare Group prioritised the filling of this consultant paediatric diabetes specialist post and a candidate was selected in late 2015.  However delays arose, and in February 2017 the Hospital was advised that the candidate was no longer in a position to take up the post.</p>  <p>  In light of the importance of this post, it has been re-advertised by the Public Appointments Service as a priority, and applications have now been received.  The HSE is actively engaging with the Public Appointments Service in order to fill this critical post as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  In the interim, the Saolta Healthcare Group has been making every effort to provide appropriate diabetes care services to paediatric patients. Children under the age of 12 years are currently referred to University Hospital Limerick for diabetes treatment, while patients aged 12 years and over are commenced on insulin pump therapy under the guidance of a consultant endocrinologist at GUH.</p>  <p>  The Saolta Healthcare Group has advised that it is committed to urgently recruiting a permanent paediatric diabetes consultant to Galway University Hospital in order that the Hospital can provide comprehensive paediatric diabetes services, so that children do not have to travel to hospitals outside the Hospital Group.</p></reply>

The National Competitiveness Council recently published its annual Costs of Doing Business 2017 report which examines a range of enterprise costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit, and business services. The Council concluded that while Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years - making Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in - Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a number of key business inputs. In the Council's report, Ireland&rsquo;s current price profile is described as &lsquo;high cost, rising slowly&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  The report from Eurostat referenced also concludes that Ireland is a higher cost location. Ireland, in 2016, was the second most expensive country in Europe for goods and services behind only Denmark and slightly more expensive than both Luxembourg and Sweden. Prices on average here were some 25.6 per cent higher than the EU28 average.  For key business inputs, including telecommunications and transport Ireland were 33.6 and 4.3 per cent more expensive than the EU28 average. For education, Irish prices were almost 5 per cent lower than the comparable average. </p>  <p>  Recent inflation data, however, reaffirms the NCC&rsquo;s price profile as high cost yet rising slowly. Annual inflation for 2016 was 0 per cent according to the Central Statistics Office. The overall Consumer Prices Index (CPI) shows that prices on average rose by 0.2% in the year to May 2017. Conversely, on a monthly basis, price actually fell by 0.2% between April and May 2017. Prices, as measured by Eurostat&rsquo;s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) &ndash; decreased slightly in 2016.  Irish inflation rates are forecast at 0.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.2 per cent in 2018.The projected path for inflation over the medium term reflects the impact of higher import prices following the depreciation of Sterling over the past year as a result of Britain&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  The aforementioned report of the National Competitiveness Council is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness. To protect the gains achieved to date, to sustain economic growth, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our cost competitiveness.

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers, staff and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. </p>  <p>  The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it they should indemnify the school. </p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to administer medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupil/pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to administer the type of medicine which may be required.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher (2012 entrant) from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. The comparable starting salary for a pre-2011 entrant post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 (i.e. if full equalisation to pre-2011 pay rates for teachers was achieved) would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  Further to the this newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward circular which reduced the qualifying period for a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.  In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers include a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before.</p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. </p></reply>

That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to targeted police operations. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. </p><p>In this context, the Government on 24 June 2016 authorised the then Minister to request the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. The pilot will feed into the wider review being undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities. </p><p>The Commissioner submitted a first Interim Report on 6 March 2017, which set out a timeline for completion of the exercise, including the delivery of a final report in May/June 2017.  On 9 June 2017 a second Interim Report was submitted, in which the Commissioner indicated that she will be submitting her Final Report at the end of this month.  In the most recent Interim  Report, the Commissioner, having analysed population and crime trends, and taking account of the availability of stations for reuse, recommends that Stepaside Station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis subject to the necessary consultation with the Office of Public Works. On the same basis, the Commissioner makes a number of other recommendations including that if the Government decides to reopen two Stations in Dublin, that Rush Station in north Co. Dublin be reopened. However, the Commissioner requests that a decision on Rush be deferred until her final report is received to allow time for further analysis to be carried out. The Commissioner has also indicated that she is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Leighlinbridge Station in Co. Carlow and Donard Station in Co. Wicklow, in her final report. The Commissioner has also highlighted the need to develop new stations to meet identified policing requirements at Dublin Airport and at Dublin Port. </p><p>  At its meeting on 13 June, the Government agreed to note the key recommendations in the Commissioner&rsquo;s report and to agree, in principle, to the reopening of Stepaside Garda Station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed and that the decision to reopen Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard Stations will be taken when the final report is received from the Commissioner at the end of June. </p><p>The Policing Authority has commissioned the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, on foot of a request from the former Minister, to review the dispersement of Garda Stations in the State and the boundaries of Garda Districts. This review is on-going and a report is expected later this year.</p></reply>

The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.</p>  <p>  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:</p>  <p>  1. There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease;</p>  <p>  2.-There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and</p>  <p>  3. Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the IDSA) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology,  Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland. Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.</p>  <p>  Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications are a matter for the Department of  Employment and Social Protection.</p></reply>

The Action Plan outlines the actions needed to enhance breastfeeding rates and provide skilled supports to mothers, through our maternity services, hospitals, primary care services and in partnership with voluntary breastfeeding organisations and other stakeholders.</p><p>These actions include the implementation of policies at hospital and community level; investment in breastfeeding training and skills development for healthcare staff; and partnership working to promote a culture that accepts and supports breastfeeding.  The Action Plan is available at .</p><p>I am also pleased to advise the deputy that breastfeeding initiatives are also reflected in the Creating a Better Future Together: National Maternity Strategy 2016-2026.  This national strategy emphasised the importance of dedicated staff, such as the HSE National Breastfeeding Coordinator and statutory and voluntary supports, in promoting and supporting breastfeeding in Ireland.  It referred to the National Breastfeeding Coordinator that works with a national committee to oversee the implementation of breastfeeding action plans and monitors progress in relation to breastfeeding targets; liaising with local breastfeeding committees, maternity hospitals, community health services and voluntary breastfeeding organisations.</p><p>Initiatives referred to in the national strategy included an annual National Breastfeeding Week, the HSE website , and an on-line Ask the Expert support service provided by International Board Certiﬁed Lactation Consultants.  Other initiatives mentioned included breastfeeding support groups, the development of a breastfeeding competencies framework, and a breastfeeding policy for primary care teams and community healthcare settings.</p><p>Moreover, the National Maternity Strategy reiterated that along with practical supports that can be provided to mothers, such as supports to continue breastfeeding on return to the workplace, a broader societal change is required in order to promote a more positive culture around breastfeeding.  This should support women to feel conﬁdent about their choice to breastfeed.  The Maternity Strategy emphasised that this includes engaging extended family members and childminders who, perhaps due to not being aware of the importance of breastfeeding, may not be best informed to support a family&rsquo;s choice to feed their baby expressed breast milk while in their care.  It referred to breastfeeding promotion campaigns that should be tailored and targeted to help the wider community, including family members, childminders and employers, to play their role in improving Ireland&rsquo;s breastfeeding initiation and duration rates.</p><p>I want to also assure the deputy that the recently published Dept. of Justice and Equality National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017 - 2020: creating a better society for all, contains two actions on increasing the proportion of mothers who breastfeed.</p><p>There are some resources available to healthcare professionals in relation the use of medicinal products by breastfeeding mothers. In the first instance the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) should be consulted whenever a practitioner is considering prescribing a medicine to a breast-feeding mother or where the healthcare professional requires information on the suitability of a medicine for breast feeding.</p><p>Under EU legislation, product information associated with a medicine consists of the SmPC and the package leaflet. The SmPC is a legal document approved as part of the marketing authorisation of each medicine and forms the basis of information for healthcare professionals on how to use the medicine.  This information is presented according to a predefined structure and includes the situations where the medicine must not be used, defining patient populations who must not take the medicines, and special warnings and precautions on the use of the medicine.  This includes qualitative and quantitative information on the benefits and the risks posed by the medicine.  Section 4.6 of the SmPC provides available information regarding the use of the drug during pregnancy and recommendations on the use or not of the medicine during pregnancy.  Recommendation on the need to stop or continue breastfeeding while on the medicine is also provided.</p><p>The information contained within the SmPC is updated throughout the lifecycle of the medicine as new data emerge.</p><p>The decision on whether to use a medicine during breastfeeding should be reached following a discussion between a prescriber and their patient about the potential risks and benefits of that  medicine.  In accordance with the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics, medical practitioners must ensure as far as possible that any treatment, medication or therapy prescribed for a patient is safe, evidence-based and in the patient&rsquo;s best interests.</p><p>Patients with queries about the suitability of using a medicine during breast feeding are encouraged to speak to their pharmacist or general practitioner.</p><p>Finally, as the questions from the deputy relate mainly to service issues, I have arranged for them to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply on some of the specifics referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Last year alone, there was a 2% increase in inpatient and day-case activity over 2015. </p><p>Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services. The Inpatient / Daycase and Outpatient Plans<font color="#001FE2"> </font>which<font color="#001FE2"> </font>have now been published and currently being implemented<font color="#001FE2">,  </font>focus on reducing the number of patients waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and daycase treatment or outpatient appointment as much as possible within existing resources by the end of October. The Scoliosis Action Plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires scoliosis surgery will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of 2017.

The Programme for Government commits to extending in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, free GP care to all children under 18 years of age.  Legislative changes will be required for any such extension of GP care without fees to further cohorts of the population and the timetable will be subject to the outcome of discussions with GP representatives on this and other contractual matters.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future. Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. These include increases in the number of GP training places, which have risen from 120 places in 2009 to 171 places being formally accepted for the 2017 training intake as of 13th June. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices has also been introduced. In addition, the GP contracts review process which is currently underway will seek to arrive at contractual arrangements which will ensure that general practice is an attractive, fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p>  <p>   In September 2015, the HSE published a medical workforce planning report on the future demand for GPs in Ireland and identified a current under-supply of GPs. A follow-up review of workforce planning for general practice will be carried out by the HSE in the coming months. The results of this will assist in the development of plans for further expansion in GP training capacity and trainee numbers.</p></reply>

Government policy is therefore to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide optimal clinical outcomes. Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise. </p>  <p>  Following the Government's decision to locate the new children's hospital at the St James's Hospital campus, it was necessary to review the recommendations made in 2008 KPMG Report 'Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area' in relation to the preferred sites for maternity hospitals in Dublin. As a result of that review it was decided that the Rotunda Hospital will be co-located with adult acute services at Connolly Hospital campus, Blanchardstown. </p>  <p>  While the Rotunda redevelopment project is still at a very early stage of development, I am aware that the hospital has commissioned consultants to prepare a draft Design Brief. In addition, work is underway on a Development Control Plan for the Connolly campus which will inform the precise location of the new hospital on the campus. </p>  <p>  During 2017 my Department is working with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct a mid-term review of the capital programme. Prioritisation of funding for the new Rotunda Hospital will be considered in the context of that review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-21a.520.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100081#WRJ04800"><p>Spurdog (now referred to as Picked Dogfish) is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is therefore particularly vulnerable to fishing mortality. Current advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is that there should be no target fishery and that by-catch in mixed fisheries should be reduced to the lowest possible level. It recommends that a rebuilding plan should be developed for this stock. Spurdog spawning biomass is currently at the lowest observed level, although conservation measures have stabilised the decline in recent years. </p>  <p>  The Marine Institute supports ICES advice and further notes that spatial avoidance measures should be put in place to avoid large catches of accidental by-catch.   In terms of our responsibility to ensure the long-term sustainability of this stock and on the basis of firm scientific advice, there does not appear to be a case for the re-opening of a commercial fishery for Spurdog at this time.</p>  <p>  The EU Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for dogfish was set at 270 tonnes for 2017 with 53 tonnes available to Ireland. This quota is only available, under EU law, to support a bycatch avoidance scheme, as approved by the European Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), is in place.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has submitted a proposal for such a by catch avoidance scheme to the Commission and this will be assessed at the July Plenary meeting of STECF. It is intended that this pilot scheme will further increase our knowledge of the stock, aid in its recovery and help ensure its long-term sustainability on the basis of firm scientific evidence.</p>  <p>  If the assessment by STECF is positive, the by catch avoidance programme will then be brought to the Quota Management Advisory Committee  (involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors) for further development, and subsequently go to public consultation.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>In April, eir signed an agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website <i>.</i></p><p>Quarterly updates will be published on the Departments website.I am pleased to announce that the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.</p><p>The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken purely on commercial grounds. Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p><p>I also published in April an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .The Map shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>There are approximately 2.3m premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 542,000 (23%) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.  These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the State Intervention procurement process.  The remaining 1.8m  premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be/are served by commercial operators. Of the 1.8m premises, 300,000 premises fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <font color="#1F497D">.</font></p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at .</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. </p><p>The procurement is progressing to the next stage. This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017. This is a significant milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.</p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, established an Implementation Group. This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery. This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website  at and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. </p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas. The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The National Mitigation Plan has been prepared having regard to the provisions set out in the 2015 Act in close collaboration with all relevant Government Departments and, in particular, with the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport; Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. As well as being supported by a range of technical, economic and environmental inputs, the National Mitigation Plan has also been informed by the submissions received during a public consultation in March and April 2017.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I invited the Climate Change Advisory Council, following my publication of the draft National Mitigation Plan, to engage directly with me and with other relevant Government Ministers with a view to providing its recommendations to feed into the preparation of the final Plan. All input received from the Advisory Council has being considered in finalising the National Mitigation Plan.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the 2015 Act, the National Mitigation Plan was circulated to Government before 10 June, 2017. In line with the provisions of the Act, Government must approve the National Mitigation Plan or approve it with such modifications as they consider appropriate. Once such approval has been given, I am looking forward to publishing the National Mitigation Plan as soon as possible thereafter.    </p></reply>

This oversight does not substitute for the responsibility of regulated entities to ensure compliance. </p>  <p>  It is also to be noted that the 2016 EU Commission Inspection of the Irish Appropriate Authority, which includes as assessment of its capability to fulfil the NCASQCP, has been closed with no outstanding findings. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, in order to ensure the sustainability of the current arrangements, my Department made a commitment at the National Civil Aviation Development Forum earlier this year, to bring forward legislative amendments to extend the existing cost recovery mechanism which is used currently to support the IAA Safety Regulation Directorate activities to also include its aviation security regulation functions and activities. This could also support the engagement of additional  resources if deemed necessary by the IAA subject to its ongoing assessment of capacity to meet aviation security regulation requirements.</p>  <p>  My Department as part of a wider proposal for aviation security and safety consulted last year on proposed legislative amendments which would support cost recovery by the IAA to extend to aviation security regulation. This aspect of the proposal will be expedited this year and my Department will shortly bring forward a Memorandum for Government seeking permission to proceed to drafting of legislation on this matter.</p></reply>

Since the launch of the recent campaign on 18 April last, 4,859 reports have been received from members of the public.  This compares with some 3,322 reports which were received over the same period in 2016.  The reports are now being examined and will be referred for follow-up action by the Department, where this is warranted based on the information provided.  This work will be carried out over the coming weeks and months. </p>  <p>  A determination of fraud can only be made after a detailed investigation by a social welfare inspector (SWI) and the making of a revised decision under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 by one of the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers.  The person concerned has a right to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeal Office where the facts are disputed.  The outcome of an investigation may determine that the claim is correct, that the customer was in error or fraud is present.  The payment to the person concerned may be either terminated or reduced in value based on the outcome of the investigation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that all reports received do not lead to an investigation.  A preliminary examination of each report is undertaken for relevance and to identify the person reported.  Once a person can be identified, the next step is to establish if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Where a person can be identified, is receiving a payment and sufficient information is provided to warrant further examination, the report is referred to the relevant scheme area in the Department or to a SWI for further investigation.  A payment will not be suspended or stopped on the basis of the report received from a member of the public.  The Department can only take this action as a result of an investigation and the making of a statutory decision.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation defines a person as requiring full time care and attention where the person has such a disability that s/he requires</p><p>a) continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions, or </p><p>b) continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself/herself. </p><p>The exact amount of hours or days for which care must be provided is not defined. However, one of the tests to decide if full-time care and attention is being provided is whether the care given addresses the above issues. </p><p>My Department takes the view that full-time care and attention does not necessarily mean 24 hours in each day. Full-time care and attention can be considered to apply where there is an ongoing and daily commitment by the carer and which also generally results in the carer not being able to support themselves through normal full-time employment. </p><p>The person concerned was refused carer&rsquo;s allowance on the grounds that, based on the evidence available to the Deciding Officer in the case, she was not providing full-time care and attention as required. The person concerned was notified on 2 May 2017 of this decision, the reason for it and of her right of review and appeal. To date, no request for a review or appeal has been received from the person concerned. </p><p>If the person concerned wishes to provide further information on the hours of care she is providing, her case will be reviewed.  To date, there has been no new information submitted which would warrant a review of the decision made in this case.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

At 20 years old, the original site was showing its age.  For example, although it enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, it wasn&rsquo;t possible for employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, my Department issued a tender for the development and implementation of a new service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles are automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers.  The system will also integrate with my Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  Through a link with my Department&rsquo;s Activation Case Management system, it will facilitate case officers to further support and monitor jobseeker employment search activity.</p>  <p>  Following the procurement process, a young Irish technology company is building and delivering the new service.  The contract is for a fixed fee of &euro;3.36 million, payable over the first 5 years of a 5.5 year service period (the final 6 months of the service is payment free).  The contract includes an optional extension period of 3 years, with the overall term not exceeding 8.5 years in total. </p>  <p>  The new service was introduced in July 2016 and the total cost to date is almost &euro;1,174,000.</p>  <p>  There were some teething problems with the first phase implementation, but performance issues have now been resolved.  Employers can now register and post vacancies, and candidates can register and upload CVs and apply for vacancies online.  In addition, the system automatically matches candidates to employer specifications and both parties are notified of successful matches.  There are currently almost 6,000 positions advertised on the site.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the supplier to enhance the service and will add additional functionality over the coming months.  Anyone experiencing difficulties with the website can contact the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre on 1890 800 024 for assistance.</p></reply>

However, the provisions of this legislation are generally taken as applicable in dwellings within multi-unit developments or mixed-use buildings. </p><p>Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Building Control Act 1990 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, all of which may be relevant in relation to fire safety arrangements in residential buildings, other than those specifically excluded. Details in relation to inspections and notices issued by fire services up to 2015 are available on my Department's website at the link below; 2016 information should be available shortly. </p><p>.</p><p>There is no limitation on who can make a call for assistance to 999/112 from any of the Emergency Services, should it be required. The caller should provide as much information as possible, listening and carefully following the advice being given by the call takers, who are trained for that purpose. In some cases a monitored Automatic Fire Alarm system may be in place, however this is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p>In response to the recent tragedy at Grenfell Tower in London, I have requested that each local authority be asked, as a matter of urgency, to review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are in place and fully functional. Life safety must be our first concern.  </p><p>In terms of raising awareness across landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, I have requested that the Residential Tenancies Board be asked to notify all landlords of their responsibilities and obligations as landlords in terms of ensuring that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements.  </p><p>In order to remind builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners of their obligations in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations, I have also requested that a notification be issued to all registered users (approx. 52,000) through the Building Control Management System (BCMS).</p><p>Although there are no apartment blocks in Ireland comparable to Grenfell Tower, all householders, regardless of the type of accommodation they live in, are urged to take the basic but most effective fire safety precaution of ensuring that their family&rsquo;s home is protected with working smoke alarms. I have also emphasised the fire safety responsibilities of management companies more generally in control of multi-occupancy buildings and urged them to satisfy themselves that the arrangements in place are appropriate and safe.</p></reply>
